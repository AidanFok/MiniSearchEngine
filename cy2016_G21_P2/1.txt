scene ii  london  an apartment of the prince s 


enter the prince of wales and falstaff


falstaff

now  hal  what time of day is it  lad 


prince henry

thou art so fat witted  with drinking of old sack
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
benches after noon  that thou hast forgotten to
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know 
what a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
day  unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
signs of leaping houses and the blessed sun himself
a fair hot wench in flame coloured taffeta  i see no
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
the time of the day 


falstaff

indeed  you come near me now  hal  for we that take
purses go by the moon and the seven stars  and not
by phoebus  he wandering knight so fair  and 
i prithee  sweet wag  when thou art king  as  god
save thy grace majesty i should say  for grace
thou wilt have none 


prince henry

what  none 


falstaff

no  by my troth  not so much as will serve to
prologue to an egg and butter 


prince henry

well  how then  come  roundly  roundly 


falstaff

marry  then  sweet wag  when thou art king  let not
us that are squires of the night body be called
thieves of the day beauty  let us be diana 
foresters  gentlemen of the shade  minions of the
moon  and let men say we be men of good government 
being governed  as the sea is  by our noble and
chaste mistress the moon  under whose countenance we steal 


prince henry

thou sayest well  and it holds well too  for the
fortune of us that are the moon men doth ebb and
flow like the sea  being governed  as the sea is 
by the moon  as  for proof  now  a purse of gold
most resolutely snatched on monday night and most
dissolutely spent on tuesday morning  got with
swearing  by  and spent with crying  in 
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows 


falstaff

by the lord  thou sayest true  lad  and is not my
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench 


prince henry

as the honey of hybla  my old lad of the castle  and
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance 


falstaff

how now  how now  mad wag  what  in thy quips and
thy quiddities  what a plague have i to do with a
buff jerkin 


prince henry

why  what a pox have i to do with my hostess of the tavern 


falstaff

well  thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
time and oft 


prince henry

did i ever call for thee to pay thy part 


falstaff

no  i give thee thy due  thou hast paid all there 


prince henry

yea  and elsewhere  so far as my coin would stretch 
and where it would not  i have used my credit 


falstaff

yea  and so used it that were it not here apparent
that thou art heir apparent but  i prithee  sweet
wag  shall there be gallows standing in england when
thou art king  and resolution thus fobbed as it is
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law  do
not thou  when thou art king  hang a thief 


prince henry

no  thou shalt 


falstaff

shall i  o rare  by the lord  i be a brave judge 


prince henry

thou judgest false already  i mean  thou shalt have
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman 


falstaff

well  hal  well  and in some sort it jumps with my
humour as well as waiting in the court  i can tell
you 


prince henry

for obtaining of suits 


falstaff

yea  for obtaining of suits  whereof the hangman
hath no lean wardrobe   sblood  i am as melancholy
as a gib cat or a lugged bear 


prince henry

or an old lion  or a lover lute 


falstaff

yea  or the drone of a lincolnshire bagpipe 


prince henry

what sayest thou to a hare  or the melancholy of
moor ditch 


falstaff

thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
the most comparative  rascalliest  sweet young
prince  but  hal  i prithee  trouble me no more
with vanity  i would to god thou and i knew where a
commodity of good names were to be bought  an old
lord of the council rated me the other day in the
street about you  sir  but i marked him not  and yet
he talked very wisely  but i regarded him not  and
yet he talked wisely  and in the street too 


prince henry

thou didst well  for wisdom cries out in the
streets  and no man regards it 


falstaff

o  thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
to corrupt a saint  thou hast done much harm upon
me  hal  god forgive thee for it  before i knew
thee  hal  i knew nothing  and now am i  if a man
should speak truly  little better than one of the
wicked  i must give over this life  and i will give
it over  by the lord  and i do not  i am a villain 
i be damned for never a king son in
christendom 


prince henry

where shall we take a purse tomorrow  jack 


falstaff

 zounds  where thou wilt  lad  i make one  an i
do not  call me villain and baffle me 


prince henry

i see a good amendment of life in thee  from praying
to purse taking 


falstaff

why  hal   my vocation  hal   no sin for a
man to labour in his vocation 
enter poins
poins  now shall we know if gadshill have set a
match  o  if men were to be saved by merit  what
hole in hell were hot enough for him  this is the
most omnipotent villain that ever cried  stand  to
a true man 


prince henry

good morrow  ned 


poins

good morrow  sweet hal  what says monsieur remorse 
what says sir john sack and sugar  jack  how
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul  that thou
soldest him on good friday last for a cup of madeira
and a cold capon leg 


prince henry

sir john stands to his word  the devil shall have
his bargain  for he was never yet a breaker of
proverbs  he will give the devil his due 


poins

then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil 


prince henry

else he had been damned for cozening the devil 


poins

but  my lads  my lads  to morrow morning  by four
o clock  early at gadshill  there are pilgrims going
to canterbury with rich offerings  and traders
riding to london with fat purses  i have vizards
for you all  you have horses for yourselves 
gadshill lies to night in rochester  i have bespoke
supper to morrow night in eastcheap  we may do it
as secure as sleep  if you will go  i will stuff
your purses full of crowns  if you will not  tarry
at home and be hanged 


falstaff

hear ye  yedward  if i tarry at home and go not 
i hang you for going 


poins

you will  chops 


falstaff

hal  wilt thou make one 


prince henry

who  i rob  i a thief  not i  by my faith 


falstaff

there neither honesty  manhood  nor good
fellowship in thee  nor thou camest not of the blood
royal  if thou darest not stand for ten shillings 


prince henry

well then  once in my days i be a madcap 


falstaff

why  that well said 


prince henry

well  come what will  i tarry at home 


falstaff

by the lord  i be a traitor then  when thou art king 


prince henry

i care not 


poins

sir john  i prithee  leave the prince and me alone 
i will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
that he shall go 


falstaff

well  god give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
the ears of profiting  that what thou speakest may
move and what he hears may be believed  that the
true prince may  for recreation sake  prove a false
thief  for the poor abuses of the time want
countenance  farewell  you shall find me in eastcheap 


prince henry

farewell  thou latter spring  farewell  all hallown summer 
exit falstaff


poins

now  my good sweet honey lord  ride with us
to morrow  i have a jest to execute that i cannot
manage alone  falstaff  bardolph  peto and gadshill
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid 
yourself and i will not be there  and when they
have the booty  if you and i do not rob them  cut
this head off from my shoulders 


prince henry

how shall we part with them in setting forth 


poins

why  we will set forth before or after them  and
appoint them a place of meeting  wherein it is at
our pleasure to fail  and then will they adventure
upon the exploit themselves  which they shall have
no sooner achieved  but we set upon them 


prince henry

yea  but  like that they will know us by our
horses  by our habits and by every other
appointment  to be ourselves 


poins

tut  our horses they shall not see  i tie them
in the wood  our vizards we will change after we
leave them  and  sirrah  i have cases of buckram
for the nonce  to immask our noted outward garments 


prince henry

yea  but i doubt they will be too hard for us 


poins

well  for two of them  i know them to be as
true bred cowards as ever turned back  and for the
third  if he fight longer than he sees reason  i 
forswear arms  the virtue of this jest will be  the
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
tell us when we meet at supper  how thirty  at
least  he fought with  what wards  what blows  what
extremities he endured  and in the reproof of this
lies the jest 


prince henry

well  i go with thee  provide us all things
necessary and meet me to morrow night in eastcheap 
there i sup  farewell 


poins

farewell  my lord 
exit poins


prince henry

i know you all  and will awhile uphold
the unyoked humour of your idleness 
yet herein will i imitate the sun 
who doth permit the base contagious clouds
to smother up his beauty from the world 
that  when he please again to be himself 
being wanted  he may be more wonder at 
by breaking through the foul and ugly mists
of vapours that did seem to strangle him 
if all the year were playing holidays 
to sport would be as tedious as to work 
but when they seldom come  they wish for come 
and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents 
so  when this loose behavior i throw off
and pay the debt i never promised 
by how much better than my word i am 
by so much shall i falsify men hopes 
and like bright metal on a sullen ground 
my reformation  glittering o my fault 
shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
than that which hath no foil to set it off 
i so offend  to make offence a skill 
redeeming time when men think least i will 
exit
