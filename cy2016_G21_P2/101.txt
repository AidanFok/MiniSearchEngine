scene iii  france  king lewis xi palace 


flourish  enter king lewis xi  his sister bona   his admiral  called bourbon  prince edward  queen  margaret  and oxford  king lewis xi sits  and riseth up again


king lewis xi

fair queen of england  worthy margaret 
sit down with us  it ill befits thy state
and birth  that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit 


queen margaret

no  mighty king of france  now margaret
must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
where kings command  i was  i must confess 
great albion queen in former golden days 
but now mischance hath trod my title down 
and with dishonour laid me on the ground 
where i must take like seat unto my fortune 
and to my humble seat conform myself 


king lewis xi

why  say  fair queen  whence springs this deep despair 


queen margaret

from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
and stops my tongue  while heart is drown in cares 


king lewis xi

whate it be  be thou still like thyself 
and sit thee by our side 
seats her by him
yield not thy neck
to fortune yoke  but let thy dauntless mind
still ride in triumph over all mischance 
be plain  queen margaret  and tell thy grief 
it shall be eased  if france can yield relief 


queen margaret

those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
and give my tongue tied sorrows leave to speak 
now  therefore  be it known to noble lewis 
that henry  sole possessor of my love 
is of a king become a banish man 
and forced to live in scotland a forlorn 
while proud ambitious edward duke of york
usurps the regal title and the seat
of england true anointed lawful king 
this is the cause that i  poor margaret 
with this my son  prince edward  henry heir 
am come to crave thy just and lawful aid 
and if thou fail us  all our hope is done 
scotland hath will to help  but cannot help 
our people and our peers are both misled 
our treasures seized  our soldiers put to flight 
and  as thou seest  ourselves in heavy plight 


king lewis xi

renowned queen  with patience calm the storm 
while we bethink a means to break it off 


queen margaret

the more we stay  the stronger grows our foe 


king lewis xi

the more i stay  the more i succor thee 


queen margaret

o  but impatience waiteth on true sorrow 
and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow 
enter warwick


king lewis xi

what he approacheth boldly to our presence 


queen margaret

our earl of warwick  edward greatest friend 


king lewis xi

welcome  brave warwick  what brings thee to france 
he descends  she ariseth


queen margaret

ay  now begins a second storm to rise 
for this is he that moves both wind and tide 


warwick

from worthy edward  king of albion 
my lord and sovereign  and thy vowed friend 
i come  in kindness and unfeigned love 
first  to do greetings to thy royal person 
and then to crave a league of amity 
and lastly  to confirm that amity
with a nuptial knot  if thou vouchsafe to grant
that virtuous lady bona  thy fair sister 
to england king in lawful marriage 


queen margaret

 aside   if that go forward  henry hope is done 


warwick

 to bona   and  gracious madam  in our king behalf 
i am commanded  with your leave and favour 
humbly to kiss your hand  and with my tongue
to tell the passion of my sovereign heart 
where fame  late entering at his heedful ears 
hath placed thy beauty image and thy virtue 


queen margaret

king lewis and lady bona  hear me speak 
before you answer warwick  his demand
springs not from edward well meant honest love 
but from deceit bred by necessity 
for how can tyrants safely govern home 
unless abroad they purchase great alliance 
to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice 
that henry liveth still  but were he dead 
yet here prince edward stands  king henry son 
look  therefore  lewis  that by this league and marriage
thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour 
for though usurpers sway the rule awhile 
yet heavens are just  and time suppresseth wrongs 


warwick

injurious margaret 


prince edward

and why not queen 


warwick

because thy father henry did usurp 
and thou no more are prince than she is queen 


oxford

then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt 
which did subdue the greatest part of spain 
and  after john of gaunt  henry the fourth 
whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest 
and  after that wise prince  henry the fifth 
who by his prowess conquered all france 
from these our henry lineally descends 


warwick

oxford  how haps it  in this smooth discourse 
you told not how henry the sixth hath lost
all that which henry fifth had gotten 
methinks these peers of france should smile at that 
but for the rest  you tell a pedigree
of threescore and two years  a silly time
to make prescription for a kingdom worth 


oxford

why  warwick  canst thou speak against thy liege 
whom thou obeyed thirty and six years 
and not bewray thy treason with a blush 


warwick

can oxford  that did ever fence the right 
now buckler falsehood with a pedigree 
for shame  leave henry  and call edward king 


oxford

call him my king by whose injurious doom
my elder brother  the lord aubrey vere 
was done to death  and more than so  my father 
even in the downfall of his mellow years 
when nature brought him to the door of death 
no  warwick  no  while life upholds this arm 
this arm upholds the house of lancaster 


warwick

and i the house of york 


king lewis xi

queen margaret  prince edward  and oxford 
vouchsafe  at our request  to stand aside 
while i use further conference with warwick 
they stand aloof


queen margaret

heavens grant that warwick words bewitch him not 


king lewis xi

now warwick  tell me  even upon thy conscience 
is edward your true king  for i were loath
to link with him that were not lawful chosen 


warwick

thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour 


king lewis xi

but is he gracious in the people eye 


warwick

the more that henry was unfortunate 


king lewis xi

then further  all dissembling set aside 
tell me for truth the measure of his love
unto our sister bona 


warwick

such it seems
as may beseem a monarch like himself 
myself have often heard him say and swear
that this his love was an eternal plant 
whereof the root was fix in virtue ground 
the leaves and fruit maintain with beauty sun 
exempt from envy  but not from disdain 
unless the lady bona quit his pain 


king lewis xi

now  sister  let us hear your firm resolve 


bona

your grant  or your denial  shall be mine 
to warwick
yet i confess that often ere this day 
when i have heard your king desert recounted 
mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire 


king lewis xi

then  warwick  thus  our sister shall be edward s 
and now forthwith shall articles be drawn
touching the jointure that your king must make 
which with her dowry shall be counterpoised 
draw near  queen margaret  and be a witness
that bona shall be wife to the english king 


prince edward

to edward  but not to the english king 


queen margaret

deceitful warwick  it was thy device
by this alliance to make void my suit 
before thy coming lewis was henry friend 


king lewis xi

and still is friend to him and margaret 
but if your title to the crown be weak 
as may appear by edward good success 
then  but reason that i be released
from giving aid which late i promised 
yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
that your estate requires and mine can yield 


warwick

henry now lives in scotland at his ease 
where having nothing  nothing can he lose 
and as for you yourself  our quondam queen 
you have a father able to maintain you 
and better  you troubled him than france 


queen margaret

peace  impudent and shameless warwick  peace 
proud setter up and puller down of kings 
i will not hence  till  with my talk and tears 
both full of truth  i make king lewis behold
thy sly conveyance and thy lord false love 
for both of you are birds of selfsame feather 
post blows a horn within


king lewis xi

warwick  this is some post to us or thee 
enter a post


post

 to warwick   my lord ambassador  these letters are for you 
sent from your brother  marquess montague 
to king lewis xi
these from our king unto your majesty 
to queen margaret
and  madam  these for you  from whom i know not 
they all read their letters


oxford

i like it well that our fair queen and mistress
smiles at her news  while warwick frowns at his 


prince edward

nay  mark how lewis stamps  as he were nettled 
i hope all for the best 


king lewis xi

warwick  what are thy news  and yours  fair queen 


queen margaret

mine  such as fill my heart with unhoped joys 


warwick

mine  full of sorrow and heart discontent 


king lewis xi

what  has your king married the lady grey 
and now  to soothe your forgery and his 
sends me a paper to persuade me patience 
is this the alliance that he seeks with france 
dare he presume to scorn us in this manner 


queen margaret

i told your majesty as much before 
this proveth edward love and warwick honesty 


warwick

king lewis  i here protest  in sight of heaven 
and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss 
that i am clear from this misdeed of edward s 
no more my king  for he dishonours me 
but most himself  if he could see his shame 
did i forget that by the house of york
my father came untimely to his death 
did i let pass the abuse done to my niece 
did i impale him with the regal crown 
did i put henry from his native right 
and am i guerdon at the last with shame 
shame on himself  for my desert is honour 
and to repair my honour lost for him 
i here renounce him and return to henry 
my noble queen  let former grudges pass 
and henceforth i am thy true servitor 
i will revenge his wrong to lady bona 
and replant henry in his former state 


queen margaret

warwick  these words have turn my hate to love 
and i forgive and quite forget old faults 
and joy that thou becomest king henry friend 


warwick

so much his friend  ay  his unfeigned friend 
that  if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
with some few bands of chosen soldiers 
i undertake to land them on our coast
and force the tyrant from his seat by war 
 not his new made bride shall succor him 
and as for clarence  as my letters tell me 
he very likely now to fall from him 
for matching more for wanton lust than honour 
or than for strength and safety of our country 


bona

dear brother  how shall bona be revenged
but by thy help to this distressed queen 


queen margaret

renowned prince  how shall poor henry live 
unless thou rescue him from foul despair 


bona

my quarrel and this english queen are one 


warwick

and mine  fair lady bona  joins with yours 


king lewis xi

and mine with hers  and thine  and margaret s 
therefore at last i firmly am resolved
you shall have aid 


queen margaret

let me give humble thanks for all at once 


king lewis xi

then  england messenger  return in post 
and tell false edward  thy supposed king 
that lewis of france is sending over masquers
to revel it with him and his new bride 
thou seest what past  go fear thy king withal 


bona

tell him  in hope he prove a widower shortly 
i wear the willow garland for his sake 


queen margaret

tell him  my mourning weeds are laid aside 
and i am ready to put armour on 


warwick

tell him from me that he hath done me wrong 
and therefore i uncrown him ere be long 
there thy reward  be gone 
exit post


king lewis xi

but  warwick 
thou and oxford  with five thousand men 
shall cross the seas  and bid false edward battle 
and  as occasion serves  this noble queen
and prince shall follow with a fresh supply 
yet  ere thou go  but answer me one doubt 
what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty 


warwick

this shall assure my constant loyalty 
that if our queen and this young prince agree 
i join mine eldest daughter and my joy
to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands 


queen margaret

yes  i agree  and thank you for your motion 
son edward  she is fair and virtuous 
therefore delay not  give thy hand to warwick 
and  with thy hand  thy faith irrevocable 
that only warwick daughter shall be thine 


prince edward

yes  i accept her  for she well deserves it 
and here  to pledge my vow  i give my hand 
he gives his hand to warwick


king lewis xi

why stay we now  these soldiers shall be levied 
and thou  lord bourbon  our high admiral 
shalt waft them over with our royal fleet 
i long till edward fall by war mischance 
for mocking marriage with a dame of france 
exeunt all but warwick


warwick

i came from edward as ambassador 
but i return his sworn and mortal foe 
matter of marriage was the charge he gave me 
but dreadful war shall answer his demand 
had he none else to make a stale but me 
then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow 
i was the chief that raised him to the crown 
and i be chief to bring him down again 
not that i pity henry misery 
but seek revenge on edward mockery
