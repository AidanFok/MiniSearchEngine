scene i  london  the palace 


enter gloucester  clarence  somerset  and montague


gloucester

now tell me  brother clarence  what think you
of this new marriage with the lady grey 
hath not our brother made a worthy choice 


clarence

alas  you know   far from hence to france 
how could he stay till warwick made return 


somerset

my lords  forbear this talk  here comes the king 


gloucester

and his well chosen bride 


clarence

i mind to tell him plainly what i think 
flourish  enter king edward iv  attended  queen elizabeth  pembroke  stafford  hastings  and others


king edward iv

now  brother of clarence  how like you our choice 
that you stand pensive  as half malcontent 


clarence

as well as lewis of france  or the earl of warwick 
which are so weak of courage and in judgment
that they take no offence at our abuse 


king edward iv

suppose they take offence without a cause 
they are but lewis and warwick  i am edward 
your king and warwick s  and must have my will 


gloucester

and shall have your will  because our king 
yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well 


king edward iv

yea  brother richard  are you offended too 


gloucester

not i 
no  god forbid that i should wish them sever 
whom god hath join together  ay  and  pity
to sunder them that yoke so well together 


king edward iv

setting your scorns and your mislike aside 
tell me some reason why the lady grey
should not become my wife and england queen 
and you too  somerset and montague 
speak freely what you think 


clarence

then this is mine opinion  that king lewis
becomes your enemy  for mocking him
about the marriage of the lady bona 


gloucester

and warwick  doing what you gave in charge 
is now dishonoured by this new marriage 


king edward iv

what if both lewis and warwick be appeased
by such invention as i can devise 


montague

yet  to have join with france in such alliance
would more have strengthen this our commonwealth
 foreign storms than any home bred marriage 


hastings

why  knows not montague that of itself
england is safe  if true within itself 


montague

but the safer when  back with france 


hastings

 better using france than trusting france 
let us be back with god and with the seas
which he hath given for fence impregnable 
and with their helps only defend ourselves 
in them and in ourselves our safety lies 


clarence

for this one speech lord hastings well deserves
to have the heir of the lord hungerford 


king edward iv

ay  what of that  it was my will and grant 
and for this once my will shall stand for law 


gloucester

and yet methinks your grace hath not done well 
to give the heir and daughter of lord scales
unto the brother of your loving bride 
she better would have fitted me or clarence 
but in your bride you bury brotherhood 


clarence

or else you would not have bestow the heir
of the lord bonville on your new wife son 
and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere 


king edward iv

alas  poor clarence  is it for a wife
that thou art malcontent  i will provide thee 


clarence

in choosing for yourself  you show your judgment 
which being shallow  you give me leave
to play the broker in mine own behalf 
and to that end i shortly mind to leave you 


king edward iv

leave me  or tarry  edward will be king 
and not be tied unto his brother will 


queen elizabeth

my lords  before it pleased his majesty
to raise my state to title of a queen 
do me but right  and you must all confess
that i was not ignoble of descent 
and meaner than myself have had like fortune 
but as this title honours me and mine 
so your dislike  to whom i would be pleasing 
doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow 


king edward iv

my love  forbear to fawn upon their frowns 
what danger or what sorrow can befall thee 
so long as edward is thy constant friend 
and their true sovereign  whom they must obey 
nay  whom they shall obey  and love thee too 
unless they seek for hatred at my hands 
which if they do  yet will i keep thee safe 
and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath 


gloucester

 aside   i hear  yet say not much  but think the more 
enter a post


king edward iv

now  messenger  what letters or what news
from france 


post

my sovereign liege  no letters  and few words 
but such as i  without your special pardon 
dare not relate 


king edward iv

go to  we pardon thee  therefore  in brief 
tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them 
what answer makes king lewis unto our letters 


post

at my depart  these were his very words 
 tell false edward  thy supposed king 
that lewis of france is sending over masquers
to revel it with him and his new bride 


king edward iv

is lewis so brave  belike he thinks me henry 
but what said lady bona to my marriage 


post

these were her words  utter with mad disdain 
 him  in hope he prove a widower shortly 
i wear the willow garland for his sake 


king edward iv

i blame not her  she could say little less 
she had the wrong  but what said henry queen 
for i have heard that she was there in place 


post

 him  quoth she   mourning weeds are done 
and i am ready to put armour on 


king edward iv

belike she minds to play the amazon 
but what said warwick to these injuries 


post

he  more incensed against your majesty
than all the rest  discharged me with these words 
 him from me that he hath done me wrong 
and therefore i uncrown him ere be long 


king edward iv

ha  durst the traitor breathe out so proud words 
well i will arm me  being thus forewarn d 
they shall have wars and pay for their presumption 
but say  is warwick friends with margaret 


post

ay  gracious sovereign  they are so link in
friendship
that young prince edward marries warwick daughter 


clarence

belike the elder  clarence will have the younger 
now  brother king  farewell  and sit you fast 
for i will hence to warwick other daughter 
that  though i want a kingdom  yet in marriage
i may not prove inferior to yourself 
you that love me and warwick  follow me 
exit clarence  and somerset follows


gloucester

 aside   not i 
my thoughts aim at a further matter  i
stay not for the love of edward  but the crown 


king edward iv

clarence and somerset both gone to warwick 
yet am i arm against the worst can happen 
and haste is needful in this desperate case 
pembroke and stafford  you in our behalf
go levy men  and make prepare for war 
they are already  or quickly will be landed 
myself in person will straight follow you 
exeunt pembroke and stafford
but  ere i go  hastings and montague 
resolve my doubt  you twain  of all the rest 
are near to warwick by blood and by alliance 
tell me if you love warwick more than me 
if it be so  then both depart to him 
i rather wish you foes than hollow friends 
but if you mind to hold your true obedience 
give me assurance with some friendly vow 
that i may never have you in suspect 


montague

so god help montague as he proves true 


hastings

and hastings as he favours edward cause 


king edward iv

now  brother richard  will you stand by us 


gloucester

ay  in despite of all that shall withstand you 


king edward iv

why  so  then am i sure of victory 
now therefore let us hence  and lose no hour 
till we meet warwick with his foreign power 
exeunt
