scene ii  a plain in warwickshire 


enter warwick and oxford  with french soldiers


warwick

trust me  my lord  all hitherto goes well 
the common people by numbers swarm to us 
enter clarence and somerset
but see where somerset and clarence come 
speak suddenly  my lords  are we all friends 


clarence

fear not that  my lord 


warwick

then  gentle clarence  welcome unto warwick 
and welcome  somerset  i hold it cowardice
to rest mistrustful where a noble heart
hath pawn an open hand in sign of love 
else might i think that clarence  edward brother 
were but a feigned friend to our proceedings 
but welcome  sweet clarence  my daughter shall be thine 
and now what rests but  in night coverture 
thy brother being carelessly encamp d 
his soldiers lurking in the towns about 
and but attended by a simple guard 
we may surprise and take him at our pleasure 
our scouts have found the adventure very easy 
that as ulysses and stout diomede
with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus  tents 
and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds 
so we  well cover with the night black mantle 
at unawares may beat down edward guard
and seize himself  i say not  slaughter him 
for i intend but only to surprise him 
you that will follow me to this attempt 
applaud the name of henry with your leader 
they all cry   henry 
why  then  let on our way in silent sort 
for warwick and his friends  god and saint george
