second watchman

 the more honour  because more dangerous 


third watchman

ay  but give me worship and quietness 
i like it better than a dangerous honour 
if warwick knew in what estate he stands 
 to be doubted he would waken him 


first watchman

unless our halberds did shut up his passage 


second watchman

ay  wherefore else guard we his royal tent 
but to defend his person from night foes 
enter warwick  clarence  oxford  somerset  and french soldiers  silent all

warwick

ay  but the case is alter d 
when you disgraced me in my embassade 
then i degraded you from being king 
and come now to create you duke of york 
alas  how should you govern any kingdom 
that know not how to use ambassadors 
nor how to be contented with one wife 
nor how to use your brothers brotherly 
nor how to study for the people welfare 
nor how to shroud yourself from enemies 


king edward iv

yea  brother of clarence  are thou here too 
nay  then i see that edward needs must down 
yet  warwick  in despite of all mischance 
of thee thyself and all thy complices 
edward will always bear himself as king 
though fortune malice overthrow my state 
my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel 


warwick

then  for his mind  be edward england king 
takes off his crown
but henry now shall wear the english crown 
and be true king indeed  thou but the shadow 
my lord of somerset  at my request

unto my brother  archbishop of york 
when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows 
i follow you  and tell what answer
lewis and the lady bona send to him 
now  for a while farewell  good duke of york 
they lead him out forcibly


king edward iv

what fates impose  that men must needs abide 
it boots not to resist both wind and tide 
exit  guarded

but march to london with our soldiers

to free king henry from imprisonment
and see him seated in the regal throne
