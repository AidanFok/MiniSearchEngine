scene iv  london  the palace 


enter queen elizabeth and rivers


rivers

madam  what makes you in this sudden change 


queen elizabeth

why brother rivers  are you yet to learn
what late misfortune is befall king edward 


rivers

what  loss of some pitch battle against warwick 


queen elizabeth

no  but the loss of his own royal person 


rivers

then is my sovereign slain 


queen elizabeth

ay  almost slain  for he is taken prisoner 
either betray by falsehood of his guard
or by his foe surprised at unawares 
and  as i further have to understand 
is new committed to the bishop of york 
fell warwick brother and by that our foe 


rivers

these news i must confess are full of grief 
yet  gracious madam  bear it as you may 
warwick may lose  that now hath won the day 


queen elizabeth

till then fair hope must hinder life decay 
and i the rather wean me from despair
for love of edward offspring in my womb 
this is it that makes me bridle passion
and bear with mildness my misfortune cross 
ay  ay  for this i draw in many a tear
and stop the rising of blood sucking sighs 
lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown
king edward fruit  true heir to the english crown 


rivers

but  madam  where is warwick then become 


queen elizabeth

i am inform that he comes towards london 
to set the crown once more on henry head 
guess thou the rest  king edward friends must down 
but  to prevent the tyrant violence 
for trust not him that hath once broken faith 
i hence forthwith unto the sanctuary 
to save at least the heir of edward right 
there shall i rest secure from force and fraud 
come  therefore  let us fly while we may fly 
if warwick take us we are sure to die 
exeunt
