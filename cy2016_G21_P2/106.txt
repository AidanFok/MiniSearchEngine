scene v  a park near middleham castle in yorkshire 


enter gloucester  hastings  and stanley


gloucester

now  my lord hastings and sir william stanley 
leave off to wonder why i drew you hither 
into this chiefest thicket of the park 
thus stands the case  you know our king  my brother 
is prisoner to the bishop here  at whose hands
he hath good usage and great liberty 
and  often but attended with weak guard 
comes hunting this way to disport himself 
i have advertised him by secret means
that if about this hour he make his way
under the colour of his usual game 
he shall here find his friends with horse and men
to set him free from his captivity 
enter king edward iv and a huntsman with him


huntsman

this way  my lord  for this way lies the game 


king edward iv

nay  this way  man  see where the huntsmen stand 
now  brother of gloucester  lord hastings  and the rest 
stand you thus close  to steal the bishop deer 


gloucester

brother  the time and case requireth haste 
your horse stands ready at the park corner 


king edward iv

but whither shall we then 


hastings

to lynn  my lord 
and ship from thence to flanders 


gloucester

well guess d  believe me  for that was my meaning 


king edward iv

stanley  i will requite thy forwardness 


gloucester

but wherefore stay we   no time to talk 


king edward iv

huntsman  what say thou  wilt thou go along 


huntsman

better do so than tarry and be hang d 


gloucester

come then  away  let ha  no more ado 


king edward iv

bishop  farewell  shield thee from warwick frown 
and pray that i may repossess the crown 
exeunt
