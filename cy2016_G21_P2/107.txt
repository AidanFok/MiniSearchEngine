scene vi  london  the tower 


flourish  enter king henry vi  clarence  warwick   somerset  henry of richmond  oxford  montague  and lieutenant of the tower


king henry vi

master lieutenant  now that god and friends
have shaken edward from the regal seat 
and turn my captive state to liberty 
my fear to hope  my sorrows unto joys 
at our enlargement what are thy due fees 


lieutenant

subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns 
but if an humble prayer may prevail 
i then crave pardon of your majesty 


king henry vi

for what  lieutenant  for well using me 
nay  be thou sure i well requite thy kindness 
for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure 
ay  such a pleasure as incaged birds
conceive when after many moody thoughts
at last by notes of household harmony
they quite forget their loss of liberty 
but  warwick  after god  thou set me free 
and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee 
he was the author  thou the instrument 
therefore  that i may conquer fortune spite
by living low  where fortune cannot hurt me 
and that the people of this blessed land
may not be punish with my thwarting stars 
warwick  although my head still wear the crown 
i here resign my government to thee 
for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds 


warwick

your grace hath still been famed for virtuous 
and now may seem as wise as virtuous 
by spying and avoiding fortune malice 
for few men rightly temper with the stars 
yet in this one thing let me blame your grace 
for choosing me when clarence is in place 


clarence

no  warwick  thou art worthy of the sway 
to whom the heavens in thy nativity
adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown 
as likely to be blest in peace and war 
and therefore i yield thee my free consent 


warwick

and i choose clarence only for protector 


king henry vi

warwick and clarence give me both your hands 
now join your hands  and with your hands your hearts 
that no dissension hinder government 
i make you both protectors of this land 
while i myself will lead a private life
and in devotion spend my latter days 
to sin rebuke and my creator praise 


warwick

what answers clarence to his sovereign will 


clarence

that he consents  if warwick yield consent 
for on thy fortune i repose myself 


warwick

why  then  though loath  yet must i be content 
we yoke together  like a double shadow
to henry body  and supply his place 
i mean  in bearing weight of government 
while he enjoys the honour and his ease 
and  clarence  now then it is more than needful
forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor 
and all his lands and goods be confiscate 


clarence

what else  and that succession be determined 


warwick

ay  therein clarence shall not want his part 


king henry vi

but  with the first of all your chief affairs 
let me entreat  for i command no more 
that margaret your queen and my son edward
be sent for  to return from france with speed 
for  till i see them here  by doubtful fear
my joy of liberty is half eclipsed 


clarence

it shall be done  my sovereign  with all speed 


king henry vi

my lord of somerset  what youth is that 
of whom you seem to have so tender care 


somerset

my liege  it is young henry  earl of richmond 


king henry vi

come hither  england hope 
lays his hand on his head
if secret powers
suggest but truth to my divining thoughts 
this pretty lad will prove our country bliss 
his looks are full of peaceful majesty 
his head by nature framed to wear a crown 
his hand to wield a sceptre  and himself
likely in time to bless a regal throne 
make much of him  my lords  for this is he
must help you more than you are hurt by me 
enter a post


warwick

what news  my friend 


post

that edward is escaped from your brother 
and fled  as he hears since  to burgundy 


warwick

unsavoury news  but how made he escape 


post

he was convey by richard duke of gloucester
and the lord hastings  who attended him
in secret ambush on the forest side
and from the bishop huntsmen rescued him 
for hunting was his daily exercise 


warwick

my brother was too careless of his charge 
but let us hence  my sovereign  to provide
a salve for any sore that may betide 
exeunt all but somerset  henry of richmond  and oxford


somerset

my lord  i like not of this flight of edward s 
for doubtless burgundy will yield him help 
and we shall have more wars before  be long 
as henry late presaging prophecy
did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond 
so doth my heart misgive me  in these conflicts
what may befall him  to his harm and ours 
therefore  lord oxford  to prevent the worst 
forthwith we send him hence to brittany 
till storms be past of civil enmity 


oxford

ay  for if edward repossess the crown 
 like that richmond with the rest shall down 


somerset

it shall be so  he shall to brittany 
come  therefore  let about it speedily 
exeunt
