scene vii  before york 


flourish  enter king edward iv  gloucester  hastings  and soldiers


king edward iv

now  brother richard  lord hastings  and the rest 
yet thus far fortune maketh us amends 
and says that once more i shall interchange
my waned state for henry regal crown 
well have we pass and now repass the seas
and brought desired help from burgundy 
what then remains  we being thus arrived
from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york 
but that we enter  as into our dukedom 


gloucester

the gates made fast  brother  i like not this 
for many men that stumble at the threshold
are well foretold that danger lurks within 


king edward iv

tush  man  abodements must not now affright us 
by fair or foul means we must enter in 
for hither will our friends repair to us 


hastings

my liege  i knock once more to summon them 
enter  on the walls  the mayor of york  and his brethren


mayor

my lords  we were forewarned of your coming 
and shut the gates for safety of ourselves 
for now we owe allegiance unto henry 


king edward iv

but  master mayor  if henry be your king 
yet edward at the least is duke of york 


mayor

true  my good lord  i know you for no less 


king edward iv

why  and i challenge nothing but my dukedom 
as being well content with that alone 


gloucester

 aside   but when the fox hath once got in his nose 
he soon find means to make the body follow 


hastings

why  master mayor  why stand you in a doubt 
open the gates  we are king henry friends 


mayor

ay  say you so  the gates shall then be open d 
they descend


gloucester

a wise stout captain  and soon persuaded 


hastings

the good old man would fain that all were well 
so  not  of him  but being enter d 
i doubt not  i  but we shall soon persuade
both him and all his brothers unto reason 
enter the mayor and two aldermen  below


king edward iv

so  master mayor  these gates must not be shut
but in the night or in the time of war 
what  fear not  man  but yield me up the keys 
takes his keys
for edward will defend the town and thee 
and all those friends that deign to follow me 
march  enter montgomery  with drum and soldiers


gloucester

brother  this is sir john montgomery 
our trusty friend  unless i be deceived 


king edward iv

welcome  sir john  but why come you in arms 


montague

to help king edward in his time of storm 
as every loyal subject ought to do 


king edward iv

thanks  good montgomery  but we now forget
our title to the crown and only claim
our dukedom till god please to send the rest 


montague

then fare you well  for i will hence again 
i came to serve a king and not a duke 
drummer  strike up  and let us march away 
the drum begins to march


king edward iv

nay  stay  sir john  awhi le  and we debate
by what safe means the crown may be recover d 


montague

what talk you of debating  in few words 
if you not here proclaim yourself our king 
i leave you to your fortune and be gone
to keep them back that come to succor you 
why shall we fight  if you pretend no title 


gloucester

why  brother  wherefore stand you on nice points 


king edward iv

when we grow stronger  then we make our claim 
till then   wisdom to conceal our meaning 


hastings

away with scrupulous wit  now arms must rule 


gloucester

and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns 
brother  we will proclaim you out of hand 
the bruit thereof will bring you many friends 


king edward iv

then be it as you will  for  my right 
and henry but usurps the diadem 


montague

ay  now my sovereign speaketh like himself 
and now will i be edward champion 


hastings

sound trumpet  edward shall be here proclaim d 
come  fellow soldier  make thou proclamation 
flourish


soldier

edward the fourth  by the grace of god  king of
england and france  and lord of ireland     c 


montague

and whosoe gainsays king edward right 
by this i challenge him to single fight 
throws down his gauntlet


all

long live edward the fourth 


king edward iv

thanks  brave montgomery  and thanks unto you all 
if fortune serve me  i requite this kindness 
now  for this night  let harbour here in york 
and when the morning sun shall raise his car
above the border of this horizon 
we forward towards warwick and his mates 
for well i wot that henry is no soldier 
ah  froward clarence  how evil it beseems thee
to flatter henry and forsake thy brother 
yet  as we may  we meet both thee and warwick 
come on  brave soldiers  doubt not of the day 
and  that once gotten  doubt not of large pay 
exeunt
