flourish  enter king henry vi  warwick  montague  clarence  exeter  and oxford


warwick

what counsel  lords  edward from belgia 
with hasty germans and blunt hollanders 
hath pass in safety through the narrow seas 
and with his troops doth march amain to london 
and many giddy people flock to him 


king henry vi

let levy men  and beat him back again 


clarence

a little fire is quickly trodden out 
which  being suffer d  rivers cannot quench 


warwick

in warwickshire i have true hearted friends 
not mutinous in peace  yet bold in war 
those will i muster up  and thou  son clarence 
shalt stir up in suffolk  norfolk  and in kent 
the knights and gentlemen to come with thee 
thou  brother montague  in buckingham 
northampton and in leicestershire  shalt find
men well inclined to hear what thou command st 
and thou  brave oxford  wondrous well beloved 
in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends 
my sovereign  with the loving citizens 
like to his island girt in with the ocean 
or modest dian circled with her nymphs 
shall rest in london till we come to him 
fair lords  take leave and stand not to reply 
farewell  my sovereign 


king henry vi

farewell  my hector  and my troy true hope 


clarence

in sign of truth  i kiss your highness  hand 


king henry vi

well minded clarence  be thou fortunate 


montague

comfort  my lord  and so i take my leave 


oxford

and thus i seal my truth  and bid adieu 


king henry vi

sweet oxford  and my loving montague 
and all at once  once more a happy farewell 


warwick

farewell  sweet lords  let meet at coventry 
exeunt all but king henry vi and exeter


king henry vi

here at the palace i will rest awhile 
cousin of exeter  what thinks your lordship 
methinks the power that edward hath in field
should not be able to encounter mine 


exeter

the doubt is that he will seduce the rest 


king henry vi

that not my fear  my meed hath got me fame 
i have not stopp mine ears to their demands 
nor posted off their suits with slow delays 
my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds 
my mildness hath allay their swelling griefs 
my mercy dried their water flowing tears 
i have not been desirous of their wealth 
nor much oppress them with great subsidies 
nor forward of revenge  though they much err d 
then why should they love edward more than me 
no  exeter  these graces challenge grace 
and when the lion fawns upon the lamb 
the lamb will never cease to follow him 
shout within   lancaster  a lancaster 


exeter

hark  hark  my lord  what shouts are these 
enter king edward iv  gloucester  and soldiers


king edward iv

seize on the shame faced henry  bear him hence 
and once again proclaim us king of england 
you are the fount that makes small brooks to flow 
now stops thy spring  my sea sha l suck them dry 
and swell so much the higher by their ebb 
hence with him to the tower  let him not speak 
exeunt some with king henry vi
and  lords  towards coventry bend we our course
where peremptory warwick now remains 
the sun shines hot  and  if we use delay 
cold biting winter mars our hoped for hay 


gloucester

away betimes  before his forces join 
and take the great grown traitor unawares 
brave warriors  march amain towards coventry 
exeunt
