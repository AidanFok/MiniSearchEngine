and i dare well maintain it with my life 
if well respected honour bid me on 
i hold as little counsel with weak fear
as you  my lord  or any scot that this day lives 
let it be seen to morrow in the battle
which of us fears

hotspur

to night  say i 


vernon

come  come it nay not be  i wonder much 
being men of such great leading as you are 
that you foresee not what impediments
drag back our expedition  certain horse
of my cousin vernon are not yet come up 
your uncle worcester horse came but today 
and now their pride and mettle is asleep 
their courage with hard labour tame and dull 
that not a horse is half the half of himself 


hotspur

so are the horses of the enemy
in general  journey bated and brought low 
the better part of ours are full of rest 


earl of worcester

the number of the king exceedeth ours 
for god sake  cousin  stay till all come in 
the trumpet sounds a parley
enter sir walter blunt


sir walter blunt

i come with gracious offers from the king 
if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect 


hotspur

welcome  sir walter blunt  and would to god
you were of our determination 
some of us love you well  and even those some
envy your great deservings and good name 
because you are not of our quality 
but stand against us like an enemy 


sir walter blunt

and god defend but still i should stand so 
so long as out of limit and true rule
you stand against anointed majesty 
but to my charge  the king hath sent to know
the nature of your griefs  and whereupon
you conjure from the breast of civil peace
such bold hostility  teaching his duteous land
audacious cruelty  if that the king
have any way your good deserts forgot 
which he confesseth to be manifold 
he bids you name your griefs  and with all speed
you shall have your desires with interest
and pardon absolute for yourself and these
herein misled by your suggestion 


hotspur

the king is kind  and well we know the king
knows at what time to promise  when to pay 
my father and my uncle and myself
did give him that same royalty he wears 
and when he was not six and twenty strong 
sick in the world regard  wretched and low 
a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home 
my father gave him welcome to the shore 
and when he heard him swear and vow to god
he came but to be duke of lancaster 
to sue his livery and beg his peace 
with tears of innocency and terms of zeal 
my father  in kind heart and pity moved 
swore him assistance and perform it too 
now when the lords and barons of the realm
perceived northumberland did lean to him 
the more and less came in with cap and knee 
met him in boroughs  cities  villages 
attended him on bridges  stood in lanes 
laid gifts before him  proffer him their oaths 
gave him their heirs  as pages follow him
even at the heels in golden multitudes 
he presently  as greatness knows itself 
steps me a little higher than his vow
made to my father  while his blood was poor 
upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh 
and now  forsooth  takes on him to reform
some certain edicts and some strait decrees
that lie too heavy on the commonwealth 
cries out upon abuses  seems to weep
over his country wrongs  and by this face 
this seeming brow of justice  did he win
the hearts of all that he did angle for 
proceeded further  cut me off the heads
of all the favourites that the absent king
in deputation left behind him here 
when he was personal in the irish war 


sir walter blunt

tut  i came not to hear this 


hotspur

then to the point 
in short time after  he deposed the king 
soon after that  deprived him of his life 
and in the neck of that  task the whole state 
to make that worse  suffer his kinsman march 
who is  if every owner were well placed 
indeed his king  to be engaged in wales 
there without ransom to lie forfeited 
disgraced me in my happy victories 
sought to entrap me by intelligence 
rated mine uncle from the council board 
in rage dismiss my father from the court 
broke oath on oath  committed wrong on wrong 
and in conclusion drove us to seek out
this head of safety  and withal to pry
into his title  the which we find
too indirect for long continuance 


sir walter blunt

shall i return this answer to the king 


hotspur

not so  sir walter  we withdraw awhile 
go to the king  and let there be impawn 
some surety for a safe return again 
and in the morning early shall my uncle
bring him our purposes  and so farewell 


sir walter blunt

i would you would accept of grace and love 


hotspur

and may be so we shall 


sir walter blunt

pray god you do 
exeunt
