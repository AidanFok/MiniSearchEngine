scene ii  a field of battle near barnet 


alarum and excursions  enter king edward iv  bringing	forth warwick wounded
king edward iv
so  lie thou there  die thou  and die our fear 
for warwick was a bug that fear us all 
now  montague  sit fast  i seek for thee 
that warwick bones may keep thine company 


exit
warwick
ah  who is nigh  come to me  friend or foe 
and tell me who is victor  york or warwick 
why ask i that  my mangled body shows 
my blood  my want of strength  my sick heart shows 
that i must yield my body to the earth
and  by my fall  the conquest to my foe 
thus yields the cedar to the axe edge 
whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle 
under whose shade the ramping lion slept 
whose top branch overpeer jove spreading tree
and kept low shrubs from winter powerful wind 
these eyes  that now are dimm with death black veil 
have been as piercing as the mid day sun 
to search the secret treasons of the world 
the wrinkles in my brows  now filled with blood 
were liken oft to kingly sepulchres 
for who lived king  but i could dig his grave 
and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow 
lo  now my glory smear in dust and blood 
my parks  my walks  my manors that i had 
even now forsake me  and of all my lands
is nothing left me but my body length 
why  what is pomp  rule  reign  but earth and dust 
and  live we how we can  yet die we must 


enter oxford and somerset
somerset
ah  warwick  warwick  wert thou as we are 
we might recover all our loss again 
the queen from france hath brought a puissant power 
even now we heard the news  ah  could thou fly 


warwick
why  then i would not fly  ah  montague 
if thou be there  sweet brother  take my hand 
and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile 
thou lovest me not  for  brother  if thou didst 
thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
that glues my lips and will not let me speak 
come quickly  montague  or i am dead 


somerset
ah  warwick  montague hath breathed his last 
and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick 
and said  me to my valiant brother 
and more he would have said  and more he spoke 
which sounded like a clamour in a vault 
that mought not be distinguished  but at last
i well might hear  delivered with a groan 
 o  farewell  warwick 


warwick
sweet rest his soul  fly  lords  and save yourselves 
for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven 


dies
oxford
away  away  to meet the queen great power 

here they bear away his body  exeunt
