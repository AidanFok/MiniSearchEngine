flourish  enter king edward iv in triumph  with	gloucester  clarence  and the rest
king edward iv
thus far our fortune keeps an upward course 
and we are graced with wreaths of victory 
but  in the midst of this bright shining day 
i spy a black  suspicious  threatening cloud 
that will encounter with our glorious sun 
ere he attain his easeful western bed 
i mean  my lords  those powers that the queen
hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast
and  as we hear  march on to fight with us 


clarence
a little gale will soon disperse that cloud
and blow it to the source from whence it came 
the very beams will dry those vapours up 
for every cloud engenders not a storm 


gloucester
the queen is valued thirty thousand strong 
and somerset  with oxford fled to her 
if she have time to breathe be well assured
her faction will be full as strong as ours 


king edward iv
we are advertised by our loving friends
that they do hold their course toward tewksbury 
we  having now the best at barnet field 
will thither straight  for willingness rids way 
and  as we march  our strength will be augmented
in every county as we go along 
strike up the drum  cry  courage  and away
