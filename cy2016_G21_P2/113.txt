march  enter queen margaret  prince edward 	somerset  oxford  and soldiers
queen margaret
great lords  wise men ne sit and wail their loss 
but cheerly seek how to redress their harms 
what though the mast be now blown overboard 
the cable broke  the holding anchor lost 
and half our sailors swallow in the flood 
yet lives our pilot still  is meet that he
should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
with tearful eyes add water to the sea
and give more strength to that which hath too much 
whiles  in his moan  the ship splits on the rock 
which industry and courage might have saved 
ah  what a shame  ah  what a fault were this 
say warwick was our anchor  what of that 
and montague our topmost  what of him 
our slaughter friends the tackles  what of these 
why  is not oxford here another anchor 
and somerset another goodly mast 
the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings 
and  though unskilful  why not ned and i
for once allow the skilful pilot charge 
we will not from the helm to sit and weep 
but keep our course  though the rough wind say no 
from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck 
as good to chide the waves as speak them fair 
and what is edward but ruthless sea 
what clarence but a quicksand of deceit 
and richard but a ragged fatal rock 
all these the enemies to our poor bark 
say you can swim  alas   but a while 
tread on the sand  why  there you quickly sink 
bestride the rock  the tide will wash you off 
or else you famish  that a threefold death 
this speak i  lords  to let you understand 
if case some one of you would fly from us 
that there no hoped for mercy with the brothers
more than with ruthless waves  with sands and rocks 
why  courage then  what cannot be avoided
 childish weakness to lament or fear 


prince edward
methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
should  if a coward heard her speak these words 
infuse his breast with magnanimity
and make him  naked  foil a man at arms 
i speak not this as doubting any here
for did i but suspect a fearful man
he should have leave to go away betimes 
lest in our need he might infect another
and make him of like spirit to himself 
if any such be here as god forbid 
let him depart before we need his help 


oxford
women and children of so high a courage 
and warriors faint  why   perpetual shame 
o brave young prince  thy famous grandfather
doth live again in thee  long mayst thou live
to bear his image and renew his glories 


somerset
and he that will not fight for such a hope 
go home to bed  and like the owl by day 
if he arise  be mock and wonder at 


queen margaret
thanks  gentle somerset  sweet oxford  thanks 

prince edward
and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else 

enter a messenger
messenger
prepare you  lords  for edward is at hand 
ready to fight  therefore be resolute 


oxford
i thought no less  it is his policy
to haste thus fast  to find us unprovided 


somerset
but he deceived  we are in readiness 

queen margaret
this cheers my heart  to see your forwardness 

oxford
here pitch our battle  hence we will not budge 

flourish and march  enter king edward iv  gloucester 	clarence  and soldiers
king edward iv
brave followers  yonder stands the thorny wood 
which  by the heavens  assistance and your strength 
must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night 
i need not add more fuel to your fire 
for well i wot ye blaze to burn them out
give signal to the fight  and to it  lords 


queen margaret
lords  knights  and gentlemen  what i should say
my tears gainsay  for every word i speak 
ye see  i drink the water of mine eyes 
therefore  no more but this  henry  your sovereign 
is prisoner to the foe  his state usurp d 
his realm a slaughter house  his subjects slain 
his statutes cancell and his treasure spent 
and yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil 
you fight in justice  then  in god name  lords 
be valiant and give signal to the fight
