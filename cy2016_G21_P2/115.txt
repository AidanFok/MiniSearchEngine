scene vi  london  the tower 

enter king henry vi and gloucester  with the	lieutenant  on the walls
gloucester
good day  my lord  what  at your book so hard 

king henry vi
ay  my good lord my lord  i should say rather 
 sin to flatter   good  was little better 
 gloucester  and  devil  were alike 
and both preposterous  therefore  not  lord 


gloucester
sirrah  leave us to ourselves  we must confer 

exit lieutenant
king henry vi
so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf 
so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
and next his throat unto the butcher knife 
what scene of death hath roscius now to act 


gloucester
suspicion always haunts the guilty mind 
the thief doth fear each bush an officer 


king henry vi
the bird that hath been limed in a bush 
with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush 
and i  the hapless male to one sweet bird 
have now the fatal object in my eye
where my poor young was limed  was caught and kill d 


gloucester
why  what a peevish fool was that of crete 
that taught his son the office of a fowl 
an yet  for all his wings  the fool was drown d 


king henry vi
i  daedalus  my poor boy  icarus 
thy father  minos  that denied our course 
the sun that sear the wings of my sweet boy
thy brother edward  and thyself the sea
whose envious gulf did swallow up his life 
ah  kill me with thy weapon  not with words 
my breast can better brook thy dagger point
than can my ears that tragic history 
but wherefore dost thou come  is for my life 


gloucester
think thou i am an executioner 

king henry vi
a persecutor  i am sure  thou art 
if murdering innocents be executing 
why  then thou art an executioner 


gloucester
thy son i kill for his presumption 

king henry vi
hadst thou been kill when first thou didst presume 
thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine 
and thus i prophesy  that many a thousand 
which now mistrust no parcel of my fear 
and many an old man sigh and many a widow s 
and many an orphan water standing eye 
men for their sons  wives for their husbands 
and orphans for their parents timeless death 
shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born 
the owl shriek at thy birth an evil sign 
the night crow cried  aboding luckless time 
dogs howl d  and hideous tempest shook down trees 
the raven rook her on the chimney top 
and chattering pies in dismal discords sung 
thy mother felt more than a mother pain 
and  yet brought forth less than a mother hope 
to wit  an indigested and deformed lump 
not like the fruit of such a goodly tree 
teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born 
to signify thou camest to bite the world 
and  if the rest be true which i have heard 
thou camest 


gloucester
i hear no more  die  prophet in thy speech 

stabs him

for this amongst the rest  was i ordain d 


king henry vi
ay  and for much more slaughter after this 
god forgive my sins  and pardon thee 


dies
gloucester
what  will the aspiring blood of lancaster
sink in the ground  i thought it would have mounted 
see how my sword weeps for the poor king death 
o  may such purple tears be alway shed
from those that wish the downfall of our house 
if any spark of life be yet remaining 
down  down to hell  and say i sent thee thither 


stabs him again

i  that have neither pity  love  nor fear 
indeed   true that henry told me of 
for i have often heard my mother say
i came into the world with my legs forward 
had i not reason  think ye  to make haste 
and seek their ruin that usurp our right 
the midwife wonder and the women cried
 o  jesus bless us  he is born with teeth 
and so i was  which plainly signified
that i should snarl and bite and play the dog 
then  since the heavens have shaped my body so 
let hell make crook my mind to answer it 
i have no brother  i am like no brother 
and this word  love  which graybeards call divine 
be resident in men like one another
and not in me  i am myself alone 
clarence  beware  thou keep me from the light 
but i will sort a pitchy day for thee 
for i will buz abroad such prophecies
that edward shall be fearful of his life 
and then  to purge his fear  i be thy death 
king henry and the prince his son are gone 
clarence  thy turn is next  and then the rest 
counting myself but bad till i be best 
i throw thy body in another room
and triumph  henry  in thy day of doom 


exit  with the body
