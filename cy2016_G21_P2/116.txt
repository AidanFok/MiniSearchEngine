king edward iv
once more we sit in england royal throne 
re purchased with the blood of enemies 
what valiant foemen  like to autumn corn 
have we mow down  in tops of all their pride 
three dukes of somerset  threefold renown 
for hardy and undoubted champions 
two cliffords  as the father and the son 
and two northumberlands  two braver men
ne spurr their coursers at the trumpet sound 
with them  the two brave bears  warwick and montague 
that in their chains fetter the kingly lion
and made the forest tremble when they roar d 
thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
and made our footstool of security 
come hither  bess  and let me kiss my boy 
young ned  for thee  thine uncles and myself
have in our armours watch the winter night 
went all afoot in summer scalding heat 
that thou mightst repossess the crown in peace 
and of our labours thou shalt reap the gain 


gloucester
 aside   i blast his harvest  if your head were laid 
for yet i am not look on in the world 
this shoulder was ordain so thick to heave 
and heave it shall some weight  or break my back 
work thou the way and thou shalt execute 


king edward iv
clarence and gloucester  love my lovely queen 
and kiss your princely nephew  brothers both 


clarence
the duty that i owe unto your majesty
i seal upon the lips of this sweet babe 


queen elizabeth
thanks  noble clarence  worthy brother  thanks 

gloucester
and  that i love the tree from whence thou sprang st 
witness the loving kiss i give the fruit 
	 aside   to say the truth  so judas kiss his master 
and cried  hail  when as he meant all harm 


king edward iv
now am i seated as my soul delights 
having my country peace and brothers  loves 


clarence
what will your grace have done with margaret 
reignier  her father  to the king of france
hath pawn the sicils and jerusalem 
and hither have they sent it for her ransom 


king edward iv
away with her  and waft her hence to france 
and now what rests but that we spend the time
with stately triumphs  mirthful comic shows 
such as befits the pleasure of the court 
sound drums and trumpets  farewell sour annoy 
for here  i hope  begins our lasting joy
