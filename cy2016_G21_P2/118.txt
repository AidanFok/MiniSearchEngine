scene ii  paris  the king palace 


flourish of cornets  enter the king of france  with letters  and divers attendants


king

the florentines and senoys are by the ears 
have fought with equal fortune and continue
a braving war 


first lord

                  so  reported  sir 


king

nay   most credible  we here received it
a certainty  vouch from our cousin austria 
with caution that the florentine will move us
for speedy aid  wherein our dearest friend
prejudicates the business and would seem
to have us make denial 


first lord

his love and wisdom 
approved so to your majesty  may plead
for amplest credence 


king

he hath arm our answer 
and florence is denied before he comes 
yet  for our gentlemen that mean to see
the tuscan service  freely have they leave
to stand on either part 


second lord

it well may serve
a nursery to our gentry  who are sick
for breathing and exploit 


king

what he comes here 
enter bertram  lafeu  and parolles


first lord

it is the count rousillon  my good lord 
young bertram 


king

                  youth  thou bear thy father face 
frank nature  rather curious than in haste 
hath well composed thee  thy father moral parts
mayst thou inherit too  welcome to paris 


bertram

my thanks and duty are your majesty s 


king

i would i had that corporal soundness now 
as when thy father and myself in friendship
first tried our soldiership  he did look far
into the service of the time and was
discipled of the bravest  he lasted long 
but on us both did haggish age steal on
and wore us out of act  it much repairs me
to talk of your good father  in his youth
he had the wit which i can well observe
to day in our young lords  but they may jest
till their own scorn return to them unnoted
ere they can hide their levity in honour 
so like a courtier  contempt nor bitterness
were in his pride or sharpness  if they were 
his equal had awaked them  and his honour 
clock to itself  knew the true minute when
exception bid him speak  and at this time
his tongue obey his hand  who were below him
he used as creatures of another place
and bow his eminent top to their low ranks 
making them proud of his humility 
in their poor praise he humbled  such a man
might be a copy to these younger times 
which  follow well  would demonstrate them now
but goers backward 


bertram

his good remembrance  sir 
lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb 
so in approof lives not his epitaph
as in your royal speech 


king

would i were with him  he would always say 
methinks i hear him now  his plausive words
he scatter not in ears  but grafted them 
to grow there and to bear me not live 
this his good melancholy oft began 
on the catastrophe and heel of pastime 
when it was out me not live  quoth he 
 my flame lacks oil  to be the snuff
of younger spirits  whose apprehensive senses
all but new things disdain  whose judgments are
mere fathers of their garments  whose constancies
expire before their fashions  this he wish d 
i after him do after him wish too 
since i nor wax nor honey can bring home 
i quickly were dissolved from my hive 
to give some labourers room 


second lord

you are loved  sir 
they that least lend it you shall lack you first 


king

i fill a place  i know t  how long is t  count 
since the physician at your father died 
he was much famed 


bertram

                  some six months since  my lord 


king

if he were living  i would try him yet 
lend me an arm  the rest have worn me out
with several applications  nature and sickness
debate it at their leisure  welcome  count 
my son no dearer 


bertram

thank your majesty
