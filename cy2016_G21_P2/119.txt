steward

madam  the care i have had to even your content  i
wish might be found in the calendar of my past
endeavours  for then we wound our modesty and make
foul the clearness of our deservings  when of
ourselves we publish them 


countess

what does this knave here  get you gone  sirrah 
the complaints i have heard of you i do not all
believe   my slowness that i do not  for i know
you lack not folly to commit them  and have ability
enough to make such knaveries yours 


clown

countess

well  sir 


clown

many of the rich are damned  but  if i may have
your ladyship good will to go to the world  isbel
the woman and i will do as we may 


countess

wilt thou needs be a beggar 


clown

i do beg your good will in this case 


countess

in what case 


clown

in isbel case and mine own  service is no
heritage  and i think i shall never have the
blessing of god till i have issue o  my body  for
they say barnes are blessings 


countess

tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry 


clown

my poor body  madam  requires it  i am driven on
by the flesh  and he must needs go that the devil drives 


countess

is this all your worship reason 


clown

faith  madam  i have other holy reasons such as they
are 


countess

may the world know them 


clown

i have been  madam  a wicked creature  as you and
all flesh and blood are  and  indeed  i do marry
that i may repent 


countess

thy marriage  sooner than thy wickedness 


clown

i am out o  friends  madam  and i hope to have
friends for my wife sake 


countess

such friends are thine enemies  knave 


clown

you shallow  madam  in great friends  for the
knaves come to do that for me which i am aweary of 
he that ears my land spares my team and gives me
leave to in the crop  if i be his cuckold  he my
drudge  he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
of my flesh and blood  he that cherishes my flesh
and blood loves my flesh and blood  he that loves my
flesh and blood is my friend  ergo  he that kisses
my wife is my friend  if men could be contented to
be what they are  there were no fear in marriage 
for young charbon the puritan and old poysam the
papist  howsome their hearts are severed in
religion  their heads are both one  they may jowl
horns together  like any deer i  the herd 


countess

wilt thou ever be a foul mouthed and calumnious knave 


clown

a prophet i  madam  and i speak the truth the next
way 
for i the ballad will repeat 
which men full true shall find 
your marriage comes by destiny 
your cuckoo sings by kind 


countess

you  of her i am to speak 


countess

clown

     was this fair face the cause  quoth she 
why the grecians sacked troy 
fond done  done fond 
was this king priam joy 
with that she sighed as she stood 
with that she sighed as she stood 
and gave this sentence then 
among nine bad if one be good 
among nine bad if one be good 
there yet one good in ten 


countess

what  one good in ten  you corrupt the song  sirrah 


clown

one good woman in ten  madam  which is a purifying
o  the song  would god would serve the world so all
the year  we find no fault with the tithe woman 
if i were the parson  one in ten  quoth a  an we
might have a good woman born but one every blazing
star  or at an earthquake   mend the lottery
well  a man may draw his heart out  ere a  pluck
one 


countess

you be gone  sir knave  and do as i command you 


clown

that man should be at woman command  and yet no
hurt done  though honesty be no puritan  yet it
will do no hurt  it will wear the surplice of
humility over the black gown of a big heart  i am
going  forsooth  the business is for helen to come hither 
exit


countess

well  now 


steward

i know  madam  you love your gentlewoman entirely 


countess

faith  i do  her father bequeathed her to me  and
she herself  without other advantage  may lawfully
make title to as much love as she finds  there is
more owing her than is paid  and more shall be paid
her than she demand 


steward

madam  i was very late more near her than i think
she wished me  alone she was  and did communicate
to herself her own words to her own ears  she
thought  i dare vow for her  they touched not any
stranger sense  her matter was  she loved your son 
fortune  she said  was no goddess  that had put
such difference betwixt their two estates  love no
god  that would not extend his might  only where
qualities were level  dian no queen of virgins  that
would suffer her poor knight surprised  without
rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward 
this she delivered in the most bitter touch of
sorrow that e i heard virgin exclaim in  which i
held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal 
sithence  in the loss that may happen  it concerns
you something to know it 


countess

you have discharged this honestly  keep it to
yourself  many likelihoods informed me of this
before  which hung so tottering in the balance that
i could neither believe nor misdoubt  pray you 
leave me  stall this in your bosom  and i thank you
for your honest care  i will speak with you further anon 
exit steward
enter helena
even so it was with me when i was young 
if ever we are nature s  these are ours  this thorn
doth to our rose of youth rightly belong 
our blood to us  this to our blood is born 
it is the show and seal of nature truth 
where love strong passion is impress in youth 
by our remembrances of days foregone 
such were our faults  or then we thought them none 
her eye is sick on t  i observe her now 


helena

what is your pleasure  madam 


countess

you know  helen 
i am a mother to you 


helena

mine honourable mistress 


countess

nay  a mother 
why not a mother  when i said  mother 
methought you saw a serpent  what in  mother 
that you start at it  i say  i am your mother 
and put you in the catalogue of those
that were enwombed mine   often seen
adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
a native slip to us from foreign seeds 
you ne oppress me with a mother groan 
yet i express to you a mother care 
god mercy  maiden  does it curd thy blood
to say i am thy mother  what the matter 
that this distemper messenger of wet 
the many colour iris  rounds thine eye 
why  that you are my daughter 


helena

that i am not 


countess

i say  i am your mother 


helena

pardon  madam 
the count rousillon cannot be my brother 
i am from humble  he from honour name 
no note upon my parents  his all noble 
my master  my dear lord he is  and i
his servant live  and will his vassal die 
he must not be my brother 


countess

nor i your mother 


helena

you are my mother  madam  would you were 
so that my lord your son were not my brother 
indeed my mother  or were you both our mothers 
i care no more for than i do for heaven 
so i were not his sister  can no other 
but  i your daughter  he must be my brother 


countess

yes  helen  you might be my daughter in law 
god shield you mean it not  daughter and mother
so strive upon your pulse  what  pale again 
my fear hath catch your fondness  now i see
the mystery of your loneliness  and find
your salt tears  head  now to all sense  gross
you love my son  invention is ashamed 
against the proclamation of thy passion 
to say thou dost not  therefore tell me true 
but tell me then   so  for  look thy cheeks
confess it  th  one to th  other  and thine eyes
see it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
that in their kind they speak it  only sin
and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue 
that truth should be suspected  speak  is so 
if it be so  you have wound a goodly clew 
if it be not  forswear t  howe er  i charge thee 
as heaven shall work in me for thine avail 
tell me truly 


helena

                  good madam  pardon me 


countess

do you love my son 


helena

your pardon  noble mistress 


countess

love you my son 


helena

                  do not you love him  madam 


countess

go not about  my love hath in a bond 
whereof the world takes note  come  come  disclose
the state of your affection  for your passions
have to the full appeach d 


helena

then  i confess 
here on my knee  before high heaven and you 
that before you  and next unto high heaven 
i love your son 
my friends were poor  but honest  so my love 
be not offended  for it hurts not him
that he is loved of me  i follow him not
by any token of presumptuous suit 
nor would i have him till i do deserve him 
yet never know how that desert should be 
i know i love in vain  strive against hope 
yet in this captious and intenible sieve
i still pour in the waters of my love
and lack not to lose still  thus  indian like 
religious in mine error  i adore
the sun  that looks upon his worshipper 
but knows of him no more  my dearest madam 
let not your hate encounter with my love
for loving where you do  but if yourself 
whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth 
did ever in so true a flame of liking
wish chastely and love dearly  that your dian
was both herself and love  o  then  give pity
to her  whose state is such that cannot choose
but lend and give where she is sure to lose 
that seeks not to find that her search implies 
but riddle like lives sweetly where she dies 


countess

had you not lately an intent speak truly 
to go to paris 


helena

                  madam  i had 


countess

wherefore  tell true 


helena

i will tell truth  by grace itself i swear 
you know my father left me some prescriptions
of rare and proved effects  such as his reading
and manifest experience had collected
for general sovereignty  and that he will me
in heedfull reservation to bestow them 
as notes whose faculties inclusive were
more than they were in note  amongst the rest 
there is a remedy  approved  set down 
to cure the desperate languishings whereof
the king is render lost 


countess

this was your motive
for paris  was it  speak 


helena

my lord your son made me to think of this 
else paris and the medicine and the king
had from the conversation of my thoughts
haply been absent then 


countess

but think you  helen 
if you should tender your supposed aid 
he would receive it  he and his physicians
are of a mind  he  that they cannot help him 
they  that they cannot help  how shall they credit
a poor unlearned virgin  when the schools 
embowell of their doctrine  have left off
the danger to itself 


helena

there something in t 
more than my father skill  which was the greatest
of his profession  that his good receipt
shall for my legacy be sanctified
by the luckiest stars in heaven  and  would your honour
but give me leave to try success  i venture
the well lost life of mine on his grace cure
by such a day and hour 


countess

dost thou believe t 


helena

ay  madam  knowingly 


countess

why  helen  thou shalt have my leave and love 
means and attendants and my loving greetings
to those of mine in court  i stay at home
and pray god blessing into thy attempt 
be gone to morrow  and be sure of this 
what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss
