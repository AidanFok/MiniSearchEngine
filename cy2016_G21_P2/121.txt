come on  sir  i shall now put you to the height of
your breeding 


clown

i will show myself highly fed and lowly taught  i
know my business is but to the court 


countess

to the court  why  what place make you special 
when you put off that with such contempt  but to the court 


clown

truly  madam  if god have lent a man any manners  he
may easily put it off at court  he that cannot make
a leg  put off cap  kiss his hand and say nothing 
has neither leg  hands  lip  nor cap  and indeed
such a fellow  to say precisely  were not for the
court  but for me  i have an answer will serve all
men 


countess

the pin buttock  the quatch buttock  the brawn
buttock  or any buttock 


countess

will your answer serve fit to all questions 


clown

as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney 
as your french crown for your taffeta punk  as tib 
rush for tom forefinger  as a pancake for shrove
tuesday  a morris for may day  as the nail to his
hole  the cuckold to his horn  as a scolding queen
to a wrangling knave  as the nun lip to the
friar mouth  nay  as the pudding to his skin 


countess

have you  i say  an answer of such fitness for all
questions 


clown

from below your duke to beneath your constable  it
will fit any question 


countess

it must be an answer of most monstrous size that
must fit all demands 


clown

but a trifle neither  in good faith  if the learned
should speak truth of it  here it is  and all that
belongs to t  ask me if i am a courtier  it shall
do you no harm to learn 


countess

question  hoping to be the wiser by your answer  i
pray you  sir  are you a courtier

sequent to your whipping  you would answer very well
to a whipping  if you were but bound to t 


clown

i ne had worse luck in my life in my  lord 
sir  i see things may serve long  but not serve ever

to entertain so merrily with a fool 


clown

o lord  sir  why  there serves well again 


countess

and urge her to a present answer back
