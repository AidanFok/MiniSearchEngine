they say miracles are past  and we have our
philosophical persons  to make modern and familiar 
things supernatural and causeless  hence is it that
we make trifles of terrors  ensconcing ourselves
into seeming knowledge  when we should submit
ourselves to an unknown fear 


parolles

why   the rarest argument of wonder that hath
shot out in our latter times 


bertram

and so  tis 


lafeu

to be relinquish of the artists 


parolles

so i say 


lafeu

both of galen and paracelsus 


parolles

so i say 


lafeu

of all the learned and authentic fellows 


parolles

right  so i say 


lafeu

that gave him out incurable 


parolles

why  there  tis  so say i too 


lafeu

not to be helped 


parolles

right  as  twere  a man assured of a 


lafeu

uncertain life  and sure death 


parolles

just  you say well  so would i have said 


lafeu

i may truly say  it is a novelty to the world 


parolles

it is  indeed  if you will have it in showing  you
shall read it in what do you call there 


lafeu

a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor 


parolles

that it  i would have said the very same 


lafeu

why  your dolphin is not lustier   me 
i speak in respect 


parolles

nay   strange   very strange  that is the
brief and the tedious of it  and he of a most
facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the 


lafeu

very hand of heaven 


parolles

ay  so i say 


lafeu

in a most weak 
pausing
and debile minister  great power  great
transcendence  which should  indeed  give us a
further use to be made than alone the recovery of
the king  as to be 
pausing
generally thankful 


parolles

i would have said it  you say well  here comes the king 
enter king  helena  and attendants  lafeu and parolles retire


lafeu

lustig  as the dutchman says  i like a maid the
better  whilst i have a tooth in my head  why  he 
able to lead her a coranto 


parolles

mort du vinaigre  is not this helen 


lafeu

 god  i think so 


king

go  call before me all the lords in court 
sit  my preserver  by thy patient side 
and with this healthful hand  whose banish sense
thou hast repeal d  a second time receive
the confirmation of my promised gift 
which but attends thy naming 
enter three or four lords
fair maid  send forth thine eye  this youthful parcel
of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing 
o whom both sovereign power and father voice
i have to use  thy frank election make 
thou hast power to choose  and they none to forsake 


helena

to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
fall  when love please  marry  to each  but one 


lafeu

i give bay curtal and his furniture 
my mouth no more were broken than these boys 
and writ as little beard 


king

peruse them well 
not one of those but had a noble father 


helena

gentlemen 
heaven hath through me restored the king to health 


all

we understand it  and thank heaven for you 


helena

i am a simple maid  and therein wealthiest 
that i protest i simply am a maid 
please it your majesty  i have done already 
the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me 
 blush that thou shouldst choose  but  be refused 
let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever 
we ne come there again 


king

make choice  and  see 
who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me 


helena

now  dian  from thy altar do i fly 
and to imperial love  that god most high 
do my sighs stream  sir  will you hear my suit 


first lord

and grant it 


helena

                  thanks  sir  all the rest is mute 


lafeu

i had rather be in this choice than throw ames ace
for my life 


helena

the honour  sir  that flames in your fair eyes 
before i speak  too threateningly replies 
love make your fortunes twenty times above
her that so wishes and her humble love 


second lord

no better  if you please 


helena

my wish receive 
which great love grant  and so  i take my leave 


lafeu

do all they deny her  an they were sons of mine 
i have them whipped  or i would send them to the
turk  to make eunuchs of 


helena

be not afraid that i your hand should take 
i never do you wrong for your own sake 
blessing upon your vows  and in your bed
find fairer fortune  if you ever wed 


lafeu

these boys are boys of ice  they none have her 
sure  they are bastards to the english  the french
ne got  em 


helena

you are too young  too happy  and too good 
to make yourself a son out of my blood 


fourth lord

fair one  i think not so 


lafeu

there one grape yet  i am sure thy father drunk
wine  but if thou be not an ass  i am a youth
of fourteen  i have known thee already 


helena

 to bertram   i dare not say i take you  but i give
me and my service  ever whilst i live 
into your guiding power  this is the man 


king

why  then  young bertram  take her  she thy wife 


bertram

my wife  my liege  i shall beseech your highness 
in such a business give me leave to use
the help of mine own eyes 


king

know thou not  bertram 
what she has done for me 


bertram

yes  my good lord 
but never hope to know why i should marry her 


king

thou know she has raised me from my sickly bed 


bertram

but follows it  my lord  to bring me down
must answer for your raising  i know her well 
she had her breeding at my father charge 
a poor physician daughter my wife  disdain
rather corrupt me ever 


king

 only title thou disdain in her  the which
i can build up  strange is it that our bloods 
of colour  weight  and heat  pour all together 
would quite confound distinction  yet stand off
in differences so mighty  if she be
all that is virtuous  save what thou dislikest 
a poor physician daughter  thou dislikest
of virtue for the name  but do not so 
from lowest place when virtuous things proceed 
the place is dignified by the doer deed 
where great additions swell s  and virtue none 
it is a dropsied honour  good alone
is good without a name  vileness is so 
the property by what it is should go 
not by the title  she is young  wise  fair 
in these to nature she immediate heir 
and these breed honour  that is honour scorn 
which challenges itself as honour born
and is not like the sire  honours thrive 
when rather from our acts we them derive
than our foregoers  the mere word a slave
debosh on every tomb  on every grave
a lying trophy  and as oft is dumb
where dust and damn oblivion is the tomb
of honour bones indeed  what should be said 
if thou canst like this creature as a maid 
i can create the rest  virtue and she
is her own dower  honour and wealth from me 


bertram

i cannot love her  nor will strive to do t 


king

thou wrong thyself  if thou shouldst strive to choose 


helena

that you are well restored  my lord  i glad 
let the rest go 


king

my honour at the stake  which to defeat 
i must produce my power  here  take her hand 
proud scornful boy  unworthy this good gift 
that dost in vile misprision shackle up
my love and her desert  that canst not dream 
we  poising us in her defective scale 
shall weigh thee to the beam  that wilt not know 
it is in us to plant thine honour where
we please to have it grow  cheque thy contempt 
obey our will  which travails in thy good 
believe not thy disdain  but presently
do thine own fortunes that obedient right
which both thy duty owes and our power claims 
or i will throw thee from my care for ever
into the staggers and the careless lapse
of youth and ignorance  both my revenge and hate
loosing upon thee  in the name of justice 
without all terms of pity  speak  thine answer 


bertram

pardon  my gracious lord  for i submit
my fancy to your eyes  when i consider
what great creation and what dole of honour
flies where you bid it  i find that she  which late
was in my nobler thoughts most base  is now
the praised of the king  who  so ennobled 
is as  born so 


king

take her by the hand 
and tell her she is thine  to whom i promise
a counterpoise  if not to thy estate
a balance more replete 


bertram

i take her hand 


king

good fortune and the favour of the king
smile upon this contract  whose ceremony
shall seem expedient on the now born brief 
and be perform to night  the solemn feast
shall more attend upon the coming space 
expecting absent friends  as thou lovest her 
thy love to me religious  else  does err 
exeunt all but lafeu and parolles


lafeu

 advancing   do you hear  monsieur  a word with you 


parolles

your pleasure  sir 


lafeu

your lord and master did well to make his
recantation 


parolles

recantation  my lord  my master 


lafeu

ay  is it not a language i speak 


parolles

a most harsh one  and not to be understood without
bloody succeeding  my master 


lafeu

are you companion to the count rousillon 


parolles

to any count  to all counts  to what is man 


lafeu

to what is count man  count master is of
another style 


parolles

you are too old  sir  let it satisfy you  you are too old 


lafeu

i must tell thee  sirrah  i write man  to which
title age cannot bring thee 


parolles

what i dare too well do  i dare not do 


lafeu

i did think thee  for two ordinaries  to be a pretty
wise fellow  thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
travel  it might pass  yet the scarfs and the
bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen  i
have now found thee  when i lose thee again  i care
not  yet art thou good for nothing but taking up  and
that thou scarce worth 


parolles

hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee 


lafeu

do not plunge thyself too far in anger  lest thou
hasten thy trial  which if lord have mercy on thee
for a hen  so  my good window of lattice  fare thee
well  thy casement i need not open  for i look
through thee  give me thy hand 


parolles

my lord  you give me most egregious indignity 


lafeu

ay  with all my heart  and thou art worthy of it 


parolles

i have not  my lord  deserved it 


lafeu

yes  good faith  every dram of it  and i will not
bate thee a scruple 


parolles

well  i shall be wiser 


lafeu

even as soon as thou canst  for thou hast to pull at
a smack o  the contrary  if ever thou be bound
in thy scarf and beaten  thou shalt find what it is
to be proud of thy bondage  i have a desire to hold
my acquaintance with thee  or rather my knowledge 
that i may say in the default  he is a man i know 


parolles

my lord  you do me most insupportable vexation 


lafeu

i would it were hell pains for thy sake  and my poor
doing eternal  for doing i am past  as i will by
thee  in what motion age will give me leave 
exit


parolles

well  thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off
me  scurvy  old  filthy  scurvy lord  well  i must
be patient  there is no fettering of authority 
i beat him  by my life  if i can meet him with
any convenience  an he were double and double a
lord  i have no more pity of his age than i
would of i beat him  an if i could but meet him again 
re enter lafeu


lafeu

sirrah  your lord and master married  there news
for you  you have a new mistress 


parolles

i most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
some reservation of your wrongs  he is my good
lord  whom i serve above is my master 


lafeu

who  god 


parolles

ay  sir 


lafeu

the devil it is that thy master  why dost thou
garter up thy arms o  this fashion  dost make hose of
sleeves  do other servants so  thou wert best set
thy lower part where thy nose stands  by mine
honour  if i were but two hours younger  i beat
thee  methinks  thou art a general offence  and
every man should beat thee  i think thou wast
created for men to breathe themselves upon thee 


parolles

this is hard and undeserved measure  my lord 


lafeu

go to  sir  you were beaten in italy for picking a
kernel out of a pomegranate  you are a vagabond and
no true traveller  you are more saucy with lords
and honourable personages than the commission of your
birth and virtue gives you heraldry  you are not
worth another word  else i call you knave  i leave you 
exit


parolles

good  very good  it is so then  good  very good 
let it be concealed awhile

the tread of a man foot  to the wars

there letters from my mother  what the import is 
i know not yet 


parolles

ay  that would be known  to the wars  my boy  to the wars 
he wears his honour in a box unseen 
that hugs his kicky wicky here at home 
spending his manly marrow in her arms 
which should sustain the bound and high curvet
of mars fiery steed  to other regions
france is a stable  we that dwell in jades 
therefore  to the war 


bertram

it shall be so  i send her to my house 
acquaint my mother with my hate to her 
and wherefore i am fled  write to the king
that which i durst not speak  his present gift
shall furnish me to those italian fields 
where noble fellows strike  war is no strife
to the dark house and the detested wife 


parolles

will this capriccio hold in thee  art sure 


bertram

go with me to my chamber  and advise me 
i send her straight away  to morrow
i to the wars  she to her single sorrow
