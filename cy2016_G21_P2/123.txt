enter helena and clown


helena

my mother greets me kindly  is she well 


clown

she is not well  but yet she has her health  she 
very merry  but yet she is not well  but thanks be
given  she very well and wants nothing i  the
world  but yet she is not well 


helena

if she be very well  what does she ail  that she 
not very well 


clown

truly  she very well indeed  but for two things 


helena

what two things 


clown

one  that she not in heaven  whither god send her
quickly  the other that she in earth  from whence
god send her quickly 
enter parolles


parolles

bless you  my fortunate lady 


helena

i hope  sir  i have your good will to have mine own
good fortunes 


parolles

you had my prayers to lead them on  and to keep them
on  have them still  o  my knave  how does my old lady 


clown

so that you had her wrinkles and i her money 
i would she did as you say 


parolles

why  i say nothing 


clown

marry  you are the wiser man  for many a man 
tongue shakes out his master undoing  to say
nothing  to do nothing  to know nothing  and to have
nothing  is to be a great part of your title  which
is within a very little of nothing 


parolles

away  thou a knave 


clown

you should have said  sir  before a knave thou a
knave  that s  before me thou a knave  this had
been truth  sir 


parolles

go to  thou art a witty fool  i have found thee 


clown

did you find me in yourself  sir  or were you
taught to find me  the search  sir  was profitable 
and much fool may you find in you  even to the
world pleasure and the increase of laughter 


parolles

a good knave  i  faith  and well fed 
madam  my lord will go away to night 
a very serious business calls on him 
the great prerogative and rite of love 
which  as your due  time claims  he does acknowledge 
but puts it off to a compell restraint 
whose want  and whose delay  is strew with sweets 
which they distil now in the curbed time 
to make the coming hour o with joy
and pleasure drown the brim 


helena

what his will else 


parolles

that you will take your instant leave o  the king
and make this haste as your own good proceeding 
strengthen with what apology you think
may make it probable need 


helena

what more commands he 


parolles

that  having this obtain d  you presently
attend his further pleasure 


helena

in every thing i wait upon his will 


parolles

i shall report it so 


helena

i pray you 
exit parolles
come  sirrah 
exeunt
