enter lafeu and bertram


lafeu

but i hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier 


bertram

yes  my lord  and of very valiant approof 


lafeu

you have it from his own deliverance 


bertram

and by other warranted testimony 


lafeu

then my dial goes not true  i took this lark for a bunting 


bertram

i do assure you  my lord  he is very great in
knowledge and accordingly valiant 


lafeu

i have then sinned against his experience and
transgressed against his valour  and my state that
way is dangerous  since i cannot yet find in my
heart to repent  here he comes  i pray you  make
us friends  i will pursue the amity 
enter parolles


parolles

 to bertram   these things shall be done  sir 


lafeu

pray you  sir  who his tailor 


parolles

sir 


lafeu

o  i know him well  i  sir  he  sir   a good
workman  a very good tailor

parolles

she is 


bertram

will she away to night 


parolles

as you have her 


bertram

i have writ my letters  casketed my treasure 
given order for our horses  and to night 
when i should take possession of the bride 
end ere i do begin 


lafeu

a good traveller is something at the latter end of a
dinner  but one that lies three thirds and uses a
known truth to pass a thousand nothings with  should
be once heard and thrice beaten  god save you  captain 


bertram

is there any unkindness between my lord and you  monsieur 


parolles

i know not how i have deserved to run into my lord 
displeasure 


lafeu

you have made shift to run into  t  boots and spurs
and all  like him that leaped into the custard  and
out of it you run again  rather than suffer
question for your residence 


bertram

it may be you have mistaken him  my lord 


lafeu

and shall do so ever  though i took him at  
prayers  fare you well  my lord  and believe this
of me  there can be no kernel in this light nut  the
soul of this man is his clothes  trust him not in
matter of heavy consequence  i have kept of them
tame  and know their natures  farewell  monsieur 
i have spoken better of you than you have or will to
deserve at my hand  but we must do good against evil 
exit


parolles

an idle lord  i swear 


bertram

i think so 


parolles

why  do you not know him 


bertram

yes  i do know him well  and common speech
gives him a worthy pass  here comes my clog 
enter helena


helena

i have  sir  as i was commanded from you 
spoke with the king and have procured his leave
for present parting  only he desires
some private speech with you 


bertram

i shall obey his will 
you must not marvel  helen  at my course 
which holds not colour with the time  nor does
the ministration and required office
on my particular  prepared i was not
for such a business  therefore am i found
so much unsettled  this drives me to entreat you
that presently you take our way for home 
and rather muse than ask why i entreat you 
for my respects are better than they seem
and my appointments have in them a need
greater than shows itself at the first view
to you that know them not  this to my mother 
giving a letter
 be two days ere i shall see you  so
i leave you to your wisdom 


helena

sir  i can nothing say 
but that i am your most obedient servant 


bertram

come  come  no more of that 


helena

and ever shall
with true observance seek to eke out that
wherein toward me my homely stars have fail 
to equal my great fortune 


bertram

let that go 
my haste is very great  farewell  hie home 


helena

pray  sir  your pardon 


bertram

well  what would you say 


helena

i am not worthy of the wealth i owe 
nor dare i say  mine  and yet it is 
but  like a timorous thief  most fain would steal
what law does vouch mine own 


bertram

what would you have 


helena

something  and scarce so much  nothing  indeed 
i would not tell you what i would  my lord 
faith yes 
strangers and foes do sunder  and not kiss 


bertram

i pray you  stay not  but in haste to horse 


helena

i shall not break your bidding  good my lord 


bertram

where are my other men  monsieur  farewell 
exit helena
go thou toward home  where i will never come
whilst i can shake my sword or hear the drum 
away  and for our flight 


parolles

bravely  coragio 
exeunt
