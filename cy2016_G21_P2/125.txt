scene i  florence  the duke palace 


flourish  enter the duke of florence attended  the two frenchmen  with a troop of soldiers 


duke

so that from point to point now have you heard
the fundamental reasons of this war 
whose great decision hath much blood let forth
and more thirsts after 


first lord

holy seems the quarrel
upon your grace part  black and fearful
on the opposer 


duke

therefore we marvel much our cousin france
would in so just a business shut his bosom
against our borrowing prayers 


second lord

good my lord 
the reasons of our state i cannot yield 
but like a common and an outward man 
that the great figure of a council frames
by self unable motion  therefore dare not
say what i think of it  since i have found

first lord

but i am sure the younger of our nature 
that surfeit on their ease  will day by day

duke

welcome shall they be 
and all the honours that can fly from us
shall on them settle  you know your places well 
when better fall  for your avails they fell 
to morrow to the field 
flourish  exeunt
