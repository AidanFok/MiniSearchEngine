to you 	your unfortunate son

by the misprising of a maid too virtuous
for the contempt of empire

comfort  your son will not be killed so soon as i
thought he would

 but the boldness of his hand  haply  which his
heart was not consenting to 


countess

nothing in france  until he have no wife 
there nothing here that is too good for him
but only she  and she deserves a lord
that twenty such rude boys might tend upon
and call her hourly mistress  who was with him 


first gentleman

a servant only  and a gentleman
which i have sometime known 


countess

parolles  was it not

the fellow has a deal of that too much 
which holds him much to have 


countess

to tell him that his sword can never win

 i have no wife  i have nothing in france 
nothing in france  until he has no wife 
thou shalt have none  rousillon  none in france 
then hast thou all again  poor lord  is i
that chase thee from thy country and expose
those tender limbs of thine to the event
of the none sparing war  and is it i
that drive thee from the sportive court  where thou
wast shot at with fair eyes  to be the mark
of smoky muskets  o you leaden messengers 
that ride upon the violent speed of fire 
fly with false aim  move the still peering air 
that sings with piercing  do not touch my lord 
whoever shoots at him  i set him there 
whoever charges on his forward breast 
i am the caitiff that do hold him to t 
and  though i kill him not  i am the cause
his death was so effected  better  
i met the ravin lion when he roar 
with sharp constraint of hunger  better  
that all the miseries which nature owes
were mine at once  no  come thou home  rousillon 
whence honour but of danger wins a scar 
as oft it loses all  i will be gone 
my being here it is that holds thee hence 
shall i stay here to do t   no  no  although
the air of paradise did fan the house
and angels officed all  i will be gone 
that pitiful rumour may report my flight 
to consolate thine ear  come  night  end  day 
for with the dark  poor thief  i steal away
