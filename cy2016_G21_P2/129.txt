commander  and that with his own hand he slew the
duke brother 
tucket
we have lost our labour  they are gone a contrary
way  hark  you may know by their trumpets 


mariana

come  let return again  and suffice ourselves with
the report of it  well  diana  take heed of this
french earl  the honour of a maid is her name  and
no legacy is so rich as honesty 


widow

i have told my neighbour how you have been solicited
by a gentleman his companion 


mariana

i know that knave  hang him  one parolles  a
filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the
young earl  beware of them  diana  their promises 
enticements  oaths  tokens  and all these engines of
lust  are not the things they go under  many a maid
hath been seduced by them  and the misery is 
example  that so terrible shows in the wreck of
maidenhood  cannot for all that dissuade succession 
but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten
them  i hope i need not to advise you further  but
i hope your own grace will keep you where you are 
though there were no further danger known but the
modesty which is so lost 


diana

you shall not need to fear me 


widow

i hope so 
enter helena  disguised like a pilgrim
look  here comes a pilgrim  i know she will lie at
my house  thither they send one another  i 
question her  god save you  pilgrim  whither are you bound 


helena

to saint jaques le grand 
where do the palmers lodge  i do beseech you 


widow

at the saint francis here beside the port 


helena

is this the way 


widow

ay  marry  is t 
a march afar
hark you  they come this way 
if you will tarry  holy pilgrim 
but till the troops come by 
i will conduct you where you shall be lodged 
the rather  for i think i know your hostess
as ample as myself 


helena

widow

if you shall please so  pilgrim 


helena

i thank you  and will stay upon your leisure 


widow

helena

i did so 


widow

here you shall see a countryman of yours
that has done worthy service 


helena

his name  i pray you 


diana

the count rousillon  know you such a one 


helena

but by the ear  that hears most nobly of him 
his face i know not 


diana

whatsome he is 
he bravely taken here  he stole from france 
as  reported  for the king had married him
against his liking  think you it is so 


helena

ay  surely  mere the truth  i know his lady 


diana

there is a gentleman that serves the count
reports but coarsely of her 


helena

what his name 


diana

monsieur parolles 


helena

                  o  i believe with him 
in argument of praise  or to the worth
of the great count himself  she is too mean
to have her name repeated  all her deserving
is a reserved honesty  and that
i have not heard examined 


diana

alas  poor lady 
 a hard bondage to become the wife
of a detesting lord 


widow

i warrant  good creature  wheresoe she is 
her heart weighs sadly  this young maid might do her
a shrewd turn  if she pleased 


helena

how do you mean 
may be the amorous count solicits her
in the unlawful purpose 


widow

he does indeed 
and brokes with all that can in such a suit
corrupt the tender honour of a maid 
but she is arm for him and keeps her guard
in honestest defence 


mariana

the gods forbid else 


widow

so  now they come 
drum and colours
enter bertram  parolles  and the whole army
that is antonio  the duke eldest son 
that  escalus 


helena

                  which is the frenchman 


diana

he 
that with the plume   a most gallant fellow 
i would he loved his wife  if he were honester
he were much goodlier  is not a handsome gentleman 


helena

i like him well 


diana

 pity he is not honest  yond that same knave
that leads him to these places  were i his lady 
i would poison that vile rascal 


helena

which is he 


diana

that jack an apes with scarfs  why is he melancholy 


helena

perchance he hurt i  the battle 


parolles
