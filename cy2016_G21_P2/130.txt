scene vi  camp before florence 


enter bertram and the two french lords


second lord

nay  good my lord  put him to t  let him have his
way 


first lord

if your lordship find him not a hilding  hold me no
more in your respect 


second lord

on my life  my lord  a bubble 


bertram

do you think i am so far deceived in him 


second lord

believe it  my lord  in mine own direct knowledge 
without any malice  but to speak of him as my
kinsman  he a most notable coward  an infinite and
endless liar  an hourly promise breaker  the owner
of no one good quality worthy your lordship 
entertainment 


first lord

it were fit you knew him  lest  reposing too far in
his virtue  which he hath not  he might at some
great and trusty business in a main danger fail you 


bertram

i would i knew in what particular action to try him 


first lord

none better than to let him fetch off his drum 
which you hear him so confidently undertake to do 


second lord

i  with a troop of florentines  will suddenly
surprise him  such i will have  whom i am sure he
knows not from the enemy  we will bind and hoodwink
him so  that he shall suppose no other but that he
is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries  when
we bring him to our own tents  be but your lordship
present at his examination  if he do not  for the
promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
base fear  offer to betray you and deliver all the
intelligence in his power against you  and that with
the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath  never
trust my judgment in any thing 


first lord

o  for the love of laughter  let him fetch his drum 
he says he has a stratagem for t  when your
lordship sees the bottom of his success in t  and to
what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
melted  if you give him not john drum 
entertainment  your inclining cannot be removed 
here he comes 
enter parolles


second lord

 aside to bertram   o  for the love of laughter 
hinder not the honour of his design  let him fetch
off his drum in any hand 


bertram

how now  monsieur  this drum sticks sorely in your
disposition 


first lord

a pox on t  let it go   but a drum 


parolles

 a drum  is a drum  a drum so lost 
there was excellent command to charge in with our
horse upon our own wings  and to rend our own soldiers 


first lord

that was not to be blamed in the command of the
service  it was a disaster of war that caesar
himself could not have prevented  if he had been
there to command 


bertram

well  we cannot greatly condemn our success  some
dishonour we had in the loss of that drum  but it is
not to be recovered 


parolles

it might have been recovered 


bertram

it might  but it is not now 


parolles

it is to be recovered  but that the merit of
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
performer  i would have that drum or another  or
 jacet 


bertram

why  if you have a stomach  to t  monsieur  if you
think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
instrument of honour again into his native quarter 
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on  i will
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit  if you
speed well in it  the duke shall both speak of it 
and extend to you what further becomes his
greatness  even to the utmost syllable of your
worthiness 


parolles

by the hand of a soldier  i will undertake it 


bertram

but you must not now slumber in it 


parolles

i about it this evening  and i will presently
pen down my dilemmas  encourage myself in my
certainty  put myself into my mortal preparation 
and by midnight look to hear further from me 


bertram

may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it 


parolles

i know not what the success will be  my lord  but
the attempt i vow 


bertram

i know thou valiant  and  to the possibility of
thy soldiership  will subscribe for thee  farewell 


parolles

i love not many words 
exit


second lord

no more than a fish loves water  is not this a
strange fellow  my lord  that so confidently seems
to undertake this business  which he knows is not to
be done  damns himself to do and dares better be
damned than to do t 


first lord

you do not know him  my lord  as we do  certain it
is that he will steal himself into a man favour and
for a week escape a great deal of discoveries  but
when you find him out  you have him ever after 


bertram

why  do you think he will make no deed at all of
this that so seriously he does address himself unto 


second lord

none in the world  but return with an invention and
clap upon you two or three probable lies  but we
have almost embossed him  you shall see his fall
to night  for indeed he is not for your lordship respect 


first lord

we make you some sport with the fox ere we case
him  he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu 
when his disguise and he is parted  tell me what a
sprat you shall find him  which you shall see this
very night 


second lord

i must go look my twigs  he shall be caught 


bertram

your brother he shall go along with me 


second lord

as please your lordship  i leave you 
exit


bertram

now will i lead you to the house  and show you
the lass i spoke of 


first lord

but you say she honest 


bertram

that all the fault  i spoke with her but once
and found her wondrous cold  but i sent to her 
by this same coxcomb that we have i  the wind 
tokens and letters which she did re send 
and this is all i have done  she a fair creature 
will you go see her 


first lord

with all my heart  my lord 
exeunt
