scene vii  florence  the widow house 


enter helena and widow


helena

if you misdoubt me that i am not she 
i know not how i shall assure you further 
but i shall lose the grounds i work upon 


widow

though my estate be fallen  i was well born 
nothing acquainted with these businesses 
and would not put my reputation now
in any staining act 


helena

nor would i wish you 
first  give me trust  the count he is my husband 
and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken
is so from word to word  and then you cannot 
by the good aid that i of you shall borrow 
err in bestowing it 


widow

i should believe you 
for you have show me that which well approves
you great in fortune 


helena

take this purse of gold 
and let me buy your friendly help thus far 
which i will over pay and pay again
when i have found it  the count he wooes your daughter 
lays down his wanton siege before her beauty 
resolved to carry her  let her in fine consent 
as we direct her how  best to bear it 
now his important blood will nought deny
that she demand  a ring the county wears 
that downward hath succeeded in his house
from son to son  some four or five descents
since the first father wore it  this ring he holds
in most rich choice  yet in his idle fire 
to buy his will  it would not seem too dear 
howe repented after 


widow

now i see
the bottom of your purpose 


helena

you see it lawful  then  it is no more 
but that your daughter  ere she seems as won 
desires this ring  appoints him an encounter 
in fine  delivers me to fill the time 
herself most chastely absent  after this 
to marry her  i add three thousand crowns
to what is passed already 


widow

i have yielded 
instruct my daughter how she shall persever 
that time and place with this deceit so lawful
may prove coherent  every night he comes
with musics of all sorts and songs composed
to her unworthiness  it nothing steads us
to chide him from our eaves  for he persists
as if his life lay on t 


helena

why then to night
let us assay our plot  which  if it speed 
is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
and lawful meaning in a lawful act 
where both not sin  and yet a sinful fact 
but let about it 
exeunt
