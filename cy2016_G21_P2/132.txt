scene i  without the florentine camp 


enter second french lord  with five or six other soldiers in ambush


second lord

he can come no other way but by this hedge corner 
when you sally upon him  speak what terrible
language you will  though you understand it not
yourselves  no matter  for we must not seem to
understand him  unless some one among us whom we
must produce for an interpreter 


first soldier

good captain  let me be the interpreter 


second lord

art not acquainted with him  knows he not thy voice 


first soldier

no  sir  i warrant you 


second lord

but what linsey woolsey hast thou to speak to us again 


first soldier

e such as you speak to me 


second lord

he must think us some band of strangers i  the
adversary entertainment  now he hath a smack of
all neighbouring languages  therefore we must every
one be a man of his own fancy  not to know what we
speak one to another  so we seem to know  is to
know straight our purpose  choughs  language 
gabble enough  and good enough  as for you 
interpreter  you must seem very politic  but couch 
ho  here he comes  to beguile two hours in a sleep 
and then to return and swear the lies he forges 
enter parolles


parolles

ten o clock  within these three hours  be
time enough to go home  what shall i say i have
done  it must be a very plausive invention that
carries it  they begin to smoke me  and disgraces
have of late knocked too often at my door  i find
my tongue is too foolhardy  but my heart hath the
fear of mars before it and of his creatures  not
daring the reports of my tongue 


second lord

this is the first truth that e thine own tongue
was guilty of 


parolles

what the devil should move me to undertake the
recovery of this drum  being not ignorant of the
impossibility  and knowing i had no such purpose  i
must give myself some hurts  and say i got them in
exploit  yet slight ones will not carry it  they
will say   you off with so little  and great
ones i dare not give  wherefore  what the
instance  tongue  i must put you into a
butter woman mouth and buy myself another of
bajazet mule  if you prattle me into these perils 


second lord

is it possible he should know what he is  and be
that he is 


parolles

i would the cutting of my garments would serve the
turn  or the breaking of my spanish sword 


second lord

we cannot afford you so 


parolles

or the baring of my beard  and to say it was in
stratagem 


second lord

 not do 


parolles

or to drown my clothes  and say i was stripped 


second lord

hardly serve 


parolles

though i swore i leaped from the window of the citadel 


second lord

how deep 


parolles

thirty fathom 


second lord

three great oaths would scarce make that be believed 


parolles

i would i had any drum of the enemy s  i would swear
i recovered it 


second lord

you shall hear one anon 


parolles

a drum now of the enemy s 
alarum within

and i shall lose my life for want of language 
if there be here german  or dane  low dutch 
italian  or french  let him speak to me  i 
discover that which shall undo the florentine

and  hoodwink as thou art  will lead thee on
