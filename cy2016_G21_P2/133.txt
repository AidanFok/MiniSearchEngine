scene ii  florence  the widow house 


enter bertram and diana


bertram

they told me that your name was fontibell 


diana

no  my good lord  diana 


bertram

titled goddess 
and worth it  with addition  but  fair soul 
in your fine frame hath love no quality 
if quick fire of youth light not your mind 
you are no maiden  but a monument 
when you are dead  you should be such a one
as you are now  for you are cold and stem 
and now you should be as your mother was
when your sweet self was got 


diana

she then was honest 


bertram

so should you be 


diana

no 
my mother did but duty  such  my lord 
as you owe to your wife 


bertram

no more o  that 
i prithee  do not strive against my vows 
i was compell to her  but i love thee
by love own sweet constraint  and will for ever
do thee all rights of service 


diana

ay  so you serve us
till we serve you  but when you have our roses 
you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
and mock us with our bareness 


bertram

how have i sworn 


diana

 not the many oaths that makes the truth 
but the plain single vow that is vow true 
what is not holy  that we swear not by 
but take the high to witness  then  pray you  tell me 
if i should swear by god great attributes 
i loved you dearly  would you believe my oaths 
when i did love you ill  this has no holding 
to swear by him whom i protest to love 
that i will work against him  therefore your oaths
are words and poor conditions  but unseal d 
at least in my opinion 


bertram

change it  change it 
be not so holy cruel  love is holy 
and my integrity ne knew the crafts
that you do charge men with  stand no more off 
but give thyself unto my sick desires 
who then recover  say thou art mine  and ever
my love as it begins shall so persever 


diana

i see that men make ropes in such a scarre
that we forsake ourselves  give me that ring 


bertram

i lend it thee  my dear  but have no power
to give it from me 


diana

will you not  my lord 


bertram

it is an honour  to our house 
bequeathed down from many ancestors 
which were the greatest obloquy i  the world
in me to lose 


diana

                  mine honour such a ring 
my chastity the jewel of our house 
bequeathed down from many ancestors 
which were the greatest obloquy i  the world
in me to lose  thus your own proper wisdom
brings in the champion honour on my part 
against your vain assault 


bertram

here  take my ring 
my house  mine honour  yea  my life  be thine 
and i be bid by thee 


diana

when midnight comes  knock at my chamber window 
i order take my mother shall not hear 
now will i charge you in the band of truth 
when you have conquer my yet maiden bed 
remain there but an hour  nor speak to me 
my reasons are most strong  and you shall know them
when back again this ring shall be deliver d 
and on your finger in the night i put
another ring  that what in time proceeds
may token to the future our past deeds 
adieu  till then  then  fail not  you have won
a wife of me  though there my hope be done 


bertram

a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee 
exit


diana

for which live long to thank both heaven and me 
you may so in the end 
my mother told me just how he would woo 
as if she sat in  heart  she says all men
have the like oaths  he had sworn to marry me
when his wife dead  therefore i lie with him
when i am buried  since frenchmen are so braid 
marry that will  i live and die a maid 
only in this disguise i think no sin
to cozen him that would unjustly win 
exit
