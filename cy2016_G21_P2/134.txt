scene iii  the florentine camp 


enter the two french lords and some two or three soldiers


first lord

you have not given him his mother letter 


second lord

i have delivered it an hour since  there is
something in that stings his nature  for on the
reading it he changed almost into another man 


first lord

he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
off so good a wife and so sweet a lady 


second lord

especially he hath incurred the everlasting
displeasure of the king  who had even tuned his
bounty to sing happiness to him  i will tell you a
thing  but you shall let it dwell darkly with you 


first lord

when you have spoken it   dead  and i am the
grave of it 


second lord

he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
florence  of a most chaste renown  and this night he
fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour  he hath
given her his monumental ring  and thinks himself
made in the unchaste composition 


first lord

now  god delay our rebellion  as we are ourselves 
what things are we 


second lord

merely our own traitors  and as in the common course
of all treasons  we still see them reveal
themselves  till they attain to their abhorred ends 
so he that in this action contrives against his own
nobility  in his proper stream o himself 


first lord

is it not meant damnable in us  to be trumpeters of
our unlawful intents  we shall not then have his
company to night 


second lord

not till after midnight  for he is dieted to his hour 


first lord

that approaches apace  i would gladly have him see
his company anatomized  that he might take a measure
of his own judgments  wherein so curiously he had
set this counterfeit 


second lord

we will not meddle with him till he come  for his
presence must be the whip of the other 


first lord

in the mean time  what hear you of these wars 


second lord

i hear there is an overture of peace 


first lord

nay  i assure you  a peace concluded 


second lord

what will count rousillon do then  will he travel
higher  or return again into france 


first lord

i perceive  by this demand  you are not altogether
of his council 


second lord

let it be forbid  sir  so should i be a great deal
of his act 


first lord

sir  his wife some two months since fled from his
house  her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques
le grand  which holy undertaking with most austere
sanctimony she accomplished  and  there residing the
tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
grief  in fine  made a groan of her last breath  and
now she sings in heaven 


second lord

how is this justified 


first lord

the stronger part of it by her own letters  which
makes her story true  even to the point of her
death  her death itself  which could not be her
office to say is come  was faithfully confirmed by
the rector of the place 


second lord

hath the count all this intelligence 


first lord

ay  and the particular confirmations  point from
point  so to the full arming of the verity 


second lord

i am heartily sorry that he be glad of this 


first lord

how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses 


second lord

and how mightily some other times we drown our gain
in tears  the great dignity that his valour hath
here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
with a shame as ample 


first lord

the web of our life is of a mingled yarn  good and
ill together  our virtues would be proud  if our
faults whipped them not  and our crimes would
despair  if they were not cherished by our virtues 
enter a messenger
how now  where your master 


servant

he met the duke in the street  sir  of whom he hath
taken a solemn leave  his lordship will next
morning for france  the duke hath offered him
letters of commendations to the king 


second lord

they shall be no more than needful there  if they
were more than they can commend 


first lord

they cannot be too sweet for the king tartness 
here his lordship now 
enter bertram
how now  my lord  is not after midnight 


bertram

i have to night dispatched sixteen businesses  a
month length a piece  by an abstract of success 
i have congied with the duke  done my adieu with his
nearest  buried a wife  mourned for her  writ to my
lady mother i am returning  entertained my convoy 
and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
many nicer needs  the last was the greatest  but
that i have not ended yet 


second lord

if the business be of any difficulty  and this
morning your departure hence  it requires haste of
your lordship 


bertram

i mean  the business is not ended  as fearing to
hear of it hereafter  but shall we have this
dialogue between the fool and the soldier  come 
bring forth this counterfeit module  he has deceived
me  like a double meaning prophesier 


second lord

bring him forth  has sat i  the stocks all night 
poor gallant knave 


bertram

no matter  his heels have deserved it  in usurping
his spurs so long  how does he carry himself 


second lord

i have told your lordship already  the stocks carry
him  but to answer you as you would be understood 
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk  he
hath confessed himself to morgan  whom he supposes
to be a friar  from the time of his remembrance to
this very instant disaster of his setting i  the
stocks  and what think you he hath confessed 


bertram

nothing of me  has a 


second lord

his confession is taken  and it shall be read to his
face  if your lordship be in t  as i believe you
are  you must have the patience to hear it 
enter parolles guarded  and first soldier


bertram

a plague upon him  muffled  he can say nothing of
me  hush  hush 


first lord

hoodman comes  portotartarosa


first soldier

he calls for the tortures  what will you say
without  em 


parolles

i will confess what i know without constraint  if
ye pinch me like a pasty  i can say no more 


first soldier

bosko chimurcho 


first lord

boblibindo chicurmurco 


first soldier

you are a merciful general  our general bids you
answer to what i shall ask you out of a note 


parolles

and truly  as i hope to live 


first soldier

 reads    demand of him how many horse the
duke is strong  what say you to that 


parolles

five or six thousand  but very weak and
unserviceable  the troops are all scattered  and
the commanders very poor rogues  upon my reputation
and credit and as i hope to live 


first soldier

shall i set down your answer so 


parolles

do  i take the sacrament on t  how and which way you will 


bertram

all one to him  what a past saving slave is this 


first lord

you deceived  my lord  this is monsieur
parolles  the gallant militarist that was his own
phrase that had the whole theoric of war in the
knot of his scarf  and the practise in the chape of
his dagger 


second lord

i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
clean  nor believe he can have every thing in him
by wearing his apparel neatly 


first soldier

well  that set down 


parolles

five or six thousand horse  i said  i will say
true or thereabouts  set down  for i speak truth 


first lord

he very near the truth in this 


bertram

but i con him no thanks for t  in the nature he
delivers it 


parolles

poor rogues  i pray you  say 


first soldier

well  that set down 


parolles

i humbly thank you  sir  a truth a truth  the
rogues are marvellous poor 


first soldier

 reads    of him  of what strength they are
a foot  what say you to that 


parolles

by my troth  sir  if i were to live this present
hour  i will tell true  let me see  spurio  a
hundred and fifty  sebastian  so many  corambus  so
many  jaques  so many  guiltian  cosmo  lodowick 
and gratii  two hundred and fifty each  mine own
company  chitopher  vaumond  bentii  two hundred and
fifty each  so that the muster file  rotten and
sound  upon my life  amounts not to fifteen thousand
poll  half of the which dare not shake snow from off
their cassocks  lest they shake themselves to pieces 


bertram

what shall be done to him 


first lord

nothing  but let him have thanks  demand of him my
condition  and what credit i have with the duke 


first soldier

well  that set down 
reads
 shall demand of him  whether one captain dumain
be i  the camp  a frenchman  what his reputation is
with the duke  what his valour  honesty  and
expertness in wars  or whether he thinks it were not
possible  with well weighing sums of gold  to
corrupt him to revolt  what say you to this  what
do you know of it 


parolles

i beseech you  let me answer to the particular of
the inter gatories  demand them singly 


first soldier

do you know this captain dumain 


parolles

i know him  a  was a botcher in paris 
from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve 
fool with child a dumb innocent  that could not
say him nay 


bertram

nay  by your leave  hold your hands  though i know
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls 


first soldier

well  is this captain in the duke of florence camp 


parolles

upon my knowledge  he is  and lousy 


first lord

nay look not so upon me  we shall hear of your
lordship anon 


first soldier

what is his reputation with the duke 


parolles

the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
of mine  and writ to me this other day to turn him
out o  the band  i think i have his letter in my pocket 


first soldier

marry  we search 


parolles

in good sadness  i do not know  either it is there 
or it is upon a file with the duke other letters
in my tent 


first soldier

here  tis  here a paper  shall i read it to you 


parolles

i do not know if it be it or no 


bertram

our interpreter does it well 


first lord

excellently 


first soldier

 reads    dian  the count a fool  and full of gold 


parolles

that is not the duke letter  sir  that is an
advertisement to a proper maid in florence  one
diana  to take heed of the allurement of one count
rousillon  a foolish idle boy  but for all that very
ruttish  i pray you  sir  put it up again 


first soldier

nay  i read it first  by your favour 


parolles

my meaning in t  i protest  was very honest in the
behalf of the maid  for i knew the young count to be
a dangerous and lascivious boy  who is a whale to
virginity and devours up all the fry it finds 


bertram

damnable both sides rogue 


first soldier

 reads    he swears oaths  bid him drop gold  and take it 
after he scores  he never pays the score 
half won is match well made  match  and well make it 
he ne pays after debts  take it before 
and say a soldier  dian  told thee this 
men are to mell with  boys are not to kiss 
for count of this  the count a fool  i know it 
who pays before  but not when he does owe it 
thine  as he vowed to thee in thine ear 
parolles 


bertram

he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
in forehead 


second lord

this is your devoted friend  sir  the manifold
linguist and the armipotent soldier 


bertram

i could endure any thing before but a cat  and now
he a cat to me 


first soldier

i perceive  sir  by the general looks  we shall be
fain to hang you 


parolles

my life  sir  in any case  not that i am afraid to
die  but that  my offences being many  i would
repent out the remainder of nature  let me live 
sir  in a dungeon  i  the stocks  or any where  so i may live 


first soldier

we see what may be done  so you confess freely 
therefore  once more to this captain dumain  you
have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
his valour  what is his honesty 


parolles

he will steal  sir  an egg out of a cloister  for
rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus  he
professes not keeping of oaths  in breaking  he
is stronger than hercules  he will lie  sir  with
such volubility  that you would think truth were a
fool  drunkenness is his best virtue  for he will
be swine drunk  and in his sleep he does little
harm  save to his bed clothes about him  but they
know his conditions and lay him in straw  i have but
little more to say  sir  of his honesty  he has
every thing that an honest man should not have  what
an honest man should have  he has nothing 


first lord

i begin to love him for this 


bertram

for this description of thine honesty  a pox upon
him for me  he more and more a cat 


first soldier

what say you to his expertness in war 


parolles

faith  sir  he has led the drum before the english
tragedians  to belie him  i will not  and more of
his soldiership i know not  except  in that country
he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
called mile end  to instruct for the doubling of
files  i would do the man what honour i can  but of
this i am not certain 


first lord

he hath out villained villany so far  that the
rarity redeems him 


bertram

a pox on him  he a cat still 


first soldier

his qualities being at this poor price  i need not
to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt 


parolles

sir  for a quart d he will sell the fee simple
of his salvation  the inheritance of it  and cut the
entail from all remainders  and a perpetual
succession for it perpetually 


first soldier

what his brother  the other captain dumain 


second lord

why does be ask him of me 


first soldier

what he 


parolles

e a crow o  the same nest  not altogether so
great as the first in goodness  but greater a great
deal in evil  he excels his brother for a coward 
yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is 
in a retreat he outruns any lackey  marry  in coming
on he has the cramp 


first soldier

if your life be saved  will you undertake to betray
the florentine 


parolles

ay  and the captain of his horse  count rousillon 


first soldier

i whisper with the general  and know his pleasure 


parolles

 aside   i no more drumming  a plague of all
drums  only to seem to deserve well  and to
beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
the count  have i run into this danger  yet who
would have suspected an ambush where i was taken 


first soldier

there is no remedy  sir  but you must die  the
general says  you that have so traitorously
discovered the secrets of your army and made such
pestiferous reports of men very nobly held  can
serve the world for no honest use  therefore you
must die  come  headsman  off with his head 


parolles

o lord  sir  let me live  or let me see my death 


first lord

that shall you  and take your leave of all your friends 
unblinding him
so  look about you  know you any here 


bertram

good morrow  noble captain 


second lord

god bless you  captain parolles 


first lord

god save you  noble captain 


second lord

captain  what greeting will you to my lord lafeu 
i am for france 


first lord

good captain  will you give me a copy of the sonnet
you writ to diana in behalf of the count rousillon 
an i were not a very coward  i compel it of you 
but fare you well 
exeunt bertram and lords


first soldier

you are undone  captain  all but your scarf  that
has a knot on yet


parolles

who cannot be crushed with a plot 


first soldier

if you could find out a country where but women were
that had received so much shame  you might begin an
impudent nation  fare ye well  sir  i am for france
too  we shall speak of you there 
exit with soldiers


parolles

yet am i thankful  if my heart were great 
 burst at this  captain i be no more 
but i will eat and drink  and sleep as soft
as captain shall  simply the thing i am
shall make me live  who knows himself a braggart 
let him fear this  for it will come to pass
that every braggart shall be found an ass 
rust  sword  cool  blushes  and  parolles  live
safest in shame  being fool d  by foolery thrive 
there place and means for every man alive 
i after them 
exit
