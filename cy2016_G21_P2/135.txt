scene iv  florence  the widow house 


enter helena  widow  and diana


helena

that you may well perceive i have not wrong you 
one of the greatest in the christian world
shall be my surety   whose throne  needful 
ere i can perfect mine intents  to kneel 
time was  i did him a desired office 
dear almost as his life  which gratitude
through flinty tartar bosom would peep forth 
and answer  thanks  i duly am inform 
his grace is at marseilles  to which place
we have convenient convoy  you must know
i am supposed dead  the army breaking 
my husband hies him home  where  heaven aiding 
and by the leave of my good lord the king 
we be before our welcome 


widow

gentle madam 
you never had a servant to whose trust
your business was more welcome 


helena

nor you  mistress 
ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
to recompense your love  doubt not but heaven
hath brought me up to be your daughter dower 
as it hath fated her to be my motive
and helper to a husband  but  o strange men 
that can such sweet use make of what they hate 
when saucy trusting of the cozen thoughts
defiles the pitchy night  so lust doth play
with what it loathes for that which is away 
but more of this hereafter  you  diana 
under my poor instructions yet must suffer
something in my behalf 


diana

let death and honesty
go with your impositions  i am yours
upon your will to suffer 


helena

yet  i pray you 
but with the word the time will bring on summer 
when briers shall have leaves as well as thorns 
and be as sweet as sharp  we must away 
our wagon is prepared  and time revives us 
all well that ends well  still the fine the crown 
whate the course  the end is the renown 
exeunt
