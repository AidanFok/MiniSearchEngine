scene v  rousillon  the count palace 


enter countess  lafeu  and clown


lafeu

no  no  no  your son was misled with a snipt taffeta
fellow there  whose villanous saffron would have
made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
his colour  your daughter in law had been alive at
this hour  and your son here at home  more advanced
by the king than by that red tailed humble bee i speak of 


countess

i would i had not known him  it was the death of the
most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
praise for creating  if she had partaken of my
flesh  and cost me the dearest groans of a mother  i
could not have owed her a more rooted love 


lafeu

 a good lady   a good lady  we may pick a
thousand salads ere we light on such another herb 


clown

indeed  sir  she was the sweet marjoram of the
salad  or rather  the herb of grace 


lafeu

they are not herbs  you knave  they are nose herbs 


clown

i am no great nebuchadnezzar  sir  i have not much
skill in grass 


lafeu

whether dost thou profess thyself  a knave or a fool 


clown

a fool  sir  at a woman service  and a knave at a man s 


lafeu

your distinction 


clown

i would cozen the man of his wife and do his service 


lafeu

so you were a knave at his service  indeed 


clown

and i would give his wife my bauble  sir  to do her service 


lafeu

i will subscribe for thee  thou art both knave and fool 


clown

at your service 


lafeu

no  no  no 


clown

why  sir  if i cannot serve you  i can serve as
great a prince as you are 


lafeu

who that  a frenchman 


clown

faith  sir  a  has an english name  but his fisnomy
is more hotter in france than there 


lafeu

what prince is that 


clown

the black prince  sir  alias  the prince of
darkness  alias  the devil 


lafeu

hold thee  there my purse  i give thee not this
to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of 
serve him still 


clown

i am a woodland fellow  sir  that always loved a
great fire  and the master i speak of ever keeps a
good fire  but  sure  he is the prince of the
world  let his nobility remain in court  i am for
the house with the narrow gate  which i take to be
too little for pomp to enter  some that humble
themselves may  but the many will be too chill and
tender  and they be for the flowery way that
leads to the broad gate and the great fire 


lafeu

go thy ways  i begin to be aweary of thee  and i
tell thee so before  because i would not fall out
with thee  go thy ways  let my horses be well
looked to  without any tricks 


clown

if i put any tricks upon  em  sir  they shall be
jades  tricks  which are their own right by the law of nature 
exit


lafeu

a shrewd knave and an unhappy 


countess

so he is  my lord that gone made himself much
sport out of him  by his authority he remains here 
which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness  and 
indeed  he has no pace  but runs where he will 


lafeu

i like him well   not amiss  and i was about to
tell you  since i heard of the good lady death and
that my lord your son was upon his return home  i
moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
my daughter  which  in the minority of them both 
his majesty  out of a self gracious remembrance  did
first propose  his highness hath promised me to do
it  and  to stop up the displeasure he hath
conceived against your son  there is no fitter
matter  how does your ladyship like it 


countess

with very much content  my lord  and i wish it
happily effected 


lafeu

his highness comes post from marseilles  of as able
body as when he numbered thirty  he will be here
to morrow  or i am deceived by him that in such
intelligence hath seldom failed 


countess

it rejoices me  that i hope i shall see him ere i
die  i have letters that my son will be here
to night  i shall beseech your lordship to remain
with me till they meet together 


lafeu

madam  i was thinking with what manners i might
safely be admitted 


countess

you need but plead your honourable privilege 


lafeu

lady  of that i have made a bold charter  but i
thank my god it holds yet 
re enter clown


clown

o madam  yonder my lord your son with a patch of
velvet on face  whether there be a scar under 
or no  the velvet knows  but  a goodly patch of
velvet  his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
half  but his right cheek is worn bare 


lafeu

a scar nobly got  or a noble scar  is a good livery
of honour  so belike is that 


clown

but it is your carbonadoed face 


lafeu

let us go see your son  i pray you  i long to talk
with the young noble soldier 


clown

faith there a dozen of  em  with delicate fine
hats and most courteous feathers  which bow the head
and nod at every man 
exeunt
