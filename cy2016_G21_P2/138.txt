cat but not a musk cat that has fallen into the
unclean fishpond of her displeasure  and  as he

carp as you may  for he looks like a poor  decayed 
ingenious  foolish  rascally knave  i do pity his
distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to
your lordship

thee in grace and the other brings thee out
