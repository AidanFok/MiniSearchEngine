scene iii  rousillon  the count palace 


flourish  enter king  countess  lafeu  the two french lords  with attendants


king

we lost a jewel of her  and our esteem
was made much poorer by it  but your son 
as mad in folly  lack the sense to know
her estimation home 


countess

 past  my liege 
and i beseech your majesty to make it
natural rebellion  done i  the blaze of youth 
when oil and fire  too strong for reason force 
o it and burns on 


king

my honour lady 
i have forgiven and forgotten all 
though my revenges were high bent upon him 
and watch the time to shoot 


lafeu

this i must say 
but first i beg my pardon  the young lord
did to his majesty  his mother and his lady
offence of mighty note  but to himself
the greatest wrong of all  he lost a wife
whose beauty did astonish the survey
of richest eyes  whose words all ears took captive 
whose dear perfection hearts that scorn to serve
humbly call mistress 


king

praising what is lost
makes the remembrance dear  well  call him hither 
we are reconciled  and the first view shall kill
all repetition  let him not ask our pardon 
the nature of his great offence is dead 
and deeper than oblivion we do bury
the incensing relics of it  let him approach 
a stranger  no offender  and inform him
so  our will he should 


gentleman

i shall  my liege 
exit


king

what says he to your daughter  have you spoke 


lafeu

all that he is hath reference to your highness 


king

then shall we have a match  i have letters sent me
that set him high in fame 
enter bertram


lafeu

he looks well on t 


king

i am not a day of season 
for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
in me at once  but to the brightest beams
distracted clouds give way  so stand thou forth 
the time is fair again 


bertram

my high repented blames 
dear sovereign  pardon to me 


king

all is whole 
not one word more of the consumed time 
let take the instant by the forward top 
for we are old  and on our quick decrees
the inaudible and noiseless foot of time
steals ere we can effect them  you remember
the daughter of this lord 


bertram

admiringly  my liege  at first
i stuck my choice upon her  ere my heart
durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
where the impression of mine eye infixing 
contempt his scornful perspective did lend me 
which warp the line of every other favour 
scorn a fair colour  or express it stolen 
extended or contracted all proportions
to a most hideous object  thence it came
that she whom all men praised and whom myself 
since i have lost  have loved  was in mine eye
the dust that did offend it 


king

well excused 
that thou didst love her  strikes some scores away
from the great compt  but love that comes too late 
like a remorseful pardon slowly carried 
to the great sender turns a sour offence 
crying   that good that gone  our rash faults
make trivial price of serious things we have 
not knowing them until we know their grave 
oft our displeasures  to ourselves unjust 
destroy our friends and after weep their dust
our own love waking cries to see what done 
while shame full late sleeps out the afternoon 
be this sweet helen knell  and now forget her 
send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin 
the main consents are had  and here we stay
to see our widower second marriage day 


countess

which better than the first  o dear heaven  bless 
or  ere they meet  in me  o nature  cesse 


lafeu

come on  my son  in whom my house name
must be digested  give a favour from you
to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter 
that she may quickly come 
bertram gives a ring
by my old beard 
and every hair that on t  helen  that dead 
was a sweet creature  such a ring as this 
the last that e i took her at court 
i saw upon her finger 


bertram

hers it was not 


king

now  pray you  let me see it  for mine eye 
while i was speaking  oft was fasten to t 
this ring was mine  and  when i gave it helen 
i bade her  if her fortunes ever stood
necessitied to help  that by this token
i would relieve her  had you that craft  to reave
her
of what should stead her most 


bertram

my gracious sovereign 
howe it pleases you to take it so 
the ring was never hers 


countess

son  on my life 
i have seen her wear it  and she reckon it
at her life rate 


lafeu

i am sure i saw her wear it 


bertram

you are deceived  my lord  she never saw it 
in florence was it from a casement thrown me 
wrapp in a paper  which contain the name
of her that threw it  noble she was  and thought
i stood engaged  but when i had subscribed
to mine own fortune and inform her fully
i could not answer in that course of honour
as she had made the overture  she ceased
in heavy satisfaction and would never
receive the ring again 


king

plutus himself 
that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine 
hath not in nature mystery more science
than i have in this ring   mine   helen s 
whoever gave it you  then  if you know
that you are well acquainted with yourself 
confess  hers  and by what rough enforcement
you got it from her  she call the saints to surety
that she would never put it from her finger 
unless she gave it to yourself in bed 
where you have never come  or sent it us
upon her great disaster 


bertram

she never saw it 


king

thou speak it falsely  as i love mine honour 
and makest conjectural fears to come into me
which i would fain shut out  if it should prove
that thou art so inhuman not prove so 
and yet i know not  thou didst hate her deadly 
and she is dead  which nothing  but to close
her eyes myself  could win me to believe 
more than to see this ring  take him away 
guards seize bertram
my fore past proofs  howe the matter fall 
shall tax my fears of little vanity 
having vainly fear too little  away with him 
we sift this matter further 


bertram

if you shall prove
this ring was ever hers  you shall as easy
prove that i husbanded her bed in florence 
where yet she never was 
exit  guarded


king

i am wrapp in dismal thinkings 
enter a gentleman


gentleman

gracious sovereign 
whether i have been to blame or no  i know not 
here a petition from a florentine 
who hath for four or five removes come short
to tender it herself  i undertook it 
vanquish thereto by the fair grace and speech
of the poor suppliant  who by this i know
is here attending  her business looks in her
with an importing visage  and she told me 
in a sweet verbal brief  it did concern
your highness with herself 


king

 reads   upon his many protestations to marry me
when his wife was dead  i blush to say it  he won
me  now is the count rousillon a widower  his vows
are forfeited to me  and my honour paid to him  he
stole from florence  taking no leave  and i follow
him to his country for justice  grant it me  o
king  in you it best lies  otherwise a seducer
flourishes  and a poor maid is undone 
diana capilet 


lafeu

i will buy me a son in law in a fair  and toll for
this  i none of him 


king

the heavens have thought well on thee lafeu 
to bring forth this discovery  seek these suitors 
go speedily and bring again the count 
i am afeard the life of helen  lady 
was foully snatch d 


countess

now  justice on the doers 
re enter bertram  guarded


king

i wonder  sir  sith wives are monsters to you 
and that you fly them as you swear them lordship 
yet you desire to marry 
enter widow and diana
what woman that 


diana

i am  my lord  a wretched florentine 
derived from the ancient capilet 
my suit  as i do understand  you know 
and therefore know how far i may be pitied 


widow

i am her mother  sir  whose age and honour
both suffer under this complaint we bring 
and both shall cease  without your remedy 


king

come hither  count  do you know these women 


bertram

my lord  i neither can nor will deny
but that i know them  do they charge me further 


diana

why do you look so strange upon your wife 


bertram

she none of mine  my lord 


diana

if you shall marry 
you give away this hand  and that is mine 
you give away heaven vows  and those are mine 
you give away myself  which is known mine 
for i by vow am so embodied yours 
that she which marries you must marry me 
either both or none 


lafeu

your reputation comes too short for my daughter  you
are no husband for her 


bertram

my lord  this is a fond and desperate creature 
whom sometime i have laugh with  let your highness
lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
than for to think that i would sink it here 


king

sir  for my thoughts  you have them ill to friend
till your deeds gain them  fairer prove your honour
than in my thought it lies 


diana

good my lord 
ask him upon his oath  if he does think
he had not my virginity 


king

what say thou to her 


bertram

she impudent  my lord 
and was a common gamester to the camp 


diana

he does me wrong  my lord  if i were so 
he might have bought me at a common price 
do not believe him  o  behold this ring 
whose high respect and rich validity
did lack a parallel  yet for all that
he gave it to a commoner o  the camp 
if i be one 


countess

                  he blushes  and  it 
of six preceding ancestors  that gem 
conferr by testament to the sequent issue 
hath it been owed and worn  this is his wife 
that ring a thousand proofs 


king

methought you said
you saw one here in court could witness it 


diana

i did  my lord  but loath am to produce
so bad an instrument  his name parolles 


lafeu

i saw the man to day  if man he be 


king

find him  and bring him hither 
exit an attendant


bertram

what of him 
he quoted for a most perfidious slave 
with all the spots o  the world tax and debosh d 
whose nature sickens but to speak a truth 
am i or that or this for what he utter 
that will speak any thing 


king

she hath that ring of yours 


bertram

i think she has  certain it is i liked her 
and boarded her i  the wanton way of youth 
she knew her distance and did angle for me 
madding my eagerness with her restraint 
as all impediments in fancy course
are motives of more fancy  and  in fine 
her infinite cunning  with her modern grace 
subdued me to her rate  she got the ring 
and i had that which any inferior might
at market price have bought 


diana

i must be patient 
you  that have turn off a first so noble wife 
may justly diet me  i pray you yet 
since you lack virtue  i will lose a husband 
send for your ring  i will return it home 
and give me mine again 


bertram

i have it not 


king

what ring was yours  i pray you 


diana

sir  much like
the same upon your finger 


king

know you this ring  this ring was his of late 


diana

and this was it i gave him  being abed 


king

the story then goes false  you threw it him
out of a casement 


diana

                  i have spoke the truth 
enter parolles


bertram

my lord  i do confess the ring was hers 


king

you boggle shrewdly  every feather stars you 
is this the man you speak of 


diana

ay  my lord 


king

tell me  sirrah  but tell me true  i charge you 
not fearing the displeasure of your master 
which on your just proceeding i keep off 
by him and by this woman here what know you 


parolles

so please your majesty  my master hath been an
honourable gentleman  tricks he hath had in him 
which gentlemen have 


king

come  come  to the purpose  did he love this woman 


parolles

faith  sir  he did love her  but how 


king

how  i pray you 


parolles

he did love her  sir  as a gentleman loves a woman 


king

how is that 


parolles

he loved her  sir  and loved her not 


king

as thou art a knave  and no knave  what an
equivocal companion is this 


parolles

i am a poor man  and at your majesty command 


lafeu

he a good drum  my lord  but a naughty orator 


diana

do you know he promised me marriage 


parolles

faith  i know more than i speak 


king

but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest 


parolles

yes  so please your majesty  i did go between them 
as i said  but more than that  he loved her  for
indeed he was mad for her  and talked of satan and
of limbo and of furies and i know not what  yet i
was in that credit with them at that time that i
knew of their going to bed  and of other motions 
as promising her marriage  and things which would
derive me ill will to speak of  therefore i will not
speak what i know 


king

thou hast spoken all already  unless thou canst say
they are married  but thou art too fine in thy
evidence  therefore stand aside 
this ring  you say  was yours 


diana

ay  my good lord 


king

where did you buy it  or who gave it you 


diana

it was not given me  nor i did not buy it 


king

who lent it you 


diana

                  it was not lent me neither 


king

where did you find it  then 


diana

i found it not 


king

if it were yours by none of all these ways 
how could you give it him 


diana

i never gave it him 


lafeu

this woman an easy glove  my lord  she goes off
and on at pleasure 


king

this ring was mine  i gave it his first wife 


diana

it might be yours or hers  for aught i know 


king

take her away  i do not like her now 
to prison with her  and away with him 
unless thou tell me where thou hadst this ring 
thou diest within this hour 


diana

i never tell you 


king

take her away 


diana

                  i put in bail  my liege 


king

i think thee now some common customer 


diana

by jove  if ever i knew man   you 


king

wherefore hast thou accused him all this while 


diana

because he guilty  and he is not guilty 
he knows i am no maid  and he swear to t 
i swear i am a maid  and he knows not 
great king  i am no strumpet  by my life 
i am either maid  or else this old man wife 


king

she does abuse our ears  to prison with her 


diana

good mother  fetch my bail  stay  royal sir 
exit widow
the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for 
and he shall surety me  but for this lord 
who hath abused me  as he knows himself 
though yet he never harm me  here i quit him 
he knows himself my bed he hath defiled 
and at that time he got his wife with child 
dead though she be  she feels her young one kick 
so there my riddle  one that dead is quick 
and now behold the meaning 
re enter widow  with helena


king

is there no exorcist
beguiles the truer office of mine eyes 
is real that i see 


helena

no  my good lord 
 but the shadow of a wife you see 
the name and not the thing 


bertram

both  both  o  pardon 


helena

o my good lord  when i was like this maid 
i found you wondrous kind  there is your ring 
and  look you  here your letter  this it says 
 from my finger you can get this ring
and are by me with child     c  this is done 
will you be mine  now you are doubly won 


bertram

if she  my liege  can make me know this clearly 
i love her dearly  ever  ever dearly 


helena

if it appear not plain and prove untrue 
deadly divorce step between me and you 
o my dear mother  do i see you living 


lafeu

mine eyes smell onions  i shall weep anon 
to parolles
good tom drum  lend me a handkercher  so 
i thank thee  wait on me home  i make sport with thee 
let thy courtesies alone  they are scurvy ones 


king

let us from point to point this story know 
to make the even truth in pleasure flow 
to diana
if thou be yet a fresh uncropped flower 
choose thou thy husband  and i pay thy dower 
for i can guess that by thy honest aid
thou keep a wife herself  thyself a maid 
of that and all the progress  more or less 
resolvedly more leisure shall express 
all yet seems well  and if it end so meet 
the bitter past  more welcome is the sweet 
flourish
epilogue


king

the king a beggar  now the play is done 
all is well ended  if this suit be won 
that you express content  which we will pay 
with strife to please you  day exceeding day 
ours be your patience then  and yours our parts 
your gentle hands lend us  and take our hearts 
exeunt
