earl of worcester

o  no  my nephew must not know  sir richard 
the liberal and kind offer of the king 


vernon

 best he did 


earl of worcester

then are we all undone 
it is not possible  it cannot be 
the king should keep his word in loving us 
he will suspect us still and find a time
to punish this offence in other faults 
suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes 
for treason is but trusted like the fox 
who  ne so tame  so cherish and lock up 
will have a wild trick of his ancestors 
look how we can  or sad or merrily 
interpretation will misquote our looks 
and we shall feed like oxen at a stall 
the better cherish d  still the nearer death 
my nephew trespass may be well forgot 
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood 
and an adopted name of privilege 
a hair brain hotspur  govern by a spleen 
all his offences live upon my head
and on his father s  we did train him on 
and  his corruption being ta from us 
we  as the spring of all  shall pay for all 
therefore  good cousin  let not harry know 
in any case  the offer of the king 


vernon

deliver what you will  i say  so 
here comes your cousin 
enter hotspur and douglas


hotspur

my uncle is return d 
deliver up my lord of westmoreland 
uncle  what news 


earl of worcester

earl of douglas

defy him by the lord of westmoreland 


hotspur

lord douglas  go you and tell him so 


earl of douglas

marry  and shall  and very willingly 
exit


earl of worcester

there is no seeming mercy in the king 


hotspur

did you beg any  god forbid 


earl of worcester

i told him gently of our grievances 
of his oath breaking  which he mended thus 
by now forswearing that he is forsworn 
he calls us rebels  traitors  and will scourge
with haughty arms this hateful name in us 
re enter the earl of douglas


earl of douglas

arm  gentlemen  to arms  for i have thrown
a brave defiance in king henry teeth 
and westmoreland  that was engaged  did bear it 
which cannot choose but bring him quickly on 


earl of worcester

the prince of wales stepp forth before the king 
and  nephew  challenged you to single fight 


hotspur

o  would the quarrel lay upon our heads 
and that no man might draw short breath today
but i and harry monmouth  tell me  tell me 
how show his tasking  seem it in contempt 


vernon

no  by my soul  i never in my life
did hear a challenge urged more modestly 
unless a brother should a brother dare
to gentle exercise and proof of arms 
he gave you all the duties of a man 
trimm up your praises with a princely tongue 
spoke to your deservings like a chronicle 
making you ever better than his praise
by still dispraising praise valued in you 
and  which became him like a prince indeed 
he made a blushing cital of himself 
and chid his truant youth with such a grace
as if he master there a double spirit 
of teaching and of learning instantly 
there did he pause  but let me tell the world 
if he outlive the envy of this day 
england did never owe so sweet a hope 
so much misconstrued in his wantonness 


hotspur

cousin  i think thou art enamoured
on his follies  never did i hear
of any prince so wild a libertine 
but be he as he will  yet once ere night
i will embrace him with a soldier arm 
that he shall shrink under my courtesy 
arm  arm with speed  and  fellows  soldiers  friends 
better consider what you have to do
than i  that have not well the gift of tongue 
can lift your blood up with persuasion 
enter a messenger


messenger

my lord  here are letters for you 


hotspur

i cannot read them now 
o gentlemen  the time of life is short 
to spend that shortness basely were too long 
if life did ride upon a dial point 
still ending at the arrival of an hour 
an if we live  we live to tread on kings 
if die  brave death  when princes die with us 
now  for our consciences  the arms are fair 
when the intent of bearing them is just 
enter another messenger


messenger

my lord  prepare  the king comes on apace 


hotspur

i thank him  that he cuts me from my tale 
for i profess not talking  only this 
let each man do his best  and here draw i
a sword  whose temper i intend to stain
with the best blood that i can meet withal
in the adventure of this perilous day 
now  esperance  percy  and set on 
sound all the lofty instruments of war 
and by that music let us all embrace 
for  heaven to earth  some of us never shall
a second time do such a courtesy 
the trumpets sound  they embrace  and exeunt
