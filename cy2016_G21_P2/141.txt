scene ii  lawn before the duke palace 


enter celia and rosalind


celia

i pray thee  rosalind  sweet my coz  be merry 


rosalind

dear celia  i show more mirth than i am mistress of 
and would you yet i were merrier  unless you could
teach me to forget a banished father  you must not
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure 


celia

herein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight
that i love thee  if my uncle  thy banished father 
had banished thy uncle  the duke my father  so thou
hadst been still with me  i could have taught my
love to take thy father for mine  so wouldst thou 
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee 


rosalind

well  i will forget the condition of my estate  to
rejoice in yours 


celia

you know my father hath no child but i  nor none is
like to have  and  truly  when he dies  thou shalt
be his heir  for what he hath taken away from thy
father perforce  i will render thee again in
affection  by mine honour  i will  and when i break
that oath  let me turn monster  therefore  my
sweet rose  my dear rose  be merry 


rosalind

from henceforth i will  coz  and devise sports  let
me see  what think you of falling in love 


celia

marry  i prithee  do  to make sport withal  but
love no man in good earnest  nor no further in sport
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
in honour come off again 


rosalind

what shall be our sport  then 


celia

let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from
her wheel  that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally 


rosalind

i would we could do so  for her benefits are
mightily misplaced  and the bountiful blind woman
doth most mistake in her gifts to women 


celia

 true  for those that she makes fair she scarce
makes honest  and those that she makes honest she
makes very ill favouredly 


rosalind

nay  now thou goest from fortune office to
nature s  fortune reigns in gifts of the world 
not in the lineaments of nature 
enter touchstone


celia

no  when nature hath made a fair creature  may she
not by fortune fall into the fire  though nature
hath given us wit to flout at fortune  hath not
fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument 


rosalind

indeed  there is fortune too hard for nature  when
fortune makes nature natural the cutter off of
nature wit 


celia

peradventure this is not fortune work neither  but
nature s  who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
natural for our whetstone  for always the dulness of
the fool is the whetstone of the wits  how now 
wit  whither wander you 


touchstone

mistress  you must come away to your father 


celia

were you made the messenger 


touchstone

no  by mine honour  but i was bid to come for you 


rosalind

where learned you that oath  fool 


touchstone

of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
mustard was naught  now i stand to it  the
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good  and
yet was not the knight forsworn 


celia

how prove you that  in the great heap of your
knowledge 


rosalind

ay  marry  now unmuzzle your wisdom 


touchstone

stand you both forth now  stroke your chins  and
swear by your beards that i am a knave 


celia

by our beards  if we had them  thou art 


touchstone

by my knavery  if i had it  then i were  but if you
swear by that that is not  you are not forsworn  no
more was this knight swearing by his honour  for he
never had any  or if he had  he had sworn it away
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard 


celia

prithee  who is that thou meanest 


touchstone

one that old frederick  your father  loves 


celia

my father love is enough to honour him  enough 
speak no more of him  you be whipped for taxation
one of these days 


touchstone

the more pity  that fools may not speak wisely what
wise men do foolishly 


celia

by my troth  thou sayest true  for since the little
wit that fools have was silenced  the little foolery
that wise men have makes a great show  here comes
monsieur le beau 


rosalind

with his mouth full of news 


celia

which he will put on us  as pigeons feed their young 


rosalind

then shall we be news crammed 


celia

all the better  we shall be the more marketable 
enter le beau
bon jour  monsieur le beau  what the news 


le beau

fair princess  you have lost much good sport 


celia

sport  of what colour 


le beau

what colour  madam  how shall i answer you 


rosalind

as wit and fortune will 


touchstone

or as the destinies decree 


celia

well said  that was laid on with a trowel 


touchstone

nay  if i keep not my rank 


rosalind

thou losest thy old smell 


le beau

you amaze me  ladies  i would have told you of good
wrestling  which you have lost the sight of 


rosalind

you tell us the manner of the wrestling 


le beau

i will tell you the beginning  and  if it please
your ladyships  you may see the end  for the best is
yet to do  and here  where you are  they are coming
to perform it 


celia

well  the beginning  that is dead and buried 


le beau

there comes an old man and his three sons 


celia

i could match this beginning with an old tale 


le beau

three proper young men  of excellent growth and presence 


rosalind

with bills on their necks   it known unto all men
by these presents 


le beau

the eldest of the three wrestled with charles  the
duke wrestler  which charles in a moment threw him
and broke three of his ribs  that there is little
hope of life in him  so he served the second  and
so the third  yonder they lie  the poor old man 
their father  making such pitiful dole over them
that all the beholders take his part with weeping 


rosalind

alas 


touchstone

but what is the sport  monsieur  that the ladies
have lost 


le beau

why  this that i speak of 


touchstone

thus men may grow wiser every day  it is the first
time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport
for ladies 


celia

or i  i promise thee 


rosalind

but is there any else longs to see this broken music
in his sides  is there yet another dotes upon
rib breaking  shall we see this wrestling  cousin 


le beau

you must  if you stay here  for here is the place
appointed for the wrestling  and they are ready to
perform it 


celia

yonder  sure  they are coming  let us now stay and see it 
flourish  enter duke frederick  lords  orlando  charles  and attendants


duke frederick

come on  since the youth will not be entreated  his
own peril on his forwardness 


rosalind

is yonder the man 


le beau

even he  madam 


celia

alas  he is too young  yet he looks successfully 


duke frederick

how now  daughter and cousin  are you crept hither
to see the wrestling 


rosalind

ay  my liege  so please you give us leave 


duke frederick

you will take little delight in it  i can tell you 
there is such odds in the man  in pity of the
challenger youth i would fain dissuade him  but he
will not be entreated  speak to him  ladies  see if
you can move him 


celia

call him hither  good monsieur le beau 


duke frederick

do so  i not be by 


le beau

monsieur the challenger  the princesses call for you 


orlando

i attend them with all respect and duty 


rosalind

young man  have you challenged charles the wrestler 


orlando

no  fair princess  he is the general challenger  i
come but in  as others do  to try with him the
strength of my youth 


celia

young gentleman  your spirits are too bold for your
years  you have seen cruel proof of this man 
strength  if you saw yourself with your eyes or
knew yourself with your judgment  the fear of your
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise  we pray you  for your own sake  to
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt 


rosalind

do  young sir  your reputation shall not therefore
be misprised  we will make it our suit to the duke
that the wrestling might not go forward 


orlando

i beseech you  punish me not with your hard
thoughts  wherein i confess me much guilty  to deny
so fair and excellent ladies any thing  but let
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
trial  wherein if i be foiled  there is but one
shamed that was never gracious  if killed  but one
dead that was willing to be so  i shall do my
friends no wrong  for i have none to lament me  the
world no injury  for in it i have nothing  only in
the world i fill up a place  which may be better
supplied when i have made it empty 


rosalind

the little strength that i have  i would it were with you 


celia

and mine  to eke out hers 


rosalind

fare you well  pray heaven i be deceived in you 


celia

your heart desires be with you 


charles

come  where is this young gallant that is so
desirous to lie with his mother earth 


orlando

ready  sir  but his will hath in it a more modest working 


duke frederick

you shall try but one fall 


charles

no  i warrant your grace  you shall not entreat him
to a second  that have so mightily persuaded him
from a first 


orlando

an you mean to mock me after  you should not have
mocked me before  but come your ways 


rosalind

now hercules be thy speed  young man 


celia

i would i were invisible  to catch the strong
fellow by the leg 
they wrestle


rosalind

o excellent young man 


celia

if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye  i can tell who
should down 
shout  charles is thrown


duke frederick

no more  no more 


orlando

yes  i beseech your grace  i am not yet well breathed 


duke frederick

how dost thou  charles 


le beau

he cannot speak  my lord 


duke frederick

bear him away  what is thy name  young man 


orlando

orlando  my liege  the youngest son of sir rowland de boys 


duke frederick

i would thou hadst been son to some man else 
the world esteem thy father honourable 
but i did find him still mine enemy 
thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed 
hadst thou descended from another house 
but fare thee well  thou art a gallant youth 
i would thou hadst told me of another father 
exeunt duke frederick  train  and le beau


celia

were i my father  coz  would i do this 


orlando

i am more proud to be sir rowland son 
his youngest son  and would not change that calling 
to be adopted heir to frederick 


rosalind

my father loved sir rowland as his soul 
and all the world was of my father mind 
had i before known this young man his son 
i should have given him tears unto entreaties 
ere he should thus have ventured 


celia

gentle cousin 
let us go thank him and encourage him 
my father rough and envious disposition
sticks me at heart  sir  you have well deserved 
if you do keep your promises in love
but justly  as you have exceeded all promise 
your mistress shall be happy 


rosalind

gentleman 
giving him a chain from her neck
wear this for me  one out of suits with fortune 
that could give more  but that her hand lacks means 
shall we go  coz 


celia

                  ay  fare you well  fair gentleman 


orlando

can i not say  i thank you  my better parts
are all thrown down  and that which here stands up
is but a quintain  a mere lifeless block 


rosalind

he calls us back  my pride fell with my fortunes 
i ask him what he would  did you call  sir 
sir  you have wrestled well and overthrown
more than your enemies 


celia

will you go  coz 


rosalind

have with you  fare you well 
exeunt rosalind and celia


orlando

what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue 
i cannot speak to her  yet she urged conference 
o poor orlando  thou art overthrown 
or charles or something weaker masters thee 
re enter le beau


le beau

good sir  i do in friendship counsel you
to leave this place  albeit you have deserved
high commendation  true applause and love 
yet such is now the duke condition
that he misconstrues all that you have done 
the duke is humorous  what he is indeed 
more suits you to conceive than i to speak of 


orlando

i thank you  sir  and  pray you  tell me this 
which of the two was daughter of the duke
that here was at the wrestling 


le beau

neither his daughter  if we judge by manners 
but yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
the other is daughter to the banish duke 
and here detain by her usurping uncle 
to keep his daughter company  whose loves
are dearer than the natural bond of sisters 
but i can tell you that of late this duke
hath ta displeasure  his gentle niece 
grounded upon no other argument
but that the people praise her for her virtues
and pity her for her good father sake 
and  on my life  his malice  the lady
will suddenly break forth  sir  fare you well 
hereafter  in a better world than this 
i shall desire more love and knowledge of you 


orlando

i rest much bounden to you  fare you well 
exit le beau
thus must i from the smoke into the smother 
from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother 
but heavenly rosalind 
exit
