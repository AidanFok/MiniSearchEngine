scene iii  a room in the palace 


enter celia and rosalind


celia

why  cousin  why  rosalind  cupid have mercy  not a word 


rosalind

not one to throw at a dog 


celia

no  thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
curs  throw some of them at me  come  lame me with reasons 


rosalind

then there were two cousins laid up  when the one
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
without any 


celia

but is all this for your father 


rosalind

no  some of it is for my child father  o  how
full of briers is this working day world 


celia

they are but burs  cousin  thrown upon thee in
holiday foolery  if we walk not in the trodden
paths our very petticoats will catch them 


rosalind

i could shake them off my coat  these burs are in my heart 


celia

hem them away 


rosalind

i would try  if i could cry  hem  and have him 


celia

come  come  wrestle with thy affections 


rosalind

o  they take the part of a better wrestler than myself 


celia

o  a good wish upon you  you will try in time  in
despite of a fall  but  turning these jests out of
service  let us talk in good earnest  is it
possible  on such a sudden  you should fall into so
strong a liking with old sir rowland youngest son 


rosalind

the duke my father loved his father dearly 


celia

doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
dearly  by this kind of chase  i should hate him 
for my father hated his father dearly  yet i hate
not orlando 


rosalind

no  faith  hate him not  for my sake 


celia

why should i not  doth he not deserve well 


rosalind

let me love him for that  and do you love him
because i do  look  here comes the duke 


celia

with his eyes full of anger 
enter duke frederick  with lords


duke frederick

mistress  dispatch you with your safest haste
and get you from our court 


rosalind

me  uncle 


duke frederick

you  cousin
within these ten days if that thou be found
so near our public court as twenty miles 
thou diest for it 


rosalind

                  i do beseech your grace 
let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me 
if with myself i hold intelligence
or have acquaintance with mine own desires 
if that i do not dream or be not frantic 
as i do trust i am not then  dear uncle 
never so much as in a thought unborn
did i offend your highness 


duke frederick

thus do all traitors 
if their purgation did consist in words 
they are as innocent as grace itself 
let it suffice thee that i trust thee not 


rosalind

yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor 
tell me whereon the likelihood depends 


duke frederick

thou art thy father daughter  there enough 


rosalind

so was i when your highness took his dukedom 
so was i when your highness banish him 
treason is not inherited  my lord 
or  if we did derive it from our friends 
what that to me  my father was no traitor 
then  good my liege  mistake me not so much
to think my poverty is treacherous 


celia

dear sovereign  hear me speak 


duke frederick

ay  celia  we stay her for your sake 
else had she with her father ranged along 


celia

i did not then entreat to have her stay 
it was your pleasure and your own remorse 
i was too young that time to value her 
but now i know her  if she be a traitor 
why so am i  we still have slept together 
rose at an instant  learn d  play d  eat together 
and wheresoever we went  like juno swans 
still we went coupled and inseparable 


duke frederick

she is too subtle for thee  and her smoothness 
her very silence and her patience
speak to the people  and they pity her 
thou art a fool  she robs thee of thy name 
and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
when she is gone  then open not thy lips 
firm and irrevocable is my doom
which i have pass upon her  she is banish d 


celia

pronounce that sentence then on me  my liege 
i cannot live out of her company 


duke frederick

you are a fool  you  niece  provide yourself 
if you outstay the time  upon mine honour 
and in the greatness of my word  you die 
exeunt duke frederick and lords


celia

o my poor rosalind  whither wilt thou go 
wilt thou change fathers  i will give thee mine 
i charge thee  be not thou more grieved than i am 


rosalind

i have more cause 


celia

                  thou hast not  cousin 
prithee be cheerful  know thou not  the duke
hath banish me  his daughter 


rosalind

that he hath not 


celia

no  hath not  rosalind lacks then the love
which teacheth thee that thou and i am one 
shall we be sunder d  shall we part  sweet girl 
no  let my father seek another heir 
therefore devise with me how we may fly 
whither to go and what to bear with us 
and do not seek to take your change upon you 
to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out 
for  by this heaven  now at our sorrows pale 
say what thou canst  i go along with thee 


rosalind

why  whither shall we go 


celia

to seek my uncle in the forest of arden 


rosalind

alas  what danger will it be to us 
maids as we are  to travel forth so far 
beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold 


celia

i put myself in poor and mean attire
and with a kind of umber smirch my face 
the like do you  so shall we pass along
and never stir assailants 


rosalind

were it not better 
because that i am more than common tall 
that i did suit me all points like a man 
a gallant curtle axe upon my thigh 
a boar spear in my hand  and in my heart
lie there what hidden woman fear there will 
we have a swashing and a martial outside 
as many other mannish cowards have
that do outface it with their semblances 


celia

what shall i call thee when thou art a man 


rosalind

i have no worse a name than jove own page 
and therefore look you call me ganymede 
but what will you be call d 


celia

something that hath a reference to my state
no longer celia  but aliena 


rosalind

but  cousin  what if we assay to steal
the clownish fool out of your father court 
would he not be a comfort to our travel 


celia

he go along o the wide world with me 
leave me alone to woo him  let away 
and get our jewels and our wealth together 
devise the fittest time and safest way
to hide us from pursuit that will be made
after my flight  now go we in content
to liberty and not to banishment 
exeunt
