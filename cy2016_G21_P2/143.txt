scene i  the forest of arden 


enter duke senior  amiens  and two or three lords  like foresters


duke senior

now  my co mates and brothers in exile 
hath not old custom made this life more sweet
than that of painted pomp  are not these woods
more free from peril than the envious court 
here feel we but the penalty of adam 
the seasons  difference  as the icy fang
and churlish chiding of the winter wind 
which  when it bites and blows upon my body 
even till i shrink with cold  i smile and say
 is no flattery  these are counsellors
that feelingly persuade me what i am 
sweet are the uses of adversity 
which  like the toad  ugly and venomous 
wears yet a precious jewel in his head 
and this our life exempt from public haunt
finds tongues in trees  books in the running brooks 
sermons in stones and good in every thing 
i would not change it 


amiens

happy is your grace 
that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
into so quiet and so sweet a style 


duke senior

come  shall we go and kill us venison 
and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools 
being native burghers of this desert city 
should in their own confines with forked heads
have their round haunches gored 


first lord

indeed  my lord 
the melancholy jaques grieves at that 
and  in that kind  swears you do more usurp
than doth your brother that hath banish you 
to day my lord of amiens and myself
did steal behind him as he lay along
under an oak whose antique root peeps out
upon the brook that brawls along this wood 
to the which place a poor sequester stag 
that from the hunter aim had ta a hurt 
did come to languish  and indeed  my lord 
the wretched animal heaved forth such groans
that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
almost to bursting  and the big round tears
coursed one another down his innocent nose
in piteous chase  and thus the hairy fool
much marked of the melancholy jaques 
stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook 
augmenting it with tears 


duke senior

but what said jaques 
did he not moralize this spectacle 


first lord

o  yes  into a thousand similes 
first  for his weeping into the needless stream 
 deer  quoth he   makest a testament
as worldlings do  giving thy sum of more
to that which had too much  then  being there alone 
left and abandon of his velvet friends 
 right  quoth he   misery doth part
the flux of company  anon a careless herd 
full of the pasture  jumps along by him
and never stays to greet him   ay  quoth jaques 
 on  you fat and greasy citizens 
 just the fashion  wherefore do you look
upon that poor and broken bankrupt there 
thus most invectively he pierceth through
the body of the country  city  court 
yea  and of this our life  swearing that we
are mere usurpers  tyrants and what worse 
to fright the animals and to kill them up
in their assign and native dwelling place 


duke senior

and did you leave him in this contemplation 


second lord

we did  my lord  weeping and commenting
upon the sobbing deer 


duke senior

show me the place 
i love to cope him in these sullen fits 
for then he full of matter 


first lord

i bring you to him straight 
exeunt
