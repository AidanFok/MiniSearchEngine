scene iv  the forest of arden 


enter rosalind for ganymede  celia for aliena  and touchstone


rosalind

o jupiter  how weary are my spirits 


touchstone

i care not for my spirits  if my legs were not weary 


rosalind

i could find in my heart to disgrace my man 
apparel and to cry like a woman  but i must comfort
the weaker vessel  as doublet and hose ought to show
itself courageous to petticoat  therefore courage 
good aliena 


celia

i pray you  bear with me  i cannot go no further 


touchstone

for my part  i had rather bear with you than bear
you  yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you 
for i think you have no money in your purse 


rosalind

well  this is the forest of arden 


touchstone

ay  now am i in arden  the more fool i  when i was
at home  i was in a better place  but travellers
must be content 


rosalind

ay  be so  good touchstone 
enter corin and silvius
look you  who comes here  a young man and an old in
solemn talk 


corin

that is the way to make her scorn you still 


silvius

o corin  that thou knew how i do love her 


corin

i partly guess  for i have loved ere now 


silvius

no  corin  being old  thou canst not guess 
though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
as ever sigh upon a midnight pillow 
but if thy love were ever like to mine 
as sure i think did never man love so 
how many actions most ridiculous
hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy 


corin

into a thousand that i have forgotten 


silvius

o  thou didst then ne love so heartily 
if thou remember not the slightest folly
that ever love did make thee run into 
thou hast not loved 
or if thou hast not sat as i do now 
wearying thy hearer in thy mistress  praise 
thou hast not loved 
or if thou hast not broke from company
abruptly  as my passion now makes me 
thou hast not loved 
o phebe  phebe  phebe 
exit


rosalind

alas  poor shepherd  searching of thy wound 
i have by hard adventure found mine own 


touchstone

and i mine  i remember  when i was in love i broke
my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
coming a night to jane smile  and i remember the
kissing of her batlet and the cow dugs that her
pretty chopt hands had milked  and i remember the
wooing of a peascod instead of her  from whom i took
two cods and  giving her them again  said with
weeping tears  these for my sake  we that are
true lovers run into strange capers  but as all is
mortal in nature  so is all nature in love mortal in folly 


rosalind

thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of 


touchstone

nay  i shall ne be ware of mine own wit till i
break my shins against it 


rosalind

jove  jove  this shepherd passion
is much upon my fashion 


touchstone

and mine  but it grows something stale with me 


celia

i pray you  one of you question yond man
if he for gold will give us any food 
i faint almost to death 


touchstone

holla  you clown 


rosalind

peace  fool  he not thy kinsman 


corin

who calls 


touchstone

your betters  sir 


corin

                  else are they very wretched 


rosalind

peace  i say  good even to you  friend 


corin

and to you  gentle sir  and to you all 


rosalind

i prithee  shepherd  if that love or gold
can in this desert place buy entertainment 
bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed 
here a young maid with travel much oppress 
and faints for succor 


corin

fair sir  i pity her
and wish  for her sake more than for mine own 
my fortunes were more able to relieve her 
but i am shepherd to another man
and do not shear the fleeces that i graze 
my master is of churlish disposition
and little recks to find the way to heaven
by doing deeds of hospitality 
besides  his cote  his flocks and bounds of feed
are now on sale  and at our sheepcote now 
by reason of his absence  there is nothing
that you will feed on  but what is  come see 
and in my voice most welcome shall you be 


rosalind

what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture 


corin

that young swain that you saw here but erewhile 
that little cares for buying any thing 


rosalind

i pray thee  if it stand with honesty 
buy thou the cottage  pasture and the flock 
and thou shalt have to pay for it of us 


celia

and we will mend thy wages  i like this place 
and willingly could waste my time in it 


corin

assuredly the thing is to be sold 
go with me  if you like upon report
the soil  the profit and this kind of life 
i will your very faithful feeder be
and buy it with your gold right suddenly 
exeunt
