scene v  the forest 


enter amiens  jaques  and others


song 


amiens

under the greenwood tree
who loves to lie with me 
and turn his merry note
unto the sweet bird throat 
come hither  come hither  come hither 
here shall he see no enemy
but winter and rough weather 


jaques

more  more  i prithee  more 


amiens

it will make you melancholy  monsieur jaques 


jaques

i thank it  more  i prithee  more  i can suck
melancholy out of a song  as a weasel sucks eggs 
more  i prithee  more 


amiens

my voice is ragged  i know i cannot please you 


jaques

i do not desire you to please me  i do desire you to
sing  come  more  another stanzo  call you  stanzos 


amiens

what you will  monsieur jaques 


jaques

nay  i care not for their names  they owe me
nothing  will you sing 


amiens

more at your request than to please myself 


jaques

well then  if ever i thank any man  i thank you 
but that they call compliment is like the encounter
of two dog apes  and when a man thanks me heartily 
methinks i have given him a penny and he renders me
the beggarly thanks  come  sing  and you that will
not  hold your tongues 


amiens

well  i end the song  sirs  cover the while  the
duke will drink under this tree  he hath been all
this day to look you 


jaques

and i have been all this day to avoid him  he is
too disputable for my company  i think of as many
matters as he  but i give heaven thanks and make no
boast of them  come  warble  come 
song 
who doth ambition shun
all together here
and loves to live i  the sun 
seeking the food he eats
and pleased with what he gets 
come hither  come hither  come hither 
here shall he see no enemy
but winter and rough weather 


jaques

i give you a verse to this note that i made
yesterday in despite of my invention 


amiens

and i sing it 


jaques

thus it goes 
if it do come to pass
that any man turn ass 
leaving his wealth and ease 
a stubborn will to please 
ducdame  ducdame  ducdame 
here shall he see
gross fools as he 
an if he will come to me 


amiens

what that  ducdame 


jaques

 a greek invocation  to call fools into a
circle  i go sleep  if i can  if i cannot  i 
rail against all the first born of egypt 


amiens

and i go seek the duke  his banquet is prepared 
exeunt severally
