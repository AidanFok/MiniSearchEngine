scene vii  the forest 


a table set out  enter duke senior  amiens  and lords like outlaws


duke senior

i think he be transform into a beast 
for i can no where find him like a man 


first lord

my lord  he is but even now gone hence 
here was he merry  hearing of a song 


duke senior

if he  compact of jars  grow musical 
we shall have shortly discord in the spheres 
go  seek him  tell him i would speak with him 
enter jaques


first lord

he saves my labour by his own approach 


duke senior

why  how now  monsieur  what a life is this 
that your poor friends must woo your company 
what  you look merrily 


jaques

a fool  a fool  i met a fool i  the forest 
a motley fool  a miserable world 
as i do live by food  i met a fool
who laid him down and bask him in the sun 
and rail on lady fortune in good terms 
in good set terms and yet a motley fool 
 morrow  fool  quoth i   no  sir  quoth he 
 me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune 
and then he drew a dial from his poke 
and  looking on it with lack lustre eye 
says very wisely   is ten o clock 
thus we may see  quoth he   the world wags 
 but an hour ago since it was nine 
and after one hour more  be eleven 
and so  from hour to hour  we ripe and ripe 
and then  from hour to hour  we rot and rot 
and thereby hangs a tale  when i did hear
the motley fool thus moral on the time 
my lungs began to crow like chanticleer 
that fools should be so deep contemplative 
and i did laugh sans intermission
an hour by his dial  o noble fool 
a worthy fool  motley the only wear 


duke senior

what fool is this 


jaques

o worthy fool  one that hath been a courtier 
and says  if ladies be but young and fair 
they have the gift to know it  and in his brain 
which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
after a voyage  he hath strange places cramm 
with observation  the which he vents
in mangled forms  o that i were a fool 
i am ambitious for a motley coat 


duke senior

thou shalt have one 


jaques

it is my only suit 
provided that you weed your better judgments
of all opinion that grows rank in them
that i am wise  i must have liberty
withal  as large a charter as the wind 
to blow on whom i please  for so fools have 
and they that are most galled with my folly 
they most must laugh  and why  sir  must they so 
the  why  is plain as way to parish church 
he that a fool doth very wisely hit
doth very foolishly  although he smart 
not to seem senseless of the bob  if not 
the wise man folly is anatomized
even by the squandering glances of the fool 
invest me in my motley  give me leave
to speak my mind  and i will through and through
cleanse the foul body of the infected world 
if they will patiently receive my medicine 


duke senior

fie on thee  i can tell what thou wouldst do 


jaques

what  for a counter  would i do but good 


duke senior

most mischievous foul sin  in chiding sin 
for thou thyself hast been a libertine 
as sensual as the brutish sting itself 
and all the embossed sores and headed evils 
that thou with licence of free foot hast caught 
wouldst thou disgorge into the general world 


jaques

why  who cries out on pride 
that can therein tax any private party 
doth it not flow as hugely as the sea 
till that the weary very means do ebb 
what woman in the city do i name 
when that i say the city woman bears
the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders 
who can come in and say that i mean her 
when such a one as she such is her neighbour 
or what is he of basest function
that says his bravery is not of my cost 
thinking that i mean him  but therein suits
his folly to the mettle of my speech 
there then  how then  what then  let me see wherein
my tongue hath wrong him  if it do him right 
then he hath wrong himself  if he be free 
why then my taxing like a wild goose flies 
unclaim of any man  but who comes here 
enter orlando  with his sword drawn


orlando

forbear  and eat no more 


jaques

why  i have eat none yet 


orlando

nor shalt not  till necessity be served 


jaques

of what kind should this cock come of 


duke senior

art thou thus bolden d  man  by thy distress 
or else a rude despiser of good manners 
that in civility thou seem so empty 


orlando

you touch my vein at first  the thorny point
of bare distress hath ta from me the show
of smooth civility  yet am i inland bred
and know some nurture  but forbear  i say 
he dies that touches any of this fruit
till i and my affairs are answered 


jaques

an you will not be answered with reason  i must die 


duke senior

what would you have  your gentleness shall force
more than your force move us to gentleness 


orlando

i almost die for food  and let me have it 


duke senior

sit down and feed  and welcome to our table 


orlando

speak you so gently  pardon me  i pray you 
i thought that all things had been savage here 
and therefore put i on the countenance
of stern commandment  but whate you are
that in this desert inaccessible 
under the shade of melancholy boughs 
lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
if ever you have look on better days 
if ever been where bells have knoll to church 
if ever sat at any good man feast 
if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
and know what  to pity and be pitied 
let gentleness my strong enforcement be 
in the which hope i blush  and hide my sword 


duke senior

true is it that we have seen better days 
and have with holy bell been knoll to church
and sat at good men feasts and wiped our eyes
of drops that sacred pity hath engender d 
and therefore sit you down in gentleness
and take upon command what help we have
that to your wanting may be minister d 


orlando

then but forbear your food a little while 
whiles  like a doe  i go to find my fawn
and give it food  there is an old poor man 
who after me hath many a weary step
limp in pure love  till he be first sufficed 
oppress with two weak evils  age and hunger 
i will not touch a bit 


duke senior

go find him out 
and we will nothing waste till you return 


orlando

i thank ye  and be blest for your good comfort 
exit


duke senior

thou seest we are not all alone unhappy 
this wide and universal theatre
presents more woeful pageants than the scene
wherein we play in 


jaques

all the world a stage 
and all the men and women merely players 
they have their exits and their entrances 
and one man in his time plays many parts 
his acts being seven ages  at first the infant 
mewling and puking in the nurse arms 
and then the whining school boy  with his satchel
and shining morning face  creeping like snail
unwillingly to school  and then the lover 
sighing like furnace  with a woeful ballad
made to his mistress  eyebrow  then a soldier 
full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard 
jealous in honour  sudden and quick in quarrel 
seeking the bubble reputation
even in the cannon mouth  and then the justice 
in fair round belly with good capon lined 
with eyes severe and beard of formal cut 
full of wise saws and modern instances 
and so he plays his part  the sixth age shifts
into the lean and slipper pantaloon 
with spectacles on nose and pouch on side 
his youthful hose  well saved  a world too wide
for his shrunk shank  and his big manly voice 
turning again toward childish treble  pipes
and whistles in his sound  last scene of all 
that ends this strange eventful history 
is second childishness and mere oblivion 
sans teeth  sans eyes  sans taste  sans everything 
re enter orlando  with adam


duke senior

welcome  set down your venerable burthen 
and let him feed 


orlando

i thank you most for him 


adam

so had you need 
i scarce can speak to thank you for myself 


duke senior

welcome  fall to  i will not trouble you
as yet  to question you about your fortunes 
give us some music  and  good cousin  sing 
song 


amiens

blow  blow  thou winter wind 
thou art not so unkind
as man ingratitude 
thy tooth is not so keen 
because thou art not seen 
although thy breath be rude 
heigh ho  sing  heigh ho  unto the green holly 
most friendship is feigning  most loving mere folly 
then  heigh ho  the holly 
this life is most jolly 
freeze  freeze  thou bitter sky 
that dost not bite so nigh
as benefits forgot 
though thou the waters warp 
thy sting is not so sharp
as friend remember not 
heigh ho  sing     c 


duke senior

if that you were the good sir rowland son 
as you have whisper faithfully you were 
and as mine eye doth his effigies witness
most truly limn and living in your face 
be truly welcome hither  i am the duke
that loved your father  the residue of your fortune 
go to my cave and tell me  good old man 
thou art right welcome as thy master is 
support him by the arm  give me your hand 
and let me all your fortunes understand
