hang there  my verse  in witness of my love 
and thou  thrice crowned queen of night  survey
with thy chaste eye  from thy pale sphere above 
thy huntress  name that my full life doth sway 
o rosalind  these trees shall be my books
and in their barks my thoughts i character 
that every eye which in this forest looks
shall see thy virtue witness every where 
run  run  orlando  carve on every tree
the fair  the chaste and unexpressive she

corin

and how like you this shepherd life  master touchstone 


touchstone

truly  shepherd  in respect of itself  it is a good
life  but in respect that it is a shepherd life 
it is naught  in respect that it is solitary  i
like it very well  but in respect that it is
private  it is a very vile life  now  in respect it
is in the fields  it pleaseth me well  but in
respect it is not in the court  it is tedious  as
is it a spare life  look you  it fits my humour well 
but as there is no more plenty in it  it goes much
against my stomach  hast any philosophy in thee  shepherd 


corin

no more but that i know the more one sickens the
worse at ease he is  and that he that wants money 
means and content is without three good friends 
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
burn  that good pasture makes fat sheep  and that a
great cause of the night is lack of the sun  that
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred 


touchstone

such a one is a natural philosopher  wast ever in
court  shepherd 


corin

no  truly 


touchstone

then thou art damned 


corin

nay  i hope 


touchstone

truly  thou art damned like an ill roasted egg  all
on one side 


corin

for not being at court  your reason 


touchstone

why  if thou never wast at court  thou never sawest
good manners  if thou never sawest good manners 
then thy manners must be wicked  and wickedness is
sin  and sin is damnation  thou art in a parlous
state  shepherd 


corin

not a whit  touchstone  those that are good manners
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
behavior of the country is most mockable at the
court  you told me you salute not at the court  but
you kiss your hands  that courtesy would be
uncleanly  if courtiers were shepherds 


touchstone

instance  briefly  come  instance 


corin

why  we are still handling our ewes  and their
fells  you know  are greasy 


touchstone

why  do not your courtier hands sweat  and is not
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
a man  shallow  shallow  a better instance  i say  come 


corin

besides  our hands are hard 


touchstone

your lips will feel them the sooner  shallow again 
a more sounder instance  come 


corin

and they are often tarred over with the surgery of
our sheep  and would you have us kiss tar  the
courtier hands are perfumed with civet 


touchstone

most shallow man  thou worms meat  in respect of a
good piece of flesh indeed  learn of the wise  and
perpend  civet is of a baser birth than tar  the
very uncleanly flux of a cat  mend the instance  shepherd 


corin

you have too courtly a wit for me  i rest 


touchstone

wilt thou rest damned  god help thee  shallow man 
god make incision in thee  thou art raw 


corin

sir  i am a true labourer  i earn that i eat  get
that i wear  owe no man hate  envy no man 
happiness  glad of other men good  content with my
harm  and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
graze and my lambs suck 


touchstone

that is another simple sin in you  to bring the ewes
and the rams together and to offer to get your
living by the copulation of cattle  to be bawd to a
bell wether  and to betray a she lamb of a
twelvemonth to a crooked pated  old  cuckoldly ram 
out of all reasonable match  if thou beest not
damned for this  the devil himself will have no
shepherds  i cannot see else how thou shouldst
 scape 


corin

here comes young master ganymede  my new mistress brother 
enter rosalind  with a paper  reading


rosalind

     from the east to western ind 
no jewel is like rosalind 
her worth  being mounted on the wind 
through all the world bears rosalind 
all the pictures fairest lined
are but black to rosalind 
let no fair be kept in mind
but the fair of rosalind 


touchstone

i rhyme you so eight years together  dinners and
suppers and sleeping hours excepted  it is the
right butter women rank to market 


rosalind

out  fool 


touchstone

for a taste 
if a hart do lack a hind 
let him seek out rosalind 
if the cat will after kind 
so be sure will rosalind 
winter garments must be lined 
so must slender rosalind 
they that reap must sheaf and bind 
then to cart with rosalind 
sweetest nut hath sourest rind 
such a nut is rosalind 
he that sweetest rose will find
must find love prick and rosalind 
this is the very false gallop of verses  why do you
infect yourself with them 


rosalind

peace  you dull fool  i found them on a tree 


touchstone

truly  the tree yields bad fruit 


rosalind

i graff it with you  and then i shall graff it
with a medlar  then it will be the earliest fruit
i  the country  for you be rotten ere you be half
ripe  and that the right virtue of the medlar 


touchstone

you have said  but whether wisely or no  let the
forest judge 
enter celia  with a writing


rosalind

peace  here comes my sister  reading  stand aside 


celia

 reads 
why should this a desert be 
for it is unpeopled  no 
tongues i hang on every tree 
that shall civil sayings show 
some  how brief the life of man
runs his erring pilgrimage 
that the stretching of a span
buckles in his sum of age 
some  of violated vows
 the souls of friend and friend 
but upon the fairest boughs 
or at every sentence end 
will i rosalinda write 
teaching all that read to know
the quintessence of every sprite
heaven would in little show 
therefore heaven nature charged
that one body should be fill 
with all graces wide enlarged 
nature presently distill 
helen cheek  but not her heart 
cleopatra majesty 
atalanta better part 
sad lucretia modesty 
thus rosalind of many parts
by heavenly synod was devised 
of many faces  eyes and hearts 
to have the touches dearest prized 
heaven would that she these gifts should have 
and i to live and die her slave 


rosalind

o most gentle pulpiter  what tedious homily of love
have you wearied your parishioners withal  and never
cried  patience  good people 


celia

how now  back  friends  shepherd  go off a little 
go with him  sirrah 


touchstone

come  shepherd  let us make an honourable retreat 
though not with bag and baggage  yet with scrip and scrippage 
exeunt corin and touchstone


celia

didst thou hear these verses 


rosalind

o  yes  i heard them all  and more too  for some of
them had in them more feet than the verses would bear 


celia

that no matter  the feet might bear the verses 


rosalind

ay  but the feet were lame and could not bear
themselves without the verse and therefore stood
lamely in the verse 


celia

but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
should be hanged and carved upon these trees 


rosalind

i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
before you came  for look here what i found on a
palm tree  i was never so be rhymed since
pythagoras  time  that i was an irish rat  which i
can hardly remember 


celia

trow you who hath done this 


rosalind

is it a man 


celia

and a chain  that you once wore  about his neck 
change you colour 


rosalind

i prithee  who 


celia

o lord  lord  it is a hard matter for friends to
meet  but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
and so encounter 


rosalind

nay  but who is it 


celia

is it possible 


rosalind

nay  i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence 
tell me who it is 


celia

o wonderful  wonderful  and most wonderful
wonderful  and yet again wonderful  and after that 
out of all hooping 


rosalind

good my complexion  dost thou think  though i am
caparisoned like a man  i have a doublet and hose in
my disposition  one inch of delay more is a
south sea of discovery  i prithee  tell me who is it
quickly  and speak apace  i would thou couldst
stammer  that thou mightst pour this concealed man
out of thy mouth  as wine comes out of a narrow 
mouthed bottle  either too much at once  or none at
all  i prithee  take the cork out of thy mouth that
may drink thy tidings 


celia

so you may put a man in your belly 


rosalind

is he of god making  what manner of man  is his
head worth a hat  or his chin worth a beard 


celia

nay  he hath but a little beard 


rosalind

why  god will send more  if the man will be
thankful  let me stay the growth of his beard  if
thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin 


celia

it is young orlando  that tripped up the wrestler 
heels and your heart both in an instant 


rosalind

nay  but the devil take mocking  speak  sad brow and
true maid 


celia

i  faith  coz   he 


rosalind

orlando 


celia

orlando 


rosalind

alas the day  what shall i do with my doublet and
hose  what did he when thou sawest him  what said
he  how looked he  wherein went he  what makes
him here  did he ask for me  where remains he 
how parted he with thee  and when shalt thou see
him again  answer me in one word 


celia

you must borrow me gargantua mouth first   a
word too great for any mouth of this age size  to
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
answer in a catechism 


rosalind

but doth he know that i am in this forest and in
man apparel  looks he as freshly as he did the
day he wrestled 


celia

it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
propositions of a lover  but take a taste of my
finding him  and relish it with good observance 
i found him under a tree  like a dropped acorn 


rosalind

it may well be called jove tree  when it drops
forth such fruit 


celia

give me audience  good madam 


rosalind

proceed 


celia

there lay he  stretched along  like a wounded knight 


rosalind

though it be pity to see such a sight  it well
becomes the ground 


celia

cry  holla  to thy tongue  i prithee  it curvets
unseasonably  he was furnished like a hunter 


rosalind

o  ominous  he comes to kill my heart 


celia

i would sing my song without a burden  thou bringest
me out of tune 


rosalind

do you not know i am a woman  when i think  i must
speak  sweet  say on 


celia

you bring me out  soft  comes he not here 
enter orlando and jaques


rosalind

 he  slink by  and note him 


jaques

i thank you for your company  but  good faith  i had
as lief have been myself alone 


orlando

and so had i  but yet  for fashion sake  i thank you
too for your society 


jaques

god be wi  you  let meet as little as we can 


orlando

i do desire we may be better strangers 


jaques

i pray you  mar no more trees with writing
love songs in their barks 


orlando

i pray you  mar no more of my verses with reading
them ill favouredly 


jaques

rosalind is your love name 


orlando

yes  just 


jaques

i do not like her name 


orlando

there was no thought of pleasing you when she was
christened 


jaques

what stature is she of 


orlando

just as high as my heart 


jaques

you are full of pretty answers  have you not been
acquainted with goldsmiths  wives  and conned them
out of rings 


orlando

not so  but i answer you right painted cloth  from
whence you have studied your questions 


jaques

you have a nimble wit  i think  made of
atalanta heels  will you sit down with me  and
we two will rail against our mistress the world and
all our misery 


orlando

i will chide no breather in the world but myself 
against whom i know most faults 


jaques

the worst fault you have is to be in love 


orlando

 a fault i will not change for your best virtue 
i am weary of you 


jaques

by my troth  i was seeking for a fool when i found
you 


orlando

he is drowned in the brook  look but in  and you
shall see him 


jaques

there i shall see mine own figure 


orlando

which i take to be either a fool or a cipher 


jaques

i tarry no longer with you  farewell  good
signior love 


orlando

i am glad of your departure  adieu  good monsieur
melancholy 
exit jaques


rosalind

 aside to celia   i will speak to him  like a saucy
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him 
do you hear  forester 


orlando

very well  what would you 


rosalind

i pray you  what is o clock 


orlando

you should ask me what time o  day  there no clock
in the forest 


rosalind

then there is no true lover in the forest  else
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock 


orlando

and why not the swift foot of time  had not that
been as proper 


rosalind

by no means  sir  time travels in divers paces with
divers persons  i tell you who time ambles
withal  who time trots withal  who time gallops
withal and who he stands still withal 


orlando

i prithee  who doth he trot withal 


rosalind

marry  he trots hard with a young maid between the
contract of her marriage and the day it is
solemnized  if the interim be but a se nnight 
time pace is so hard that it seems the length of
seven year 


orlando

who ambles time withal 


rosalind

with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that
hath not the gout  for the one sleeps easily because
he cannot study  and the other lives merrily because
he feels no pain  the one lacking the burden of lean
and wasteful learning  the other knowing no burden
of heavy tedious penury  these time ambles withal 


orlando

who doth he gallop withal 


rosalind

with a thief to the gallows  for though he go as
softly as foot can fall  he thinks himself too soon there 


orlando

who stays it still withal 


rosalind

with lawyers in the vacation  for they sleep between
term and term and then they perceive not how time moves 


orlando

where dwell you  pretty youth 


rosalind

with this shepherdess  my sister  here in the
skirts of the forest  like fringe upon a petticoat 


orlando

are you native of this place 


rosalind

as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled 


orlando

your accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling 


rosalind

i have been told so of many  but indeed an old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak  who was
in his youth an inland man  one that knew courtship
too well  for there he fell in love  i have heard
him read many lectures against it  and i thank god
i am not a woman  to be touched with so many
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
whole sex withal 


orlando

can you remember any of the principal evils that he
laid to the charge of women 


rosalind

there were none principal  they were all like one
another as half pence are  every one fault seeming
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it 


orlando

i prithee  recount some of them 


rosalind

no  i will not cast away my physic but on those that
are sick  there is a man haunts the forest  that
abuses our young plants with carving  rosalind  on
their barks  hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
on brambles  all  forsooth  deifying the name of
rosalind  if i could meet that fancy monger i would
give him some good counsel  for he seems to have the
quotidian of love upon him 


orlando

i am he that is so love shaked  i pray you tell me
your remedy 


rosalind

there is none of my uncle marks upon you  he
taught me how to know a man in love  in which cage
of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner 


orlando

what were his marks 


rosalind

a lean cheek  which you have not  a blue eye and
sunken  which you have not  an unquestionable
spirit  which you have not  a beard neglected 
which you have not  but i pardon you for that  for
simply your having in beard is a younger brother 
revenue  then your hose should be ungartered  your
bonnet unbanded  your sleeve unbuttoned  your shoe
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
careless desolation  but you are no such man  you
are rather point device in your accoutrements as
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other 


orlando

fair youth  i would i could make thee believe i love 


rosalind

me believe it  you may as soon make her that you
love believe it  which  i warrant  she is apter to
do than to confess she does  that is one of the
points in the which women still give the lie to
their consciences  but  in good sooth  are you he
that hangs the verses on the trees  wherein rosalind
is so admired 


orlando

i swear to thee  youth  by the white hand of
rosalind  i am that he  that unfortunate he 


rosalind

but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak 


orlando

neither rhyme nor reason can express how much 


rosalind

love is merely a madness  and  i tell you  deserves
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do  and
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
is  that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
are in love too  yet i profess curing it by counsel 


orlando

did you ever cure any so 


rosalind

yes  one  and in this manner  he was to imagine me
his love  his mistress  and i set him every day to
woo me  at which time would i  being but a moonish
youth  grieve  be effeminate  changeable  longing
and liking  proud  fantastical  apish  shallow 
inconstant  full of tears  full of smiles  for every
passion something and for no passion truly any
thing  as boys and women are for the most part
cattle of this colour  would now like him  now loathe
him  then entertain him  then forswear him  now weep
for him  then spit at him  that i drave my suitor
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
madness  which was  to forswear the full stream of
the world  and to live in a nook merely monastic 
and thus i cured him  and this way will i take upon
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep 
heart  that there shall not be one spot of love in t 


orlando

i would not be cured  youth 


rosalind

i would cure you  if you would but call me rosalind
and come every day to my cote and woo me 


orlando

now  by the faith of my love  i will  tell me
where it is 


rosalind

go with me to it and i show it you and by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live 
will you go 


orlando

with all my heart  good youth 


rosalind

nay you must call me rosalind  come  sister  will you go
