scene iii  the forest 


enter touchstone and audrey  jaques behind


touchstone

come apace  good audrey  i will fetch up your
goats  audrey  and how  audrey  am i the man yet 
doth my simple feature content you 


audrey

your features  lord warrant us  what features 


touchstone

i am here with thee and thy goats  as the most
capricious poet  honest ovid  was among the goths 


jaques

 aside   o knowledge ill inhabited  worse than jove
in a thatched house 


touchstone

when a man verses cannot be understood  nor a
man good wit seconded with the forward child
understanding  it strikes a man more dead than a
great reckoning in a little room  truly  i would
the gods had made thee poetical 


audrey

i do not know what  poetical  is  is it honest in
deed and word  is it a true thing 


touchstone

no  truly  for the truest poetry is the most
feigning  and lovers are given to poetry  and what
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign 


audrey

do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical 


touchstone

i do  truly  for thou swearest to me thou art
honest  now  if thou wert a poet  i might have some
hope thou didst feign 


audrey

would you not have me honest 


touchstone

no  truly  unless thou wert hard favoured  for
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar 


jaques

 aside   a material fool 


audrey

 well  i am not fair  and therefore i pray the gods
make me honest 


touchstone

truly  and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
were to put good meat into an unclean dish 


audrey

i am not a slut  though i thank the gods i am foul 


touchstone

well  praised be the gods for thy foulness 
sluttishness may come hereafter  but be it as it may
be  i will marry thee  and to that end i have been
with sir oliver martext  the vicar of the next
village  who hath promised to meet me in this place
of the forest and to couple us 


jaques

 aside   i would fain see this meeting 


audrey

well  the gods give us joy 


touchstone

amen  a man may  if he were of a fearful heart 
stagger in this attempt  for here we have no temple
but the wood  no assembly but horn beasts  but what
though  c ourage  as horns are odious  they are
necessary  it is said   a man knows no end of
his goods  right  many a man has good horns  and
knows no end of them  well  that is the dowry of
his wife   none of his own getting  horns 
even so  poor men alone  no  no  the noblest deer
hath them as huge as the rascal  is the single man
therefore blessed  no  as a walled town is more
worthier than a village  so is the forehead of a
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
bachelor  and by how much defence is better than no
skill  by so much is a horn more precious than to
want  here comes sir oliver 
enter sir oliver martext
sir oliver martext  you are well met  will you
dispatch us here under this tree  or shall we go
with you to your chapel 


sir oliver martext

is there none here to give the woman 


touchstone

i will not take her on gift of any man 


sir oliver martext

truly  she must be given  or the marriage is not lawful 


jaques

 advancing 
proceed  proceed	i give her 


touchstone

good even  good master what ye call t  how do you 
sir  you are very well met  god  you for your
last company  i am very glad to see you  even a
toy in hand here  sir  nay  pray be covered 


jaques

will you be married  motley 


touchstone

as the ox hath his bow  sir  the horse his curb and
the falcon her bells  so man hath his desires  and
as pigeons bill  so wedlock would be nibbling 


jaques

and will you  being a man of your breeding  be
married under a bush like a beggar  get you to
church  and have a good priest that can tell you
what marriage is  this fellow will but join you
together as they join wainscot  then one of you will
prove a shrunk panel and  like green timber  warp  warp 


touchstone

 aside   i am not in the mind but i were better to be
married of him than of another  for he is not like
to marry me well  and not being well married  it
will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife 


jaques

go thou with me  and let me counsel thee 


touchstone

 come  sweet audrey 
we must be married  or we must live in bawdry 
farewell  good master oliver  not 
o sweet oliver 
o brave oliver 
leave me not behind thee  but 
wind away 
begone  i say 
i will not to wedding with thee 
exeunt jaques  touchstone and audrey


sir oliver martext

 no matter  ne a fantastical knave of them
all shall flout me out of my calling 
exit
