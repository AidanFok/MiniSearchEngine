scene iv  the forest 


enter rosalind and celia


rosalind

never talk to me  i will weep 


celia

do  i prithee  but yet have the grace to consider
that tears do not become a man 


rosalind

but have i not cause to weep 


celia

as good cause as one would desire  therefore weep 


rosalind

his very hair is of the dissembling colour 


celia

something browner than judas marry  his kisses are
judas own children 


rosalind

i  faith  his hair is of a good colour 


celia

an excellent colour  your chestnut was ever the only colour 


rosalind

and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
of holy bread 


celia

he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana  a nun
of winter sisterhood kisses not more religiously 
the very ice of chastity is in them 


rosalind

but why did he swear he would come this morning  and
comes not 


celia

nay  certainly  there is no truth in him 


rosalind

do you think so 


celia

yes  i think he is not a pick purse nor a
horse stealer  but for his verity in love  i do
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
worm eaten nut 


rosalind

not true in love 


celia

yes  when he is in  but i think he is not in 


rosalind

you have heard him swear downright he was 


celia

 was  is not  is  besides  the oath of a lover is
no stronger than the word of a tapster  they are
both the confirmer of false reckonings  he attends
here in the forest on the duke your father 


rosalind

i met the duke yesterday and had much question with
him  he asked me of what parentage i was  i told
him  of as good as he  so he laughed and let me go 
but what talk we of fathers  when there is such a
man as orlando 


celia

o  that a brave man  he writes brave verses 
speaks brave words  swears brave oaths and breaks
them bravely  quite traverse  athwart the heart of
his lover  as a puisny tilter  that spurs his horse
but on one side  breaks his staff like a noble
goose  but all brave that youth mounts and folly
guides  who comes here 
enter corin


corin

mistress and master  you have oft inquired
after the shepherd that complain of love 
who you saw sitting by me on the turf 
praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
that was his mistress 


celia

well  and what of him 


corin

if you will see a pageant truly play d 
between the pale complexion of true love
and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain 
go hence a little and i shall conduct you 
if you will mark it 


rosalind

o  come  let us remove 
the sight of lovers feedeth those in love 
bring us to this sight  and you shall say
i prove a busy actor in their play 
exeunt
