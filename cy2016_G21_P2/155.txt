scene i  the forest 


enter rosalind  celia  and jaques


jaques

i prithee  pretty youth  let me be better acquainted
with thee 


rosalind

they say you are a melancholy fellow 


jaques

i am so  i do love it better than laughing 


rosalind

those that are in extremity of either are abominable
fellows and betray themselves to every modern
censure worse than drunkards 


jaques

why   good to be sad and say nothing 


rosalind

why then   good to be a post 


jaques

i have neither the scholar melancholy  which is
emulation  nor the musician s  which is fantastical 
nor the courtier s  which is proud  nor the
soldier s  which is ambitious  nor the lawyer s 
which is politic  nor the lady s  which is nice  nor
the lover s  which is all these  but it is a
melancholy of mine own  compounded of many simples 
extracted from many objects  and indeed the sundry 
contemplation of my travels  in which my often
rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness 


rosalind

a traveller  by my faith  you have great reason to
be sad  i fear you have sold your own lands to see
other men s  then  to have seen much and to have
nothing  is to have rich eyes and poor hands 


jaques

yes  i have gained my experience 


rosalind

and your experience makes you sad  i had rather have
a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
sad  and to travel for it too 
enter orlando


orlando

good day and happiness  dear rosalind 


jaques

nay  then  god be wi  you  an you talk in blank verse 
exit


rosalind

farewell  monsieur traveller  look you lisp and
wear strange suits  disable all the benefits of your
own country  be out of love with your nativity and
almost chide god for making you that countenance you
are  or i will scarce think you have swam in a
gondola  why  how now  orlando  where have you been
all this while  you a lover  an you serve me such
another trick  never come in my sight more 


orlando

my fair rosalind  i come within an hour of my promise 


rosalind

break an hour promise in love  he that will
divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
affairs of love  it may be said of him that cupid
hath clapped him o  the shoulder  but i warrant
him heart whole 


orlando

pardon me  dear rosalind 


rosalind

nay  an you be so tardy  come no more in my sight  i
had as lief be wooed of a snail 


orlando

of a snail 


rosalind

ay  of a snail  for though he comes slowly  he
carries his house on his head  a better jointure 
i think  than you make a woman  besides he brings
his destiny with him 


orlando

what that 


rosalind

why  horns  which such as you are fain to be
beholding to your wives for  but he comes armed in
his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife 


orlando

virtue is no horn maker  and my rosalind is virtuous 


rosalind

and i am your rosalind 


celia

it pleases him to call you so  but he hath a
rosalind of a better leer than you 


rosalind

come  woo me  woo me  for now i am in a holiday
humour and like enough to consent  what would you
say to me now  an i were your very very rosalind 


orlando

i would kiss before i spoke 


rosalind

nay  you were better speak first  and when you were
gravelled for lack of matter  you might take
occasion to kiss  very good orators  when they are
out  they will spit  and for lovers lacking god
warn us matter  the cleanliest shift is to kiss 


orlando

how if the kiss be denied 


rosalind

then she puts you to entreaty  and there begins new matter 


orlando

who could be out  being before his beloved mistress 


rosalind

marry  that should you  if i were your mistress  or
i should think my honesty ranker than my wit 


orlando

what  of my suit 


rosalind

not out of your apparel  and yet out of your suit 
am not i your rosalind 


orlando

i take some joy to say you are  because i would be
talking of her 


rosalind

well in her person i say i will not have you 


orlando

then in mine own person i die 


rosalind

no  faith  die by attorney  the poor world is
almost six thousand years old  and in all this time
there was not any man died in his own person 
videlicit  in a love cause  troilus had his brains
dashed out with a grecian club  yet he did what he
could to die before  and he is one of the patterns
of love  leander  he would have lived many a fair
year  though hero had turned nun  if it had not been
for a hot midsummer night  for  good youth  he went
but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being
taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
coroners of that age found it was  of sestos 
but these are all lies  men have died from time to
time and worms have eaten them  but not for love 


orlando

i would not have my right rosalind of this mind 
for  i protest  her frown might kill me 


rosalind

by this hand  it will not kill a fly  but come  now
i will be your rosalind in a more coming on
disposition  and ask me what you will  i will grant
it 


orlando

then love me  rosalind 


rosalind

yes  faith  will i  fridays and saturdays and all 


orlando

and wilt thou have me 


rosalind

ay  and twenty such 


orlando

what sayest thou 


rosalind

are you not good 


orlando

i hope so 


rosalind

why then  can one desire too much of a good thing 
come  sister  you shall be the priest and marry us 
give me your hand  orlando  what do you say  sister 


orlando

pray thee  marry us 


celia

i cannot say the words 


rosalind

you must begin   you  orlando 


celia

go to  will you  orlando  have to wife this rosalind 


orlando

i will 


rosalind

ay  but when 


orlando

why now  as fast as she can marry us 


rosalind

then you must say  take thee  rosalind  for wife 


orlando

i take thee  rosalind  for wife 


rosalind

i might ask you for your commission  but i do take
thee  orlando  for my husband  there a girl goes
before the priest  and certainly a woman thought
runs before her actions 


orlando

so do all thoughts  they are winged 


rosalind

now tell me how long you would have her after you
have possessed her 


orlando

for ever and a day 


rosalind

say  day  without the  ever  no  no  orlando 
men are april when they woo  december when they wed 
maids are may when they are maids  but the sky
changes when they are wives  i will be more jealous
of thee than a barbary cock pigeon over his hen 
more clamorous than a parrot against rain  more
new fangled than an ape  more giddy in my desires
than a monkey  i will weep for nothing  like diana
in the fountain  and i will do that when you are
disposed to be merry  i will laugh like a hyen  and
that when thou art inclined to sleep 


orlando

but will my rosalind do so 


rosalind

by my life  she will do as i do 


orlando

o  but she is wise 


rosalind

or else she could not have the wit to do this  the
wiser  the waywarder  make the doors upon a woman 
wit and it will out at the casement  shut that and
 out at the key hole  stop that   fly
with the smoke out at the chimney 


orlando

a man that had a wife with such a wit  he might say
 wit  whither wilt 


rosalind

nay  you might keep that cheque for it till you met
your wife wit going to your neighbour bed 


orlando

and what wit could wit have to excuse that 


rosalind

marry  to say she came to seek you there  you shall
never take her without her answer  unless you take
her without her tongue  o  that woman that cannot
make her fault her husband occasion  let her
never nurse her child herself  for she will breed
it like a fool 


orlando

for these two hours  rosalind  i will leave thee 


rosalind

alas  dear love  i cannot lack thee two hours 


orlando

i must attend the duke at dinner  by two o i
will be with thee again 


rosalind

ay  go your ways  go your ways  i knew what you
would prove  my friends told me as much  and i
thought no less  that flattering tongue of yours
won me   but one cast away  and so  come 
death  two o is your hour 


orlando

ay  sweet rosalind 


rosalind

by my troth  and in good earnest  and so god mend
me  and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous 
if you break one jot of your promise or come one
minute behind your hour  i will think you the most
pathetical break promise and the most hollow lover
and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that
may be chosen out of the gross band of the
unfaithful  therefore beware my censure and keep
your promise 


orlando

with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
rosalind  so adieu 


rosalind

well  time is the old justice that examines all such
offenders  and let time try  adieu 
exit orlando


celia

you have simply misused our sex in your love prate 
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
head  and show the world what the bird hath done to
her own nest 


rosalind

o coz  coz  coz  my pretty little coz  that thou
didst know how many fathom deep i am in love  but
it cannot be sounded  my affection hath an unknown
bottom  like the bay of portugal 


celia

or rather  bottomless  that as fast as you pour
affection in  it runs out 


rosalind

no  that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot
of thought  conceived of spleen and born of madness 
that blind rascally boy that abuses every one eyes
because his own are out  let him be judge how deep i
am in love  i tell thee  aliena  i cannot be out
of the sight of orlando  i go find a shadow and
sigh till he come 


celia

and i sleep 
exeunt
