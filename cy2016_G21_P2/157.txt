scene iii  the forest 


enter rosalind and celia


rosalind

how say you now  is it not past two o clock  and
here much orlando 


celia

i warrant you  with pure love and troubled brain  he
hath ta his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
sleep  look  who comes here 
enter silvius


silvius

my errand is to you  fair youth 
my gentle phebe bid me give you this 
i know not the contents  but  as i guess
by the stern brow and waspish action
which she did use as she was writing of it 
it bears an angry tenor  pardon me 
i am but as a guiltless messenger 


rosalind

patience herself would startle at this letter
and play the swaggerer  bear this  bear all 
she says i am not fair  that i lack manners 
she calls me proud  and that she could not love me 
were man as rare as phoenix   od my will 
her love is not the hare that i do hunt 
why writes she so to me  well  shepherd  well 
this is a letter of your own device 


silvius

no  i protest  i know not the contents 
phebe did write it 


rosalind

come  come  you are a fool
and turn into the extremity of love 
i saw her hand  she has a leathern hand 
a freestone colour hand  i verily did think
that her old gloves were on  but  her hands 
she has a huswife hand  but that no matter 
i say she never did invent this letter 
this is a man invention and his hand 


silvius

sure  it is hers 


rosalind

why   a boisterous and a cruel style 
a style for challengers  why  she defies me 
like turk to christian  women gentle brain
could not drop forth such giant rude invention
such ethiope words  blacker in their effect
than in their countenance  will you hear the letter 


silvius

so please you  for i never heard it yet 
yet heard too much of phebe cruelty 


rosalind

she phebes me  mark how the tyrant writes 
reads
art thou god to shepherd turn d 
that a maiden heart hath burn d 
can a woman rail thus 


silvius

call you this railing 


rosalind

 reads 
why  thy godhead laid apart 
warr thou with a woman heart 
did you ever hear such railing 
whiles the eye of man did woo me 
that could do no vengeance to me 
meaning me a beast 
if the scorn of your bright eyne
have power to raise such love in mine 
alack  in me what strange effect
would they work in mild aspect 
whiles you chid me  i did love 
how then might your prayers move 
he that brings this love to thee
little knows this love in me 
and by him seal up thy mind 
whether that thy youth and kind
will the faithful offer take
of me and all that i can make 
or else by him my love deny 
and then i study how to die 


silvius

call you this chiding 


celia

alas  poor shepherd 


rosalind

do you pity him  no  he deserves no pity  wilt
thou love such a woman  what  to make thee an
instrument and play false strains upon thee  not to
be endured  well  go your way to her  for i see
love hath made thee a tame snake  and say this to
her  that if she love me  i charge her to love
thee  if she will not  i will never have her unless
thou entreat for her  if you be a true lover 
hence  and not a word  for here comes more company 
exit silvius
enter oliver


oliver

good morrow  fair ones  pray you  if you know 
where in the purlieus of this forest stands
a sheep cote fenced about with olive trees 


celia

west of this place  down in the neighbour bottom 
the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
left on your right hand brings you to the place 
but at this hour the house doth keep itself 
there none within 


oliver

if that an eye may profit by a tongue 
then should i know you by description 
such garments and such years   boy is fair 
of female favour  and bestows himself
like a ripe sister  the woman low
and browner than her brother  are not you
the owner of the house i did inquire for 


celia

it is no boast  being ask d  to say we are 


oliver

orlando doth commend him to you both 
and to that youth he calls his rosalind
he sends this bloody napkin  are you he 


rosalind

i am  what must we understand by this 


oliver

some of my shame  if you will know of me
what man i am  and how  and why  and where
this handkercher was stain d 


celia

i pray you  tell it 


oliver

when last the young orlando parted from you
he left a promise to return again
within an hour  and pacing through the forest 
chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy 
lo  what befell  he threw his eye aside 
and mark what object did present itself 
under an oak  whose boughs were moss with age
and high top bald with dry antiquity 
a wretched ragged man  o with hair 
lay sleeping on his back  about his neck
a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself 
who with her head nimble in threats approach 
the opening of his mouth  but suddenly 
seeing orlando  it unlink itself 
and with indented glides did slip away
into a bush  under which bush shade
a lioness  with udders all drawn dry 
lay couching  head on ground  with catlike watch 
when that the sleeping man should stir  for  
the royal disposition of that beast
to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead 
this seen  orlando did approach the man
and found it was his brother  his elder brother 


celia

o  i have heard him speak of that same brother 
and he did render him the most unnatural
that lived amongst men 


oliver

and well he might so do 
for well i know he was unnatural 


rosalind

but  to orlando  did he leave him there 
food to the suck and hungry lioness 


oliver

twice did he turn his back and purposed so 
but kindness  nobler ever than revenge 
and nature  stronger than his just occasion 
made him give battle to the lioness 
who quickly fell before him  in which hurtling
from miserable slumber i awaked 


celia

are you his brother 


rosalind

wast you he rescued 


celia

was you that did so oft contrive to kill him 


oliver

 i  but  not i	i do not shame
to tell you what i was  since my conversion
so sweetly tastes  being the thing i am 


rosalind

but  for the bloody napkin 


oliver

by and by 
when from the first to last betwixt us two
tears our recountments had most kindly bathed 
as how i came into that desert place 
in brief  he led me to the gentle duke 
who gave me fresh array and entertainment 
committing me unto my brother love 
who led me instantly unto his cave 
there stripp himself  and here upon his arm
the lioness had torn some flesh away 
which all this while had bled  and now he fainted
and cried  in fainting  upon rosalind 
brief  i recover him  bound up his wound 
and  after some small space  being strong at heart 
he sent me hither  stranger as i am 
to tell this story  that you might excuse
his broken promise  and to give this napkin
dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
that he in sport doth call his rosalind 
rosalind swoons


celia

why  how now  ganymede  sweet ganymede 


oliver

many will swoon when they do look on blood 


celia

there is more in it  cousin ganymede 


oliver

look  he recovers 


rosalind

i would i were at home 


celia

we lead you thither 
i pray you  will you take him by the arm 


oliver

be of good cheer  youth  you a man  you lack a
man heart 


rosalind

i do so  i confess it  ah  sirrah  a body would
think this was well counterfeited  i pray you  tell
your brother how well i counterfeited  heigh ho 


oliver

this was not counterfeit  there is too great
testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
of earnest 


rosalind

counterfeit  i assure you 


oliver

well then  take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man 


rosalind

so i do  but  i  faith  i should have been a woman by right 


celia

come  you look paler and paler  pray you  draw
homewards  good sir  go with us 


oliver

that will i  for i must bear answer back
how you excuse my brother  rosalind 


rosalind

i shall devise something  but  i pray you  commend
my counterfeiting to him  will you go 
exeunt
