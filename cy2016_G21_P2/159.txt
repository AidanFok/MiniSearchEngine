scene ii  the forest 


enter orlando and oliver


orlando

is possible that on so little acquaintance you
should like her  that but seeing you should love
her  and loving woo  and  wooing  she should
grant  and will you persever to enjoy her 


oliver

neither call the giddiness of it in question  the
poverty of her  the small acquaintance  my sudden
wooing  nor her sudden consenting  but say with me 
i love aliena  say with her that she loves me 
consent with both that we may enjoy each other  it
shall be to your good  for my father house and all
the revenue that was old sir rowland will i
estate upon you  and here live and die a shepherd 


orlando

you have my consent  let your wedding be to morrow 
thither will i invite the duke and all contented
followers  go you and prepare aliena  for look
you  here comes my rosalind 
enter rosalind


rosalind

god save you  brother 


oliver

and you  fair sister 
exit


rosalind

o  my dear orlando  how it grieves me to see thee
wear thy heart in a scarf 


orlando

it is my arm 


rosalind

i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
of a lion 


orlando

wounded it is  but with the eyes of a lady 


rosalind

did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to
swoon when he showed me your handkerchief 


orlando

ay  and greater wonders than that 


rosalind

o  i know where you are  nay   true  there was
never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
and caesar thrasonical brag of  came  saw  and
overcame  for your brother and my sister no sooner
met but they looked  no sooner looked but they
loved  no sooner loved but they sighed  no sooner
sighed but they asked one another the reason  no
sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy 
and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
to marriage which they will climb incontinent  or
else be incontinent before marriage  they are in
the very wrath of love and they will together  clubs
cannot part them 


orlando

they shall be married to morrow  and i will bid the
duke to the nuptial  but  o  how bitter a thing it
is to look into happiness through another man 
eyes  by so much the more shall i to morrow be at
the height of heart heaviness  by how much i shall
think my brother happy in having what he wishes for 


rosalind

why then  to morrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind 


orlando

i can live no longer by thinking 


rosalind

i will weary you then no longer with idle talking 
know of me then  for now i speak to some purpose 
that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit  i
speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
of my knowledge  insomuch i say i know you are 
neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in
some little measure draw a belief from you  to do
yourself good and not to grace me  believe then  if
you please  that i can do strange things  i have 
since i was three year old  conversed with a
magician  most profound in his art and yet not
damnable  if you do love rosalind so near the heart
as your gesture cries it out  when your brother
marries aliena  shall you marry her  i know into
what straits of fortune she is driven  and it is
not impossible to me  if it appear not inconvenient
to you  to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
as she is and without any danger 


orlando

speakest thou in sober meanings 


rosalind

by my life  i do  which i tender dearly  though i
say i am a magician  therefore  put you in your
best array  bid your friends  for if you will be
married to morrow  you shall  and to rosalind  if you will 
enter silvius and phebe
look  here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers 


phebe

youth  you have done me much ungentleness 
to show the letter that i writ to you 


rosalind

i care not if i have  it is my study
to seem despiteful and ungentle to you 
you are there followed by a faithful shepherd 
look upon him  love him  he worships you 


phebe

good shepherd  tell this youth what  to love 


silvius

and so am i for phebe 


phebe

and i for rosalind 


rosalind

and i for ganymede 


orlando

and i for rosalind 


rosalind

and i for no woman 


silvius

it is to be all made of fantasy 
all made of passion and all made of wishes 
all adoration  duty  and observance 
all humbleness  all patience and impatience 
all purity  all trial  all observance 
and so am i for phebe 


phebe

and so am i for ganymede 


orlando

and so am i for rosalind

orlando

to her that is not here  nor doth not hear 


rosalind

of irish wolves against the moon 
to silvius
i will help you  if i can 
to phebe
