our duty this way lies  for god sake come 
exeunt lancaster and westmoreland


prince henry

by god  thou hast deceived me  lancaster 
i did not think thee lord of such a spirit 
before  i loved thee as a brother  john 
but now  i do respect thee as my soul 


king henry iv

i saw him hold lord percy at the point
with lustier maintenance than i did look for
of such an ungrown warrior 


prince henry

o  this boy
lends mettle to us all 
exit
enter douglas


earl of douglas

another king  they grow like hydra heads 
i am the douglas  fatal to all those
that wear those colours on them  what art thou 
that counterfeit the person of a king 


king henry iv

the king himself  who  douglas  grieves at heart
so many of his shadows thou hast met
and not the very king  i have two boys
seek percy and thyself about the field 
but  seeing thou fall on me so luckily 
i will assay thee  so  defend thyself 


earl of douglas

i fear thou art another counterfeit 
and yet  in faith  thou bear thee like a king 
but mine i am sure thou art  whoe thou be 
and thus i win thee 
they fight  king henry being in danger  prince henry enters


prince henry

hold up thy head  vile scot  or thou art like
never to hold it up again  the spirits
of valiant shirley  stafford  blunt  are in my arms 
it is the prince of wales that threatens thee 
who never promiseth but he means to pay 
they fight  douglas flies
cheerly  my lord	how fares your grace 
sir nicholas gawsey hath for succor sent 
and so hath clifton  i to clifton straight 


king henry iv

stay  and breathe awhile 
thou hast redeem thy lost opinion 
and show thou makest some tender of my life 
in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me 


prince henry

o god  they did me too much injury
that ever said i hearken for your death 
if it were so  i might have let alone
the insulting hand of douglas over you 
which would have been as speedy in your end
as all the poisonous potions in the world
and saved the treacherous labour of your son 


king henry iv

make up to clifton  i to sir nicholas gawsey 
exit
enter hotspur


hotspur

if i mistake not  thou art harry monmouth 


prince henry

thou speak as if i would deny my name 


hotspur

my name is harry percy 


prince henry

why  then i see
a very valiant rebel of the name 
i am the prince of wales  and think not  percy 
to share with me in glory any more 
two stars keep not their motion in one sphere 
nor can one england brook a double reign 
of harry percy and the prince of wales 


hotspur

nor shall it  harry  for the hour is come
to end the one of us  and would to god
thy name in arms were now as great as mine 


prince henry

i make it greater ere i part from thee 
and all the budding honours on thy crest
i crop  to make a garland for my head 


hotspur

i can no longer brook thy vanities 
they fight
enter falstaff


falstaff

well said  hal  to it hal  nay  you shall find no
boy play here  i can tell you 
re enter douglas  he fights with falstaff   who falls down as if he were dead  and exit douglas  hotspur is wounded  and falls


hotspur

o  harry  thou hast robb me of my youth 
i better brook the loss of brittle life
than those proud titles thou hast won of me 
they wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh 
but thought the slave of life  and life time fool 
and time  that takes survey of all the world 
must have a stop  o  i could prophesy 
but that the earthy and cold hand of death
lies on my tongue  no  percy  thou art dust
and food for 
dies


prince henry

for worms  brave percy  fare thee well  great heart 
ill weaved ambition  how much art thou shrunk 
when that this body did contain a spirit 
a kingdom for it was too small a bound 
but now two paces of the vilest earth
is room enough  this earth that bears thee dead
bears not alive so stout a gentleman 
if thou wert sensible of courtesy 
i should not make so dear a show of zeal 
but let my favours hide thy mangled face 
and  even in thy behalf  i thank myself
for doing these fair rites of tenderness 
adieu  and take thy praise with thee to heaven 
thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave 
but not remember in thy epitaph 
he spieth falstaff on the ground
what  old acquaintance  could not all this flesh
keep in a little life  poor jack  farewell 
i could have better spared a better man 
o  i should have a heavy miss of thee 
if i were much in love with vanity 
death hath not struck so fat a deer to day 
though many dearer  in this bloody fray 
embowell will i see thee by and by 
till then in blood by noble percy lie 
exit prince henry


falstaff

 rising up   embowelled  if thou embowel me to day 
i give you leave to powder me and eat me too
to morrow   sblood time to counterfeit  or
that hot termagant scot had paid me scot and lot too 
counterfeit  i lie  i am no counterfeit  to die 
is to be a counterfeit  for he is but the
counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man 
but to counterfeit dying  when a man thereby
liveth  is to be no counterfeit  but the true and
perfect image of life indeed  the better part of
valour is discretion  in the which better part i
have saved my life zounds  i am afraid of this
gunpowder percy  though he be dead  how  if he
should counterfeit too and rise  by my faith  i am
afraid he would prove the better counterfeit 
therefore i make him sure  yea  and i swear i
killed him  why may not he rise as well as i 
nothing confutes me but eyes  and nobody sees me 
therefore  sirrah 
stabbing him
with a new wound in your thigh  come you along with me 
takes up hotspur on his back
re enter prince henry and lord john of lancaster


prince henry

come  brother john  full bravely hast thou flesh 
thy maiden sword 


lancaster

                  but  soft  whom have we here 
did you not tell me this fat man was dead 


prince henry

i did  i saw him dead 
breathless and bleeding on the ground  art
thou alive 
or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight 
i prithee  speak  we will not trust our eyes
without our ears  thou art not what thou seem st 


falstaff

no  that certain  i am not a double man  but if i
be not jack falstaff  then am i a jack  there is percy 
throwing the body down
if your father will do me any honour  so  if not  let
him kill the next percy himself  i look to be either
earl or duke  i can assure you 


prince henry

why  percy i killed myself and saw thee dead 


falstaff

didst thou  lord  lord  how this world is given to
lying  i grant you i was down and out of breath 
and so was he  but we rose both at an instant and
fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock  if i may be
believed  so  if not  let them that should reward
valour bear the sin upon their own heads  i take
it upon my death  i gave him this wound in the
thigh  if the man were alive and would deny it 
 zounds  i would make him eat a piece of my sword 


lancaster

this is the strangest tale that ever i heard 


prince henry

this is the strangest fellow  brother john 
come  bring your luggage nobly on your back 
for my part  if a lie may do thee grace 
i gild it with the happiest terms i have 
a retreat is sounded
the trumpet sounds retreat  the day is ours 
come  brother  let us to the highest of the field 
to see what friends are living  who are dead 
exeunt prince henry and lancaster


falstaff

i follow  as they say  for reward  he that
rewards me  god reward him  if i do grow great 
i grow less  for i purge  and leave sack  and
live cleanly as a nobleman should do
