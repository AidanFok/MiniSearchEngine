nay  but this dotage of our general 
o the measure  those his goodly eyes 
that o the files and musters of the war
have glow like plated mars  now bend  now turn 
the office and devotion of their view
upon a tawny front  his captain heart 
which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
the buckles on his breast  reneges all temper 
and is become the bellows and the fan
to cool a gipsy lust 
flourish  enter antony  cleopatra  her ladies  the train  with eunuchs fanning her
look  where they come 
take but good note  and you shall see in him 
the triple pillar of the world transform 
into a strumpet fool  behold and see 


cleopatra

mark antony

grates me  the sum 


cleopatra

nay  hear them  antony 
fulvia perchance is angry  or  who knows
if the scarce bearded caesar have not sent
his powerful mandate to you   this  or this 
take in that kingdom  and enfranchise that 
perform  t  or else we damn thee 


mark antony

how  my love 


cleopatra

perchance  nay  and most like 
you must not stay here longer  your dismission
is come from caesar  therefore hear it  antony 
where fulvia process  caesar i would say  both 
call in the messengers  as i am egypt queen 
thou blushest  antony  and that blood of thine
is caesar homager  else so thy cheek pays shame
when shrill tongued fulvia scolds  the messengers 


mark antony

let rome in tiber melt  and the wide arch
of the ranged empire fall  here is my space 
kingdoms are clay  our dungy earth alike
feeds beast as man  the nobleness of life
is to do thus  when such a mutual pair
embracing
and such a twain can do t  in which i bind 
on pain of punishment  the world to weet
we stand up peerless 


cleopatra

excellent falsehood 
why did he marry fulvia  and not love her 
i seem the fool i am not  antony
will be himself 


mark antony

                  but stirr by cleopatra 
now  for the love of love and her soft hours 
let not confound the time with conference harsh 
there not a minute of our lives should stretch
without some pleasure now  what sport tonight 


cleopatra

hear the ambassadors 


mark antony

fie  wrangling queen 
whom every thing becomes  to chide  to laugh 
to weep  whose every passion fully strives
to make itself  in thee  fair and admired 
no messenger  but thine  and all alone
to night we wander through the streets and note
the qualities of people  come  my queen 
last night you did desire it  speak not to us 
exeunt mark antony and cleopatra with their train


demetrius

is caesar with antonius prized so slight 


philo

sir  sometimes  when he is not antony 
he comes too short of that great property
which still should go with antony 


demetrius

i am full sorry
that he approves the common liar  who
thus speaks of him at rome  but i will hope
of better deeds to morrow  rest you happy 
exeunt
