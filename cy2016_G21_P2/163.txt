messenger

fulvia thy wife first came into the field 


mark antony

against my brother lucius 


messenger

ay 
but soon that war had end  and the time state
made friends of them  joining their force  caesar 
whose better issue in the war  from italy 
upon the first encounter  drave them 


mark antony

well  what worst 


messenger

the nature of bad news infects the teller 


mark antony

when it concerns the fool or coward  on 
things that are past are done with me   thus 
who tells me true  though in his tale lie death 
i hear him as he flatter d 


messenger

labienus 
this is stiff news hath  with his parthian force 
extended asia from euphrates 
his conquering banner shook from syria
to lydia and to ionia  whilst 


mark antony

antony  thou wouldst say 


messenger

o  my lord 


mark antony

speak to me home  mince not the general tongue 
name cleopatra as she is call in rome 
rail thou in fulvia phrase  and taunt my faults
with such full licence as both truth and malice
have power to utter  o  then we bring forth weeds 
when our quick minds lie still  and our ills told us
is as our earing  fare thee well awhile 


messenger

at your noble pleasure 
exit


mark antony

from sicyon  ho  the news  speak there 


first attendant

the man from sicyon is there such an one 


second attendant

he stays upon your will 


mark antony

let him appear 
these strong egyptian fetters i must break 
or lose myself in dotage 
enter another messenger
what are you 


second messenger

fulvia thy wife is dead 


mark antony

where died she 


second messenger

in sicyon 
her length of sickness  with what else more serious
importeth thee to know  this bears 
gives a letter


mark antony

forbear me 
exit second messenger
there a great spirit gone  thus did i desire it 
what our contempt doth often hurl from us 
we wish it ours again  the present pleasure 
by revolution lowering  does become
the opposite of itself  she good  being gone 
the hand could pluck her back that shoved her on 
i must from this enchanting queen break off 
ten thousand harms  more than the ills i know 
my idleness doth hatch  how now  enobarbus 
re enter domitius enobarbus


domitius enobarbus

what your pleasure  sir 


mark antony

i must with haste from hence 


domitius enobarbus

why  then  we kill all our women 
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them 
if they suffer our departure  death the word 


mark antony

i must be gone 


domitius enobarbus

under a compelling occasion  let women die  it were
pity to cast them away for nothing  though  between
them and a great cause  they should be esteemed
nothing  cleopatra  catching but the least noise of
this  dies instantly  i have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment  i do think there is
mettle in death  which commits some loving act upon
her  she hath such a celerity in dying 


mark antony

she is cunning past man thought 
exit alexas


domitius enobarbus

alack  sir  no  her passions are made of nothing but
the finest part of pure love  we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears  they are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report  this
cannot be cunning in her  if it be  she makes a
shower of rain as well as jove 


mark antony

would i had never seen her 


domitius enobarbus

o  sir  you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
of work  which not to have been blest withal would
have discredited your travel 


mark antony

fulvia is dead 


domitius enobarbus

sir 


mark antony

fulvia is dead 


domitius enobarbus

fulvia 


mark antony

dead 


domitius enobarbus

why  sir  give the gods a thankful sacrifice  when
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
from him  it shows to man the tailors of the earth 
comforting therein  that when old robes are worn
out  there are members to make new  if there were
no more women but fulvia  then had you indeed a cut 
and the case to be lamented  this grief is crowned
with consolation  your old smock brings forth a new
petticoat  and indeed the tears live in an onion
that should water this sorrow 


mark antony

the business she hath broached in the state
cannot endure my absence 


domitius enobarbus

and the business you have broached here cannot be
without you  especially that of cleopatra s  which
wholly depends on your abode 


mark antony

no more light answers  let our officers
have notice what we purpose  i shall break
the cause of our expedience to the queen 
and get her leave to part  for not alone
the death of fulvia  with more urgent touches 
do strongly speak to us  but the letters too
of many our contriving friends in rome
petition us at home  sextus pompeius
hath given the dare to caesar  and commands
the empire of the sea  our slippery people 
whose love is never link to the deserver
till his deserts are past  begin to throw
pompey the great and all his dignities
upon his son  who  high in name and power 
higher than both in blood and life  stands up
for the main soldier  whose quality  going on 
the sides o  the world may danger  much is breeding 
which  like the courser hair  hath yet but life 
and not a serpent poison  say  our pleasure 
to such whose place is under us  requires
our quick remove from hence 


domitius enobarbus

i shall do t
