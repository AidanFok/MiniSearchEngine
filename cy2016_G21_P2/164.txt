cleopatra

i did not send you  if you find him sad 
say i am dancing  if in mirth  report
that i am sudden sick  quick  and return 
exit alexas


charmian

madam  methinks  if you did love him dearly 
you do not hold the method to enforce
the like from him 


cleopatra

                  what should i do  i do not 


charmian

in each thing give him way  cross him nothing 


cleopatra

thou teachest like a fool  the way to lose him 


charmian

tempt him not so too far  i wish  forbear 
in time we hate that which we often fear 
but here comes antony 
enter mark antony


cleopatra

i am sick and sullen 


mark antony

i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose 


cleopatra

help me away  dear charmian  i shall fall 
it cannot be thus long  the sides of nature
will not sustain it 


mark antony

now  my dearest queen 


cleopatra

pray you  stand further from me 


mark antony

what the matter 


cleopatra

i know  by that same eye  there some good news 
what says the married woman  you may go 
would she had never given you leave to come 
let her not say  i that keep you here 
i have no power upon you  hers you are 


mark antony

the gods best know 


cleopatra

o  never was there queen
so mightily betray d  yet at the first
i saw the treasons planted 


mark antony

cleopatra 


cleopatra

why should i think you can be mine and true 
though you in swearing shake the throned gods 
who have been false to fulvia  riotous madness 
to be entangled with those mouth made vows 
which break themselves in swearing 


mark antony

most sweet queen 


cleopatra

nay  pray you  seek no colour for your going 
but bid farewell  and go  when you sued staying 
then was the time for words  no going then 
eternity was in our lips and eyes 
bliss in our brows  bent  none our parts so poor 
but was a race of heaven  they are so still 
or thou  the greatest soldier of the world 
art turn the greatest liar 


mark antony

how now  lady 


cleopatra

i would i had thy inches  thou shouldst know
there were a heart in egypt 


mark antony

hear me  queen 
the strong necessity of time commands
our services awhile  but my full heart
remains in use with you  our italy
shines o with civil swords  sextus pompeius
makes his approaches to the port of rome 
equality of two domestic powers
breed scrupulous faction  the hated  grown to strength 
are newly grown to love  the condemn pompey 
rich in his father honour  creeps apace 
into the hearts of such as have not thrived
upon the present state  whose numbers threaten 
and quietness  grown sick of rest  would purge
by any desperate change  my more particular 
and that which most with you should safe my going 
is fulvia death 


cleopatra

though age from folly could not give me freedom 
it does from childishness  can fulvia die 


mark antony

she dead  my queen 
look here  and at thy sovereign leisure read
the garboils she awaked  at the last  best 
see when and where she died 


cleopatra

o most false love 
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
with sorrowful water  now i see  i see 
in fulvia death  how mine received shall be 


mark antony

quarrel no more  but be prepared to know
the purposes i bear  which are  or cease 
as you shall give the advice  by the fire
that quickens nilus  slime  i go from hence
thy soldier  servant  making peace or war
as thou affect st 


cleopatra

                  cut my lace  charmian  come 
but let it be  i am quickly ill  and well 
so antony loves 


mark antony

                  my precious queen  forbear 
and give true evidence to his love  which stands
an honourable trial 


cleopatra

so fulvia told me 
i prithee  turn aside and weep for her 
then bid adieu to me  and say the tears
belong to egypt  good now  play one scene
of excellent dissembling  and let it look
life perfect honour 


mark antony

you heat my blood  no more 


cleopatra

you can do better yet  but this is meetly 


mark antony

now  by my sword 


cleopatra

and target  still he mends 
but this is not the best  look  prithee  charmian 
how this herculean roman does become
the carriage of his chafe 


mark antony

i leave you  lady 


cleopatra

courteous lord  one word 
sir  you and i must part  but that not it 
sir  you and i have loved  but there not it 
that you know well  something it is i would 
o  my oblivion is a very antony 
and i am all forgotten 


mark antony

but that your royalty
holds idleness your subject  i should take you
for idleness itself 


cleopatra

 sweating labour
to bear such idleness so near the heart
as cleopatra this  but  sir  forgive me 
since my becomings kill me  when they do not
eye well to you  your honour calls you hence 
therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly 
and all the gods go with you  upon your sword
sit laurel victory  and smooth success
be strew before your feet 


mark antony

let us go  come 
our separation so abides  and flies 
that thou  residing here  go yet with me 
and i  hence fleeting  here remain with thee  away 
exeunt
