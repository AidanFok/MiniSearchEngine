scene iv  rome  octavius caesar house 


enter octavius caesar  reading a letter  lepidus  and their train


octavius caesar

you may see  lepidus  and henceforth know 
it is not caesar natural vice to hate
our great competitor  from alexandria
this is the news  he fishes  drinks  and wastes
the lamps of night in revel  is not more man like
than cleopatra  nor the queen of ptolemy
more womanly than he  hardly gave audience  or
vouchsafed to think he had partners  you shall find there
a man who is the abstract of all faults
that all men follow 


lepidus

i must not think there are
evils enow to darken all his goodness 
his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven 
more fiery by night blackness  hereditary 
rather than purchased  what he cannot change 
than what he chooses 


octavius caesar

you are too indulgent  let us grant  it is not
amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy 
to give a kingdom for a mirth  to sit
and keep the turn of tippling with a slave 
to reel the streets at noon  and stand the buffet
with knaves that smell of sweat  say this
becomes him 
as his composure must be rare indeed
whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony
no way excuse his soils  when we do bear
so great weight in his lightness  if he fill 
his vacancy with his voluptuousness 
full surfeits  and the dryness of his bones 
call on him for t  but to confound such time 
that drums him from his sport  and speaks as loud
as his own state and ours to be chid
as we rate boys  who  being mature in knowledge 
pawn their experience to their present pleasure 
and so rebel to judgment 
enter a messenger


lepidus

here more news 


messenger

thy biddings have been done  and every hour 
most noble caesar  shalt thou have report
how  abroad  pompey is strong at sea 
and it appears he is beloved of those
that only have fear caesar  to the ports
the discontents repair  and men reports
give him much wrong d 


octavius caesar

i should have known no less 
it hath been taught us from the primal state 
that he which is was wish until he were 
and the ebb man  ne loved till ne worth love 
comes dear by being lack d  this common body 
like to a vagabond flag upon the stream 
goes to and back  lackeying the varying tide 
to rot itself with motion 


messenger

caesar  i bring thee word 
menecrates and menas  famous pirates 
make the sea serve them  which they ear and wound
with keels of every kind  many hot inroads
they make in italy  the borders maritime
lack blood to think on t  and flush youth revolt 
no vessel can peep forth  but  as soon
taken as seen  for pompey name strikes more
than could his war resisted 


octavius caesar

antony 
leave thy lascivious wassails  when thou once
wast beaten from modena  where thou slew 
hirtius and pansa  consuls  at thy heel
did famine follow  whom thou fought against 
though daintily brought up  with patience more
than savages could suffer  thou didst drink
the stale of horses  and the gilded puddle
which beasts would cough at  thy palate then did deign
the roughest berry on the rudest hedge 
yea  like the stag  when snow the pasture sheets 
the barks of trees thou browsed st  on the alps
it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh 
which some did die to look on  and all this 
it wounds thine honour that i speak it now 
was borne so like a soldier  that thy cheek
so much as lank not 


lepidus

 pity of him 


octavius caesar

let his shames quickly
drive him to rome   time we twain
did show ourselves i  the field  and to that end
assemble we immediate council  pompey
thrives in our idleness 


lepidus

to morrow  caesar 
i shall be furnish to inform you rightly
both what by sea and land i can be able
to front this present time 


octavius caesar

till which encounter 
it is my business too  farewell 


lepidus

farewell  my lord  what you shall know meantime
of stirs abroad  i shall beseech you  sir 
to let me be partaker 


octavius caesar

doubt not  sir 
i knew it for my bond 
exeunt
