scene v  alexandria  cleopatra palace 


enter cleopatra  charmian  iras  and mardian


cleopatra

charmian 


charmian

madam 


cleopatra

ha  ha 
give me to drink mandragora 


charmian

why  madam 


cleopatra

that i might sleep out this great gap of time
my antony is away 


charmian

                  you think of him too much 


cleopatra

o   treason 


charmian

                  madam  i trust  not so 


cleopatra

thou  eunuch mardian 


mardian

what your highness  pleasure 


cleopatra

not now to hear thee sing  i take no pleasure
in aught an eunuch has   well for thee 
that  being unseminar d  thy freer thoughts
may not fly forth of egypt  hast thou affections 


mardian

yes  gracious madam 


cleopatra

indeed 


mardian

not in deed  madam  for i can do nothing
but what indeed is honest to be done 
yet have i fierce affections  and think
what venus did with mars 


cleopatra

o charmian 
where think thou he is now  stands he  or sits he 
or does he walk  or is he on his horse 
o happy horse  to bear the weight of antony 
do bravely  horse  for wot thou whom thou movest 
the demi atlas of this earth  the arm
and burgonet of men  he speaking now 
or murmuring  where my serpent of old nile 
for so he calls me  now i feed myself
with most delicious poison  think on me 
that am with phoebus  amorous pinches black 
and wrinkled deep in time  broad fronted caesar 
when thou wast here above the ground  i was
a morsel for a monarch  and great pompey
would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow 
there would he anchor his aspect and die
with looking on his life 
enter alexas  from octavius caesar


alexas

sovereign of egypt  hail 


cleopatra

how much unlike art thou mark antony 
yet  coming from him  that great medicine hath
with his tinct gilded thee 
how goes it with my brave mark antony 


alexas

last thing he did  dear queen 
he kiss d the last of many doubled kisses 
this orient pearl  his speech sticks in my heart 


cleopatra

mine ear must pluck it thence 


alexas

 friend  quoth he 
 say  the firm roman to great egypt sends
this treasure of an oyster  at whose foot 
to mend the petty present  i will piece
her opulent throne with kingdoms  all the east 
say thou  shall call her mistress  so he nodded 
and soberly did mount an arm gaunt steed 
who neigh so high  that what i would have spoke
was beastly dumb by him 


cleopatra

what  was he sad or merry 


alexas

like to the time o  the year between the extremes
of hot and cold  he was nor sad nor merry 


cleopatra

o well divided disposition  note him 
note him good charmian   the man  but note him 
he was not sad  for he would shine on those
that make their looks by his  he was not merry 
which seem to tell them his remembrance lay
in egypt with his joy  but between both 
o heavenly mingle  be thou sad or merry 
the violence of either thee becomes 
so does it no man else  met thou my posts 


alexas

ay  madam  twenty several messengers 
why do you send so thick 


cleopatra

who born that day
when i forget to send to antony 
shall die a beggar  ink and paper  charmian 
welcome  my good alexas  did i  charmian 
ever love caesar so 


charmian

o that brave caesar 


cleopatra

be choked with such another emphasis 
say  the brave antony 


charmian

the valiant caesar 


cleopatra

by isis  i will give thee bloody teeth 
if thou with caesar paragon again
my man of men 


charmian

                  by your most gracious pardon 
i sing but after you 


cleopatra

my salad days 
when i was green in judgment  cold in blood 
to say as i said then  but  come  away 
get me ink and paper 
he shall have every day a several greeting 
or i unpeople egypt 
exeunt
