scene i  messina  pompey house 


enter pompey  menecrates  and menas  in warlike manner


pompey

if the great gods be just  they shall assist
the deeds of justest men 


menecrates

know  worthy pompey 
that what they do delay  they not deny 


pompey

whiles we are suitors to their throne  decays
the thing we sue for 


menecrates

we  ignorant of ourselves 
beg often our own harms  which the wise powers
deny us for our good  so find we profit
by losing of our prayers 


pompey

i shall do well 
the people love me  and the sea is mine 
my powers are crescent  and my auguring hope
says it will come to the full  mark antony
in egypt sits at dinner  and will make
no wars without doors  caesar gets money where
he loses hearts  lepidus flatters both 
of both is flatter d  but he neither loves 
nor either cares for him 


menas

caesar and lepidus
are in the field  a mighty strength they carry 


pompey

where have you this   false 


menas

from silvius  sir 


pompey

he dreams  i know they are in rome together 
looking for antony  but all the charms of love 
salt cleopatra  soften thy waned lip 
let witchcraft join with beauty  lust with both 
tie up the libertine in a field of feasts 
keep his brain fuming  epicurean cooks
sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite 
that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
even till a lethe dulness 
enter varrius
how now  varrius 


varrius

this is most certain that i shall deliver 
mark antony is every hour in rome
expected  since he went from egypt  
a space for further travel 


pompey

i could have given less matter
a better ear  menas  i did not think
this amorous surfeiter would have donn his helm
for such a petty war  his soldiership
is twice the other twain  but let us rear
the higher our opinion  that our stirring
can from the lap of egypt widow pluck
the ne er lust wearied antony 


menas

i cannot hope
caesar and antony shall well greet together 
his wife that dead did trespasses to caesar 
his brother warr upon him  although  i think 
not moved by antony 


pompey

i know not  menas 
how lesser enmities may give way to greater 
were not that we stand up against them all 
 pregnant they should square between
themselves 
for they have entertained cause enough
to draw their swords  but how the fear of us
may cement their divisions and bind up
the petty difference  we yet not know 
be as our gods will have t  it only stands
our lives upon to use our strongest hands 
come  menas 
exeunt
