scene ii  rome  the house of lepidus 


enter domitius enobarbus and lepidus


lepidus

good enobarbus   a worthy deed 
and shall become you well  to entreat your captain
to soft and gentle speech 


domitius enobarbus

i shall entreat him
to answer like himself  if caesar move him 
let antony look over caesar head
and speak as loud as mars  by jupiter 
were i the wearer of antonius  beard 
i would not shave to day 


lepidus

 not a time
for private stomaching 


domitius enobarbus

every time
serves for the matter that is then born in t 


lepidus

but small to greater matters must give way 


domitius enobarbus

not if the small come first 


lepidus

your speech is passion 
but  pray you  stir no embers up  here comes
the noble antony 
enter mark antony and ventidius


domitius enobarbus

                  and yonder  caesar 
enter octavius caesar  mecaenas  and agrippa


mark antony

if we compose well here  to parthia 
hark  ventidius 


octavius caesar

                  i do not know 
mecaenas  ask agrippa 


lepidus

noble friends 
that which combined us was most great  and let not
a leaner action rend us  what amiss 
may it be gently heard  when we debate
our trivial difference loud  we do commit
murder in healing wounds  then  noble partners 
the rather  for i earnestly beseech 
touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms 
nor curstness grow to the matter 


mark antony

 spoken well 
were we before our armies  and to fight 
i should do thus 
flourish


octavius caesar

welcome to rome 


mark antony

                  thank you 


octavius caesar

sit 


mark antony

sit  sir 


octavius caesar

nay  then 


mark antony

i learn  you take things ill which are not so 
or being  concern you not 


octavius caesar

i must be laugh at 
if  or for nothing or a little  i
should say myself offended  and with you
chiefly i  the world  more laugh at  that i should
once name you derogately  when to sound your name
it not concern me 


mark antony

my being in egypt  caesar 
what was to you 


octavius caesar

no more than my residing here at rome
might be to you in egypt  yet  if you there
did practise on my state  your being in egypt
might be my question 


mark antony

how intend you  practised 


octavius caesar

you may be pleased to catch at mine intent
by what did here befal me  your wife and brother
made wars upon me  and their contestation
was theme for you  you were the word of war 


mark antony

you do mistake your business  my brother never
did urge me in his act  i did inquire it 
and have my learning from some true reports 
that drew their swords with you  did he not rather
discredit my authority with yours 
and make the wars alike against my stomach 
having alike your cause  of this my letters
before did satisfy you  if you patch a quarrel 
as matter whole you have not to make it with 
it must not be with this 


octavius caesar

you praise yourself
by laying defects of judgment to me  but
you patch up your excuses 


mark antony

not so  not so 
i know you could not lack  i am certain on t 
very necessity of this thought  that i 
your partner in the cause  which he fought 
could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
which fronted mine own peace  as for my wife 
i would you had her spirit in such another 
the third o  the world is yours  which with a snaffle
you may pace easy  but not such a wife 


domitius enobarbus

would we had all such wives  that the men might go
to wars with the women 


mark antony

so much uncurbable  her garboils  caesar
made out of her impatience  which not wanted
shrewdness of policy too  i grieving grant
did you too much disquiet  for that you must
but say  i could not help it 


octavius caesar

i wrote to you
when rioting in alexandria  you
did pocket up my letters  and with taunts
did gibe my missive out of audience 


mark antony

sir 
he fell upon me ere admitted  then
three kings i had newly feasted  and did want
of what i was i  the morning  but next day
i told him of myself  which was as much
as to have ask him pardon  let this fellow
be nothing of our strife  if we contend 
out of our question wipe him 


octavius caesar

you have broken
the article of your oath  which you shall never
have tongue to charge me with 


lepidus

soft  caesar 


mark antony

no 
lepidus  let him speak 
the honour is sacred which he talks on now 
supposing that i lack it  but  on  caesar 
the article of my oath 


octavius caesar

to lend me arms and aid when i required them 
the which you both denied 


mark antony

neglected  rather 
and then when poison hours had bound me up
from mine own knowledge  as nearly as i may 
i play the penitent to you  but mine honesty
shall not make poor my greatness  nor my power
work without it  truth is  that fulvia 
to have me out of egypt  made wars here 
for which myself  the ignorant motive  do
so far ask pardon as befits mine honour
to stoop in such a case 


lepidus

 noble spoken 


mecaenas

if it might please you  to enforce no further
the griefs between ye  to forget them quite
were to remember that the present need
speaks to atone you 


lepidus

worthily spoken  mecaenas 


domitius enobarbus

or  if you borrow one another love for the
instant  you may  when you hear no more words of
pompey  return it again  you shall have time to
wrangle in when you have nothing else to do 


mark antony

thou art a soldier only  speak no more 


domitius enobarbus

that truth should be silent i had almost forgot 


mark antony

you wrong this presence  therefore speak no more 


domitius enobarbus

go to  then  your considerate stone 


octavius caesar

i do not much dislike the matter  but
the manner of his speech  for cannot be
we shall remain in friendship  our conditions
so differing in their acts  yet if i knew
what hoop should hold us stanch  from edge to edge
o  the world i would pursue it 


agrippa

give me leave  caesar 


octavius caesar

speak  agrippa 


agrippa

thou hast a sister by the mother side 
admired octavia  great mark antony
is now a widower 


octavius caesar

                  say not so  agrippa 
if cleopatra heard you  your reproof
were well deserved of rashness 


mark antony

i am not married  caesar  let me hear
agrippa further speak 


agrippa

to hold you in perpetual amity 
to make you brothers  and to knit your hearts
with an unslipping  knot  take antony
octavia to his wife  whose beauty claims
no worse a husband than the best of men 
whose virtue and whose general graces speak
that which none else can utter  by this marriage 
all little jealousies  which now seem great 
and all great fears  which now import their dangers 
would then be nothing  truths would be tales 
where now half tales be truths  her love to both
would  each to other and all loves to both 
draw after her  pardon what i have spoke 
for  a studied  not a present thought 
by duty ruminated 


mark antony

                  will caesar speak 


octavius caesar

not till he hears how antony is touch 
with what is spoke already 


mark antony

what power is in agrippa 
if i would say   agrippa  be it so 
to make this good 


octavius caesar

                  the power of caesar  and
his power unto octavia 


mark antony

may i never
to this good purpose  that so fairly shows 
dream of impediment  let me have thy hand 
further this act of grace  and from this hour
the heart of brothers govern in our loves
and sway our great designs 


octavius caesar

there is my hand 
a sister i bequeath you  whom no brother
did ever love so dearly  let her live
to join our kingdoms and our hearts  and never
fly off our loves again 


lepidus

happily  amen 


mark antony

i did not think to draw my sword  pompey 
for he hath laid strange courtesies and great
of late upon me  i must thank him only 
lest my remembrance suffer ill report 
at heel of that  defy him 


lepidus

time calls upon s 
of us must pompey presently be sought 
or else he seeks out us 


mark antony

where lies he 


octavius caesar

about the mount misenum 


mark antony

what is his strength by land 


octavius caesar

great and increasing  but by sea
he is an absolute master 


mark antony

so is the fame 
would we had spoke together  haste we for it 
yet  ere we put ourselves in arms  dispatch we
the business we have talk of 


octavius caesar

with most gladness 
and do invite you to my sister view 
whither straight i lead you 


mark antony

let us  lepidus 
not lack your company 


lepidus

noble antony 
not sickness should detain me 
flourish  exeunt octavius caesar  mark antony  and lepidus


mecaenas

welcome from egypt  sir 


domitius enobarbus

half the heart of caesar  worthy mecaenas  my
honourable friend  agrippa 


agrippa

good enobarbus 


mecaenas

we have cause to be glad that matters are so well
digested  you stayed well by  in egypt 


domitius enobarbus

ay  sir  we did sleep day out of countenance  and
made the night light with drinking 


mecaenas

eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast  and
but twelve persons there  is this true 


domitius enobarbus

this was but as a fly by an eagle  we had much more
monstrous matter of feast  which worthily deserved noting 


mecaenas

she a most triumphant lady  if report be square to
her 


domitius enobarbus

when she first met mark antony  she pursed up
his heart  upon the river of cydnus 


agrippa

there she appeared indeed  or my reporter devised
well for her 


domitius enobarbus

i will tell you 
the barge she sat in  like a burnish throne 
burn on the water  the poop was beaten gold 
purple the sails  and so perfumed that
the winds were love sick with them  the oars were silver 
which to the tune of flutes kept stroke  and made
the water which they beat to follow faster 
as amorous of their strokes  for her own person 
it beggar all description  she did lie
in her pavilion cloth of gold of tissue 
o er picturing that venus where we see
the fancy outwork nature  on each side her
stood pretty dimpled boys  like smiling cupids 
with divers colour fans  whose wind did seem
to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool 
and what they undid did 


agrippa

o  rare for antony 


domitius enobarbus

her gentlewomen  like the nereides 
so many mermaids  tended her i  the eyes 
and made their bends adornings  at the helm
a seeming mermaid steers  the silken tackle
swell with the touches of those flower soft hands 
that yarely frame the office  from the barge
a strange invisible perfume hits the sense
of the adjacent wharfs  the city cast
her people out upon her  and antony 
enthroned i  the market place  did sit alone 
whistling to the air  which  but for vacancy 
had gone to gaze on cleopatra too 
and made a gap in nature 


agrippa

rare egyptian 


domitius enobarbus

upon her landing  antony sent to her 
invited her to supper  she replied 
it should be better he became her guest 
which she entreated  our courteous antony 
whom ne the word of  no  woman heard speak 
being barber ten times o er  goes to the feast 
and for his ordinary pays his heart
for what his eyes eat only 


agrippa

royal wench 
she made great caesar lay his sword to bed 
he plough her  and she cropp d 


domitius enobarbus

i saw her once
hop forty paces through the public street 
and having lost her breath  she spoke  and panted 
that she did make defect perfection 
and  breathless  power breathe forth 


mecaenas

now antony must leave her utterly 


domitius enobarbus

never  he will not 
age cannot wither her  nor custom stale
her infinite variety  other women cloy
the appetites they feed  but she makes hungry
where most she satisfies  for vilest things
become themselves in her  that the holy priests
bless her when she is riggish 


mecaenas

if beauty  wisdom  modesty  can settle
the heart of antony  octavia is
a blessed lottery to him 


agrippa

let us go 
good enobarbus  make yourself my guest
whilst you abide here 


domitius enobarbus

humbly  sir  i thank you 
exeunt
