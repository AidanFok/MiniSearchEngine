you wager on your angling  when your diver
did hang a salt fish on his hook  which he
with fervency drew up 


cleopatra

that time o times 
i laugh him out of patience  and that night
i laugh him into patience  and next morn 
ere the ninth hour  i drunk him to his bed 
then put my tires and mantles on him  whilst

my bluest veins to kiss  a hand that kings
have lipp d  and trembled kissing 


messenger

cleopatra

why  there more gold 
but  sirrah  mark  we use
to say the dead are well  bring it to that 
the gold i give thee will i melt and pour
down thy ill uttering throat 


messenger

good madam  hear me 


cleopatra

well  go to  i will 
but there no goodness in thy face  if antony
be free and healthful so tart a favour
to trumpet such good tidings  if not well 
thou shouldst come like a fury crown with snakes 
not like a formal man 


messenger

will please you hear me 


cleopatra

i have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak st 
yet if thou say antony lives  is well 
or friends with caesar  or not captive to him

rich pearls upon thee

messenger

but yet  madam 


cleopatra

i do not like  yet  it does allay
the good precedence  fie upon  yet 
 yet  is as a gaoler to bring forth
some monstrous malefactor  prithee  friend 
pour out the pack of matter to mine ear 
the good and bad together  he friends with caesar 
in state of health thou say st  and thou say free

horrible villain  or i spurn thine eyes
like balls before me  i unhair thy head

smarting in lingering pickle 


messenger

gracious madam 
i that do bring the news made not the match 


cleopatra

say  not so  a province i will give thee 
and make thy fortunes proud  the blow thou hadst

and i will boot thee with what gift beside
thy modesty can beg

cleopatra

rogue  thou hast lived too long 
draws a knife


messenger

exit


charmian

good madam  keep yourself within yourself 
the man is innocent 


cleopatra

some innocents  not the thunderbolt 
melt egypt into nile  and kindly creatures
turn all to serpents  call the slave again 
though i am mad  i will not bite him  call 


charmian

he is afeard to come 


cleopatra

i will not hurt him 
exit charmian
these hands do lack nobility  that they strike
a meaner than myself  since i myself
have given myself the cause 
re enter charmian and messenger
come hither  sir 
though it be honest  it is never good
to bring bad news  give to a gracious message 
an host of tongues  but let ill tidings tell
themselves when they be felt 


messenger

i have done my duty 


cleopatra

is he married 
i cannot hate thee worser than i do 
if thou again say  yes 


messenger

he married  madam 


cleopatra

the gods confound thee  dost thou hold there still 


messenger

cleopatra

o  i would thou didst 
so half my egypt were submerged and made
a cistern for scaled snakes  go  get thee hence 
hadst thou narcissus in thy face  to me
thou wouldst appear most ugly  he is married 


messenger

i crave your highness  pardon 


cleopatra

he is married 


messenger

take no offence that i would not offend you 
to punish me for what you make me do 
seems much unequal  he married to octavia 


cleopatra

o  that his fault should make a knave of thee 
that art not what thou sure of  get thee hence 
the merchandise which thou hast brought from rome
are all too dear for me  lie they upon thy hand 
and be undone by  em 
exit messenger


charmian

good your highness  patience 


cleopatra

in praising antony  i have dispraised caesar 


charmian

many times  madam 


cleopatra

                  i am paid for now 
lead me from hence 
i faint  o iras  charmian   no matter 
go to the fellow  good alexas  bid him
report the feature of octavia  her years 
her inclination  let him not leave out
the colour of her hair  bring me word quickly 
exit alexas
let him for ever go let him not charmian 
though he be painted one way like a gorgon 
the other way a mars  bid you alexas
to mardian
bring me word how tall she is  pity me  charmian 
but do not speak to me  lead me to my chamber
