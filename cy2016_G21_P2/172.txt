scene vi  near misenum 


flourish  enter pompey and menas at one door   with drum and trumpet  at another  octavius caesar   mark antony  lepidus  domitius enobarbus  mecaenas  with soldiers marching


pompey

your hostages i have  so have you mine 
and we shall talk before we fight 


octavius caesar

most meet
that first we come to words  and therefore have we
our written purposes before us sent 
which  if thou hast consider d  let us know
if  tie up thy discontented sword 
and carry back to sicily much tall youth
that else must perish here 


pompey

to you all three 
the senators alone of this great world 
chief factors for the gods  i do not know
wherefore my father should revengers want 
having a son and friends  since julius caesar 
who at philippi the good brutus ghosted 
there saw you labouring for him  what was 
that moved pale cassius to conspire  and what
made the all honour d  honest roman  brutus 
with the arm rest  courtiers and beauteous freedom 
to drench the capitol  but that they would
have one man but a man  and that is it
hath made me rig my navy  at whose burthen
the anger ocean foams  with which i meant
to scourge the ingratitude that despiteful rome
cast on my noble father 


octavius caesar

take your time 


mark antony

thou canst not fear us  pompey  with thy sails 
we speak with thee at sea  at land  thou know 
how much we do o er count thee 


pompey

at land  indeed 
thou dost o er count me of my father house 
but  since the cuckoo builds not for himself 
remain in as thou mayst 


lepidus

be pleased to tell us 
for this is from the present how you take
the offers we have sent you 


octavius caesar

there the point 


mark antony

which do not be entreated to  but weigh
what it is worth embraced 


octavius caesar

and what may follow 
to try a larger fortune 


pompey

you have made me offer
of sicily  sardinia  and i must
rid all the sea of pirates  then  to send
measures of wheat to rome  this  upon
to part with unhack edges  and bear back
our targes undinted 


octavius caesar

mark antony

lepidus

that our offer 


pompey

know  then 
i came before you here a man prepared
to take this offer  but mark antony
put me to some impatience  though i lose
the praise of it by telling  you must know 
when caesar and your brother were at blows 
your mother came to sicily and did find
her welcome friendly 


mark antony

i have heard it  pompey 
and am well studied for a liberal thanks
which i do owe you 


pompey

let me have your hand 
i did not think  sir  to have met you here 


mark antony

the beds i  the east are soft  and thanks to you 
that call me timelier than my purpose hither 
for i have gain by  t 


octavius caesar

since i saw you last 
there is a change upon you 


pompey

well  i know not
what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face 
but in my bosom shall she never come 
to make my heart her vassal 


lepidus

well met here 


pompey

i hope so  lepidus  thus we are agreed 
i crave our composition may be written 
and seal between us 


octavius caesar

that the next to do 


pompey

we feast each other ere we part  and let 
draw lots who shall begin 


mark antony

that will i  pompey 


pompey

no  antony  take the lot  but  first
or last  your fine egyptian cookery
shall have the fame  i have heard that julius caesar
grew fat with feasting there 


mark antony

you have heard much 


pompey

i have fair meanings  sir 


mark antony

and fair words to them 


pompey

then so much have i heard 
and i have heard  apollodorus carried 


domitius enobarbus

no more of that  he did so 


pompey

what  i pray you 


domitius enobarbus

a certain queen to caesar in a mattress 


pompey

i know thee now  how farest thou  soldier 


domitius enobarbus

well 
and well am like to do  for  i perceive 
four feasts are toward 


pompey

let me shake thy hand 
i never hated thee  i have seen thee fight 
when i have envied thy behavior 


domitius enobarbus

sir 
i never loved you much  but i ha  praised ye 
when you have well deserved ten times as much
as i have said you did 


pompey

enjoy thy plainness 
it nothing ill becomes thee 
aboard my galley i invite you all 
will you lead  lords 


octavius caesar

mark antony

lepidus

show us the way  sir 


pompey

come 
exeunt all but menas and enobarbus


menas

 aside   thy father  pompey  would ne have
made this treaty you and i have known  sir 


domitius enobarbus

at sea  i think 


menas

we have  sir 


domitius enobarbus

you have done well by water 


menas

and you by land 


domitius enobarbus

i will praise any man that will praise me  though it
cannot be denied what i have done by land 


menas

nor what i have done by water 


domitius enobarbus

yes  something you can deny for your own
safety  you have been a great thief by sea 


menas

and you by land 


domitius enobarbus

there i deny my land service  but give me your
hand  menas  if our eyes had authority  here they
might take two thieves kissing 


menas

all men faces are true  whatsome their hands are 


domitius enobarbus

but there is never a fair woman has a true face 


menas

no slander  they steal hearts 


domitius enobarbus

we came hither to fight with you 


menas

for my part  i am sorry it is turned to a drinking 
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune 


domitius enobarbus

if he do  sure  he cannot weep back again 


menas

you said  sir  we looked not for mark antony
here  pray you  is he married to cleopatra 


domitius enobarbus

caesar sister is called octavia 


menas

true  sir  she was the wife of caius marcellus 


domitius enobarbus

but she is now the wife of marcus antonius 


menas

pray ye  sir 


domitius enobarbus

 true 


menas

then is caesar and he for ever knit together 


domitius enobarbus

if i were bound to divine of this unity  i would
not prophesy so 


menas

i think the policy of that purpose made more in the
marriage than the love of the parties 


domitius enobarbus

i think so too  but you shall find  the band that
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
very strangler of their amity  octavia is of a
holy  cold  and still conversation 


menas

who would not have his wife so 


domitius enobarbus

not he that himself is not so  which is mark antony 
he will to his egyptian dish again  then shall the
sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar  and  as
i said before  that which is the strength of their
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance  antony will use his affection where it is 
he married but his occasion here 


menas

and thus it may be  come  sir  will you aboard 
i have a health for you 


domitius enobarbus

i shall take it  sir  we have used our throats in egypt 


menas

come  let away 
exeunt
