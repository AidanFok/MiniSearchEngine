ill rooted already  the least wind i  the world
will blow them down 


second servant

lepidus is high coloured 


first servant

they have made him drink alms drink 


second servant

as they pinch one another by the disposition  he
cries out  more  reconciles them to his
entreaty  and himself to the drink 


first servant

but it raises the greater war between him and
his discretion 


second servant

why  this is to have a name in great men 
fellowship  i had as lief have a reed that will do
me no service as a partisan i could not heave 


first servant

 to octavius caesar   thus do they  sir  they take
the flow o  the nile
by certain scales i  the pyramid  they know 
by the height  the lowness  or the mean  if dearth
or foison follow  the higher nilus swells 
the more it promises  as it ebbs  the seedsman
upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain 
and shortly comes to harvest 


lepidus

you strange serpents there 


mark antony

ay  lepidus

operation of your sun  so is your crocodile

contradiction  i have heard that

lepidus

what manner o  thing is your crocodile 


mark antony

it is shaped  sir  like itself  and it is as broad
as it hath breadth  it is just so high as it is 
and moves with its own organs  it lives by that
which nourisheth it  and the elements once out of
it  it transmigrates 


lepidus

what colour is it of 


mark antony

of it own colour too

mark antony

 so  and the tears of it are wet 


octavius caesar

will this description satisfy him 


mark antony

with the health that pompey gives him  else he is a
very epicure 


pompey

 aside to menas   go hang  sir  hang  tell me of
that  away 
do as i bid you  where this cup i call for 


menas

wilt hear me 
rise from thy stool 


pompey

 aside to menas   i think thou mad

menas

but entertain it 
and  though thou think me poor  i am the man
will give thee all the world

are in thy vessel  let me cut the cable 
and  when we are put off  fall to their throats 
all there is thine 


pompey

ah  this thou shouldst have done 
and not have spoke on t  in me  villany 
in thee had been good service  thou must know 
 not my profit that does lead mine honour 
mine honour  it  repent that e thy tongue
hath so betray thine act  being done unknown 
i should have found it afterwards well done 
but must condemn it now  desist  and drink 


menas

i never follow thy pall fortunes more 
who seeks  and will not take when once  offer d 
shall never find it more

the while i place you  then the boy shall sing 
the holding every man shall bear as loud
as his strong sides can volley 
music plays  domitius enobarbus places them hand in hand
the song

plumpy bacchus with pink eyne 
in thy fats our cares be drown d 
with thy grapes our hairs be crown d
