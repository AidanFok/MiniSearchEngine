scene i  a plain in syria 


enter ventidius as it were in triumph  with silius   and other romans  officers  and soldiers  the dead body of pacorus borne before him


ventidius

now  darting parthia  art thou struck  and now
pleased fortune does of marcus crassus  death
make me revenger  bear the king son body
before our army  thy pacorus  orodes 
pays this for marcus crassus 


silius

noble ventidius 
whilst yet with parthian blood thy sword is warm 
the fugitive parthians follow  spur through media 
mesopotamia  and the shelters whither
the routed fly  so thy grand captain antony
shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
put garlands on thy head 


ventidius

o silius  silius 
i have done enough  a lower place  note well 
may make too great an act  for learn this  silius 
better to leave undone  than by our deed
acquire too high a fame when him we serve away 
caesar and antony have ever won
more in their officer than person  sossius 
one of my place in syria  his lieutenant 
for quick accumulation of renown 
which he achieved by the minute  lost his favour 
who does i  the wars more than his captain can
becomes his captain captain  and ambition 
the soldier virtue  rather makes choice of loss 
than gain which darkens him 
i could do more to do antonius good 
but  offend him  and in his offence
should my performance perish 


silius

thou hast  ventidius 
that
without the which a soldier  and his sword 
grants scarce distinction  thou wilt write to antony 


ventidius

i humbly signify what in his name 
that magical word of war  we have effected 
how  with his banners and his well paid ranks 
the ne er yet beaten horse of parthia
we have jaded out o  the field 


silius

where is he now 


ventidius

he purposeth to athens  whither  with what haste
the weight we must convey with will permit 
we shall appear before him  on there  pass along 
exeunt
