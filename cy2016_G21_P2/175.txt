scene x  another part of the plain 


canidius marcheth with his land army one way over  the stage  and taurus  the lieutenant of octavius  caesar  the other way  after their going in  is heard the noise of a sea fight


alarum  enter domitius enobarbus


domitius enobarbus

naught  naught all  naught  i can behold no longer 
the antoniad  the egyptian admiral 
with all their sixty  fly and turn the rudder 
to see mine eyes are blasted 
enter scarus


scarus

gods and goddesses 
all the whole synod of them 


domitius enobarbus

what thy passion 


scarus

the greater cantle of the world is lost
with very ignorance  we have kiss away
kingdoms and provinces 


domitius enobarbus

how appears the fight 


scarus

on our side like the token pestilence 
where death is sure  yon ribaudred nag of egypt 
whom leprosy o ertake i  the midst o  the fight 
when vantage like a pair of twins appear d 
both as the same  or rather ours the elder 
the breese upon her  like a cow in june 
hoists sails and flies 


domitius enobarbus

that i beheld 
mine eyes did sicken at the sight  and could not
endure a further view 


scarus

she once being loof d 
the noble ruin of her magic  antony 
claps on his sea wing  and  like a doting mallard 
leaving the fight in height  flies after her 
i never saw an action of such shame 
experience  manhood  honour  ne before
did violate so itself 


domitius enobarbus

alack  alack 
enter canidius


canidius

our fortune on the sea is out of breath 
and sinks most lamentably  had our general
been what he knew himself  it had gone well 
o  he has given example for our flight 
most grossly  by his own 


domitius enobarbus

ay  are you thereabouts 
why  then  good night indeed 


canidius

toward peloponnesus are they fled 


scarus

 easy to t  and there i will attend
what further comes 


canidius

to caesar will i render
my legions and my horse  six kings already
show me the way of yielding 


domitius enobarbus

i yet follow
the wounded chance of antony  though my reason
sits in the wind against me 
exeunt
