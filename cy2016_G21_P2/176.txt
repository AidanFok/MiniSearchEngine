to run and show their shoulders  friends  be gone 
i have myself resolved upon a course
which has no need of you  be gone

my very hairs do mutiny  for the white
reprove the brown for rashness  and they them
for fear and doting  friends  be gone  you shall
have letters from me to some friends that will
sweep your way for you  pray you  look not sad 
nor make replies of loathness  take the hint
which my despair proclaims  let that be left
which leaves itself  to the sea side straightway 
i will possess you of that ship and treasure

nay  do so  for  indeed  i have lost command 
therefore i pray you  i see you by and by

to the young man send humble treaties  dodge
and palter in the shifts of lowness  who
with half the bulk o  the world play as i pleased 
making and marring fortunes  you did know
how much you were my conqueror  and that
my sword  made weak by my affection  would
obey it on all cause 


cleopatra

pardon  pardon

fall not a tear  i say  one of them rates
all that is won and lost  give me a kiss 
even this repays me  we sent our schoolmaster 
is he come back  love  i am full of lead 
some wine  within there  and our viands  fortune knows
we scorn her most when most she offers blows
