scene xiii  alexandria  cleopatra palace 


enter cleopatra  domitius enobarbus  charmian  and iras


cleopatra

what shall we do  enobarbus 


domitius enobarbus

think  and die 


cleopatra

is antony or we in fault for this 


domitius enobarbus

antony only  that would make his will
lord of his reason  what though you fled
from that great face of war  whose several ranges
frighted each other  why should he follow 
the itch of his affection should not then
have nick his captainship  at such a point 
when half to half the world opposed  he being
the meered question   a shame no less
than was his loss  to course your flying flags 
and leave his navy gazing 


cleopatra

prithee  peace 
enter mark antony with euphronius  the ambassador


mark antony

is that his answer 


euphronius

ay  my lord 


mark antony

the queen shall then have courtesy  so she
will yield us up 


euphronius

                  he says so 


mark antony

let her know t 
to the boy caesar send this grizzled head 
and he will fill thy wishes to the brim
with principalities 


cleopatra

that head  my lord 


mark antony

to him again  tell him he wears the rose
of youth upon him  from which the world should note
something particular  his coin  ships  legions 
may be a coward s  whose ministers would prevail
under the service of a child as soon
as i  the command of caesar  i dare him therefore
to lay his gay comparisons apart 
and answer me declined  sword against sword 
ourselves alone  i write it  follow me 
exeunt mark antony and euphronius


domitius enobarbus

 aside   yes  like enough  high battled caesar will
unstate his happiness  and be staged to the show 
against a sworder  i see men judgments are
a parcel of their fortunes  and things outward
do draw the inward quality after them 
to suffer all alike  that he should dream 
knowing all measures  the full caesar will
answer his emptiness  caesar  thou hast subdued
his judgment too 
enter an attendant


attendant

                  a messenger from caesar 


cleopatra

what  no more ceremony  see  my women 
against the blown rose may they stop their nose
that kneel unto the buds  admit him  sir 
exit attendant


domitius enobarbus

 aside   mine honesty and i begin to square 
the loyalty well held to fools does make
our faith mere folly  yet he that can endure
to follow with allegiance a fall lord
does conquer him that did his master conquer
and earns a place i  the story 
enter thyreus


cleopatra

caesar will 


thyreus

hear it apart 


cleopatra

                  none but friends  say boldly 


thyreus

so  haply  are they friends to antony 


domitius enobarbus

he needs as many  sir  as caesar has 
or needs not us  if caesar please  our master
will leap to be his friend  for us  you know 
whose he is we are  and that is  caesar s 


thyreus

so 
thus then  thou most renown d  caesar entreats 
not to consider in what case thou stand st 
further than he is caesar 


cleopatra

go on  right royal 


thyreus

he knows that you embrace not antony
as you did love  but as you fear him 


cleopatra

o 


thyreus

the scars upon your honour  therefore  he
does pity  as constrained blemishes 
not as deserved 


cleopatra

                  he is a god  and knows
what is most right  mine honour was not yielded 
but conquer merely 


domitius enobarbus

 aside              to be sure of that 
i will ask antony  sir  sir  thou art so leaky 
that we must leave thee to thy sinking  for
thy dearest quit thee 
exit


thyreus

shall i say to caesar
what you require of him  for he partly begs
to be desired to give  it much would please him 
that of his fortunes you should make a staff
to lean upon  but it would warm his spirits 
to hear from me you had left antony 
and put yourself under his shrowd 
the universal landlord 


cleopatra

what your name 


thyreus

my name is thyreus 


cleopatra

most kind messenger 
say to great caesar this  in deputation
i kiss his conquering hand  tell him  i am prompt
to lay my crown at  feet  and there to kneel 
tell him from his all obeying breath i hear
the doom of egypt 


thyreus

 your noblest course 
wisdom and fortune combating together 
if that the former dare but what it can 
no chance may shake it  give me grace to lay
my duty on your hand 


cleopatra

your caesar father oft 
when he hath mused of taking kingdoms in 
bestow his lips on that unworthy place 
as it rain kisses 
re enter mark antony and domitius enobarbus


mark antony

favours  by jove that thunders 
what art thou  fellow 


thyreus

one that but performs
the bidding of the fullest man  and worthiest
to have command obey d 


domitius enobarbus

 aside                you will be whipp d 


mark antony

approach  there  ah  you kite  now  gods
and devils 
authority melts from me  of late  when i cried  ho 
like boys unto a muss  kings would start forth 
and cry  will  have you no ears  i am
antony yet 
enter attendants
take hence this jack  and whip him 


domitius enobarbus

 aside    better playing with a lion whelp
than with an old one dying 


mark antony

moon and stars 
whip him  were twenty of the greatest tributaries
that do acknowledge caesar  should i find them
so saucy with the hand of she here what her name 
since she was cleopatra  whip him  fellows 
till  like a boy  you see him cringe his face 
and whine aloud for mercy  take him hence 


thyreus

mark antony 


mark antony

                  tug him away  being whipp d 
bring him again  this jack of caesar shall
bear us an errand to him 
exeunt attendants with thyreus
you were half blasted ere i knew you  ha 
have i my pillow left unpress in rome 
forborne the getting of a lawful race 
and by a gem of women  to be abused
by one that looks on feeders 


cleopatra

good my lord 


mark antony

you have been a boggler ever 
but when we in our viciousness grow hard 
o misery on t the wise gods seel our eyes 
in our own filth drop our clear judgments  make us
adore our errors  laugh at s  while we strut
to our confusion 


cleopatra

                  o  is come to this 


mark antony

i found you as a morsel cold upon
dead caesar trencher  nay  you were a fragment
of cneius pompey s  besides what hotter hours 
unregister in vulgar fame  you have
luxuriously pick out  for  i am sure 
though you can guess what temperance should be 
you know not what it is 


cleopatra

wherefore is this 


mark antony

to let a fellow that will take rewards
and say  quit you  be familiar with
my playfellow  your hand  this kingly seal
and plighter of high hearts  o  that i were
upon the hill of basan  to outroar
the horned herd  for i have savage cause 
and to proclaim it civilly  were like
a halter neck which does the hangman thank
for being yare about him 
re enter attendants with thyreus
is he whipp d 


first attendant

soundly  my lord 


mark antony

                  cried he  and begg a  pardon 


first attendant

he did ask favour 


mark antony

if that thy father live  let him repent
thou wast not made his daughter  and be thou sorry
to follow caesar in his triumph  since
thou hast been whipp for following him  henceforth
the white hand of a lady fever thee 
shake thou to look on  t  get thee back to caesar 
tell him thy entertainment  look  thou say
he makes me angry with him  for he seems
proud and disdainful  harping on what i am 
not what he knew i was  he makes me angry 
and at this time most easy  to do t 
when my good stars  that were my former guides 
have empty left their orbs  and shot their fires
into the abysm of hell  if he mislike
my speech and what is done  tell him he has
hipparchus  my enfranched bondman  whom
he may at pleasure whip  or hang  or torture 
as he shall like  to quit me  urge it thou 
hence with thy stripes  begone 
exit thyreus


cleopatra

have you done yet 


mark antony

                  alack  our terrene moon
is now eclipsed  and it portends alone
the fall of antony 


cleopatra

i must stay his time 


mark antony

to flatter caesar  would you mingle eyes
with one that ties his points 


cleopatra

not know me yet 


mark antony

cold hearted toward me 


cleopatra

ah  dear  if i be so 
from my cold heart let heaven engender hail 
and poison it in the source  and the first stone
drop in my neck  as it determines  so
dissolve my life  the next caesarion smite 
till by degrees the memory of my womb 
together with my brave egyptians all 
by the discandying of this pelleted storm 
lie graveless  till the flies and gnats of nile
have buried them for prey 


mark antony

i am satisfied 
caesar sits down in alexandria  where
i will oppose his fate  our force by land
hath nobly held  our sever navy too
have knit again  and fleet  threatening most sea like 
where hast thou been  my heart  dost thou hear  lady 
if from the field i shall return once more
to kiss these lips  i will appear in blood 
i and my sword will earn our chronicle 
there hope in yet 


cleopatra

that my brave lord 


mark antony

i will be treble sinew d  hearted  breathed 
and fight maliciously  for when mine hours
were nice and lucky  men did ransom lives
of me for jests  but now i set my teeth 
and send to darkness all that stop me  come 
let have one other gaudy night  call to me
all my sad captains  fill our bowls once more 
let mock the midnight bell 


cleopatra

it is my birth day 
i had thought to have held it poor  but  since my lord
is antony again  i will be cleopatra 


mark antony

we will yet do well 


cleopatra

call all his noble captains to my lord 


mark antony

do so  we speak to them  and to night i force
the wine peep through their scars  come on  my queen 
there sap in yet  the next time i do fight 
i make death love me  for i will contend
even with his pestilent scythe 
exeunt all but domitius enobarbus


domitius enobarbus

now he outstare the lightning  to be furious 
is to be frighted out of fear  and in that mood
the dove will peck the estridge  and i see still 
a diminution in our captain brain
restores his heart  when valour preys on reason 
it eats the sword it fights with  i will seek
some way to leave him 
exit
