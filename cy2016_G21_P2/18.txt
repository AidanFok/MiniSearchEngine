bedford

hung be the heavens with black  yield day to night 
comets  importing change of times and states 
brandish your crystal tresses in the sky 
and with them scourge the bad revolting stars
that have consented unto henry death 
king henry the fifth  too famous to live long 
england ne lost a king of so much worth 


gloucester

england ne had a king until his time 
virtue he had  deserving to command 
his brandish sword did blind men with his beams 
his arms spread wider than a dragon wings 
his sparking eyes  replete with wrathful fire 
more dazzled and drove back his enemies
than mid day sun fierce bent against their faces 
what should i say  his deeds exceed all speech 
he ne lift up his hand but conquered 


exeter

we mourn in black  why mourn we not in blood 
henry is dead and never shall revive 
upon a wooden coffin we attend 
and death dishonourable victory
we with our stately presence glorify 
like captives bound to a triumphant car 
what  shall we curse the planets of mishap
that plotted thus our glory overthrow 
or shall we think the subtle witted french
conjurers and sorcerers  that afraid of him
by magic verses have contrived his end 
bishop


of winchester

he was a king bless of the king of kings 
unto the french the dreadful judgement day
so dreadful will not be as was his sight 
the battles of the lord of hosts he fought 
the church prayers made him so prosperous 


gloucester

the church  where is it  had not churchmen pray d 
his thread of life had not so soon decay d 
none do you like but an effeminate prince 
whom  like a school boy  you may over awe 
bishop


of winchester

gloucester  whate we like  thou art protector
and lookest to command the prince and realm 
thy wife is proud  she holdeth thee in awe 
more than god or religious churchmen may 


gloucester

name not religion  for thou lovest the flesh 
and ne throughout the year to church thou go 
except it be to pray against thy foes 


bedford

cease  cease these jars and rest your minds in peace 
let to the altar  heralds  wait on us 
instead of gold  we offer up our arms 
since arms avail not now that henry dead 
posterity  await for wretched years 
when at their mothers  moist eyes babes shall suck 
our isle be made a nourish of salt tears 
and none but women left to wail the dead 
henry the fifth  thy ghost i invocate 
prosper this realm  keep it from civil broils 
combat with adverse planets in the heavens 
a far more glorious star thy soul will make
than julius caesar or bright

messenger

no treachery  but want of men and money 
amongst the soldiers this is muttered 
that here you maintain several factions 
and whilst a field should be dispatch and fought 
you are disputing of your generals 
one would have lingering wars with little cost 
another would fly swift  but wanteth wings 
a third thinks  without expense at all 
by guileful fair words peace may be obtain d 
awake  awake  english nobility 
let not sloth dim your horrors new begot 
cropp are the flower de luces in your arms 
of england coat one half is cut away

my gracious lords  to add to your laments 
wherewith you now bedew king henry hearse 
i must inform you of a dismal fight
betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french 
bishop


of winchester

what  wherein talbot overcame  is so 


messenger

o  no  wherein lord talbot was o erthrown 
the circumstance i tell you more at large 
the tenth of august last this dreadful lord 
retiring from the siege of orleans 
having full scarce six thousand in his troop 
by three and twenty thousand of the french
was round encompassed and set upon 
no leisure had he to enrank his men 
he wanted pikes to set before his archers 
instead whereof sharp stakes pluck out of hedges
they pitched in the ground confusedly 
to keep the horsemen off from breaking in 
more than three hours the fight continued 
where valiant talbot above human thought
enacted wonders with his sword and lance 
hundreds he sent to hell  and none durst stand him 
here  there  and every where  enraged he flew 
the french exclaim d  the devil was in arms 
all the whole army stood agazed on him 
his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
a talbot  a talbot  cried out amain
and rush into the bowels of the battle 
here had the conquest fully been seal up 
if sir john fastolfe had not play the coward 
he  being in the vaward  placed behind
with purpose to relieve and follow them 
cowardly fled  not having struck one stroke 
hence grew the general wreck and massacre 
enclosed were they with their enemies 
a base walloon  to win the dauphin grace 
thrust talbot with a spear into the back 
whom all france with their chief assembled strength
durst not presume to look once in the face 


bedford

is talbot slain  then i will slay myself 
for living idly here in pomp and ease 
whilst such a worthy leader  wanting aid 
unto his dastard foemen is betray d 


messenger

o no  he lives  but is took prisoner 
and lord scales with him and lord hungerford 
most of the rest slaughter or took likewise 


bedford

his ransom there is none but i shall pay 
i hale the dauphin headlong from his throne 
his crown shall be the ransom of my friend 
four of their lords i change for one of ours 
farewell  my masters  to my task will i 
bonfires in france forthwith i am to make 
to keep our great saint george feast withal 
ten thousand soldiers with me i will take 
whose bloody deeds shall make all europe quake 


messenger

so you had need  for orleans is besieged 
the english army is grown weak and faint 
the earl of salisbury craveth supply 
and hardly keeps his men from mutiny 
since they  so few  watch such a multitude 


exeter

remember  lords  your oaths to henry sworn 
either to quell the dauphin utterly 
or bring him in obedience to your yoke
