mark antony

nay  nay  octavia  not only that 
that were excusable  that  and thousands more
of semblable import but he hath waged
new wars  pompey  made his will  and read it
to public ear 
spoke scantly of me  when perforce he could not
but pay me terms of honour  cold and sickly
he vented them  most narrow measure lent me 
when the best hint was given him  he not took t 
or did it from his teeth 


octavia

o my good lord 
believe not all  or  if you must believe 
stomach not all  a more unhappy lady 
if this division chance  ne stood between 
praying for both parts 
the good gods me presently 
when i shall pray   bless my lord and husband 
undo that prayer  by crying out as loud 
 o  bless my brother  husband win  win brother 
prays  and destroys the prayer  no midway
 these extremes at all 


mark antony

gentle octavia 
let your best love draw to that point  which seeks
best to preserve it  if i lose mine honour 
i lose myself  better i were not yours
than yours so branchless  but  as you requested 
yourself shall go between  s  the mean time  lady 
i raise the preparation of a war
shall stain your brother  make your soonest haste 
so your desires are yours 


octavia

thanks to my lord 
the jove of power make me most weak  most weak 
your reconciler  wars  you twain would be
as if the world should cleave  and that slain men
should solder up the rift 


mark antony

when it appears to you where this begins 
turn your displeasure that way  for our faults
can never be so equal  that your love
can equally move with them  provide your going 
choose your own company  and command what cost
your heart has mind to 
exeunt
