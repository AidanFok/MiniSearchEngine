should have an army for an usher  and
the neighs of horse to tell of her approach
long ere she did appear  the trees by the way
should have borne men  and expectation fainted 
longing for what it had not  nay  the dust
should have ascended to the roof of heaven 
raised by your populous troops  but you are come
a market maid to rome  and have prevented
the ostentation of our love  which  left unshown 
is often left unloved  we should have met you
by sea and land  supplying every stage
with an augmented greeting 


octavia

good my lord 
to come thus was i not constrain d  but did
on my free will  my lord  mark antony

welcome hither 
your letters did withhold our breaking forth 
till we perceived  both how you were wrong led 
and we in negligent danger  cheer your heart 
be you not troubled with the time  which drives
o your content these strong necessities 
but let determined things to destiny
hold unbewail their way  welcome to rome 
nothing more dear to me  you are abused
beyond the mark of thought  and the high gods 
to do you justice  make them ministers
of us and those that love you  best of comfort 
and ever welcome to us 


agrippa

welcome  lady 


mecaenas

welcome  dear madam 
each heart in rome does love and pity you 
only the adulterous antony  most large
in his abominations  turns you off 
and gives his potent regiment to a trull 
that noises it against us 


octavia

is it so  sir 


octavius caesar

most certain  sister  welcome  pray you 
be ever known to patience  my dear sister
