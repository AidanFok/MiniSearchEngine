scene vii  near actium  mark antony camp 


enter cleopatra and domitius enobarbus


cleopatra

i will be even with thee  doubt it not 


domitius enobarbus

but why  why  why 


cleopatra

thou hast forspoke my being in these wars 
and say it is not fit 


domitius enobarbus

well  is it  is it 


cleopatra

if not denounced against us  why should not we
be there in person 


domitius enobarbus

 aside   well  i could reply 
if we should serve with horse and mares together 
the horse were merely lost  the mares would bear
a soldier and his horse 


cleopatra

what is you say 


domitius enobarbus

your presence needs must puzzle antony 
take from his heart  take from his brain 
from time 
what should not then be spared  he is already
traduced for levity  and  said in rome
that photinus an eunuch and your maids
manage this war 


cleopatra

                  sink rome  and their tongues rot
that speak against us  a charge we bear i  the war 
and  as the president of my kingdom  will
appear there for a man  speak not against it 
i will not stay behind 


domitius enobarbus

nay  i have done 
here comes the emperor 
enter mark antony and canidius


mark antony

is it not strange  canidius 
that from tarentum and brundusium
he could so quickly cut the ionian sea 
and take in toryne  you have heard on t  sweet 


cleopatra

celerity is never more admired
than by the negligent 


mark antony

a good rebuke 
which might have well becomed the best of men 
to taunt at slackness  canidius  we
will fight with him by sea 


cleopatra

by sea  what else 


canidius

why will my lord do so 


mark antony

for that he dares us to t 


domitius enobarbus

so hath my lord dared him to single fight 


canidius

ay  and to wage this battle at pharsalia 
where caesar fought with pompey  but these offers 
which serve not for his vantage  be shakes off 
and so should you 


domitius enobarbus

                  your ships are not well mann d 
your mariners are muleters  reapers  people
ingross by swift impress  in caesar fleet
are those that often have  pompey fought 
their ships are yare  yours  heavy  no disgrace
shall fall you for refusing him at sea 
being prepared for land 


mark antony

by sea  by sea 


domitius enobarbus

most worthy sir  you therein throw away
the absolute soldiership you have by land 
distract your army  which doth most consist
of war mark footmen  leave unexecuted
your own renowned knowledge  quite forego
the way which promises assurance  and
give up yourself merely to chance and hazard 
from firm security 


mark antony

i fight at sea 


cleopatra

i have sixty sails  caesar none better 


mark antony

our overplus of shipping will we burn 
and  with the rest full mann d  from the head of actium
beat the approaching caesar  but if we fail 
we then can do at land 
enter a messenger
thy business 


messenger

the news is true  my lord  he is descried 
caesar has taken toryne 


mark antony

can he be there in person   impossible 
strange that power should be  canidius 
our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land 
and our twelve thousand horse  we to our ship 
away  my thetis 
enter a soldier
how now  worthy soldier 


soldier

o noble emperor  do not fight by sea 
trust not to rotten planks  do you misdoubt
this sword and these my wounds  let the egyptians
and the phoenicians go a ducking  we
have used to conquer  standing on the earth 
and fighting foot to foot 


mark antony

well  well  away 
exeunt mark antony  queen cleopatra  and domitius enobarbus


soldier

by hercules  i think i am i  the right 


canidius

soldier  thou art  but his whole action grows
not in the power on t  so our leader led 
and we are women men 


soldier

you keep by land
the legions and the horse whole  do you not 


canidius

marcus octavius  marcus justeius 
publicola  and caelius  are for sea 
but we keep whole by land  this speed of caesar 
carries beyond belief 


soldier

while he was yet in rome 
his power went out in such distractions as
beguiled all spies 


canidius

who his lieutenant  hear you 


soldier

they say  one taurus 


canidius

well i know the man 
enter a messenger


messenger

the emperor calls canidius 


canidius

with news the time with labour  and throes forth 
each minute  some 
exeunt
