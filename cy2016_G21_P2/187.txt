octavius caesar

he calls me boy  and chides  as he had power
to beat me out of egypt  my messenger
he hath whipp with rods  dares me to personal combat 
caesar to antony  let the old ruffian know
i have many other ways to die  meantime
laugh at his challenge 


mecaenas

caesar must think 
when one so great begins to rage  he hunted
even to falling  give him no breath  but now
make boot of his distraction  never anger
made good guard for itself 


octavius caesar

let our best heads
know  that to morrow the last of many battles
we mean to fight  within our files there are 
of those that served mark antony but late 
enough to fetch him in  see it done 
and feast the army  we have store to do t 
and they have earn the waste  poor antony
