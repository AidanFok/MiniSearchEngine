scene ii  france  before orleans 


sound a flourish  enter charles  alencon  and reignier  marching with drum and soldiers


charles

mars his true moving  even as in the heavens
so in the earth  to this day is not known 
late did he shine upon the english side 
now we are victors  upon us he smiles 
what towns of any moment but we have 
at pleasure here we lie near orleans 
otherwhiles the famish english  like pale ghosts 
faintly besiege us one hour in a month 


alencon

they want their porridge and their fat bull beeves 
either they must be dieted like mules
and have their provender tied to their mouths
or piteous they will look  like drowned mice 


reignier

let raise the siege  why live we idly here 
talbot is taken  whom we wont to fear 
remaineth none but mad brain salisbury 
and he may well in fretting spend his gall 
nor men nor money hath he to make war 


charles

sound  sound alarum  we will rush on them 
now for the honour of the forlorn french 
him i forgive my death that killeth me
when he sees me go back one foot or fly 
exeunt
here alarum  they are beaten back by the english with great loss  re enter charles  alencon  and reignier


charles

who ever saw the like  what men have i 
dogs  cowards  dastards  i would ne have fled 
but that they left me  my enemies 


reignier

salisbury is a desperate homicide 
he fighteth as one weary of his life 
the other lords  like lions wanting food 
do rush upon us as their hungry prey 


alencon

froissart  a countryman of ours  records 
england all olivers and rowlands bred 
during the time edward the third did reign 
more truly now may this be verified 
for none but samsons and goliases
it sendeth forth to skirmish  one to ten 
lean  raw boned rascals  who would e suppose
they had such courage and audacity 


charles

let leave this town  for they are hare brain slaves 
and hunger will enforce them to be more eager 
of old i know them  rather with their teeth
the walls they tear down than forsake the siege 


reignier

i think  by some odd gimmors or device
their arms are set like clocks  stiff to strike on 
else ne could they hold out so as they do 
by my consent  we even let them alone 


alencon

be it so 
enter the bastard of orleans


bastard of orleans

where the prince dauphin  i have news for him 


charles

bastard of orleans  thrice welcome to us 


bastard of orleans

methinks your looks are sad  your cheer appall d 
hath the late overthrow wrought this offence 
be not dismay d  for succor is at hand 
a holy maid hither with me i bring 
which by a vision sent to her from heaven
ordained is to raise this tedious siege
and drive the english forth the bounds of france 
the spirit of deep prophecy she hath 
exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome 
what past and what to come she can descry 
speak  shall i call her in  believe my words 
for they are certain and unfallible 


charles

go  call her in 
exit bastard of orleans
but first  to try her skill 
reignier  stand thou as dauphin in my place 
question her proudly  let thy looks be stern 
by this means shall we sound what skill she hath 
re enter the bastard of orleans  with joan la pucelle


reignier

fair maid  is thou wilt do these wondrous feats 


joan la pucelle

reignier  is thou that thinkest to beguile me 
where is the dauphin  come  come from behind 
i know thee well  though never seen before 
be not amazed  there nothing hid from me 
in private will i talk with thee apart 
stand back  you lords  and give us leave awhile 


reignier

she takes upon her bravely at first dash 


joan la pucelle

dauphin  i am by birth a shepherd daughter 
my wit untrain in any kind of art 
heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleased
to shine on my contemptible estate 
lo  whilst i waited on my tender lambs 
and to sun parching heat display my cheeks 
god mother deigned to appear to me
and in a vision full of majesty
will me to leave my base vocation
and free my country from calamity 
her aid she promised and assured success 
in complete glory she reveal herself 
and  whereas i was black and swart before 
with those clear rays which she infused on me
that beauty am i bless with which you see 
ask me what question thou canst possible 
and i will answer unpremeditated 
my courage try by combat  if thou darest 
and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex 
resolve on this  thou shalt be fortunate 
if thou receive me for thy warlike mate 


charles

thou hast astonish me with thy high terms 
only this proof i of thy valour make 
in single combat thou shalt buckle with me 
and if thou vanquishest  thy words are true 
otherwise i renounce all confidence 


joan la pucelle

i am prepared  here is my keen edged sword 
deck with five flower de luces on each side 
the which at touraine  in saint katharine 
churchyard 
out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth 


charles

then come  o  god name  i fear no woman 


joan la pucelle

and while i live  i ne fly from a man 
here they fight  and joan la pucelle overcomes


charles

stay  stay thy hands  thou art an amazon
and fightest with the sword of deborah 


joan la pucelle

christ mother helps me  else i were too weak 


charles

whoe helps thee   thou that must help me 
impatiently i burn with thy desire 
my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued 
excellent pucelle  if thy name be so 
let me thy servant and not sovereign be 
 the french dauphin sueth to thee thus 


joan la pucelle

i must not yield to any rites of love 
for my profession sacred from above 
when i have chased all thy foes from hence 
then will i think upon a recompense 


charles

meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall 


reignier

my lord  methinks  is very long in talk 


alencon

doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock 
else ne could he so long protract his speech 


reignier

shall we disturb him  since he keeps no mean 


alencon

he may mean more than we poor men do know 
these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues 


reignier

my lord  where are you  what devise you on 
shall we give over orleans  or no 


joan la pucelle

why  no  i say  distrustful recreants 
fight till the last gasp  i will be your guard 


charles

what she says i confirm  we fight it out 


joan la pucelle

assign am i to be the english scourge 
this night the siege assuredly i raise 
expect saint martin summer  halcyon days 
since i have entered into these wars 
glory is like a circle in the water 
which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
till by broad spreading it disperse to nought 
with henry death the english circle ends 
dispersed are the glories it included 
now am i like that proud insulting ship
which caesar and his fortune bare at once 


charles

was mahomet inspired with a dove 
thou with an eagle art inspired then 
helen  the mother of great constantine 
nor yet saint philip daughters  were like thee 
bright star of venus  fall down on the earth 
how may i reverently worship thee enough 


alencon

leave off delays  and let us raise the siege 


reignier

woman  do what thou canst to save our honours 
drive them from orleans and be immortalized 


charles

presently we try  come  let away about it 
no prophet will i trust  if she prove false
