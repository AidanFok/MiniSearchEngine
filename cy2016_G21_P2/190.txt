in cleopatra sails their nests  the augurers
say they know not  they cannot tell  look grimly 
and dare not speak their knowledge  antony

his fretted fortunes give him hope  and fear

my fleet hath yielded to the foe  and yonder
they cast their caps up and carouse together
like friends long lost  triple turn whore

hast sold me to this novice  and my heart
makes only wars on thee  bid them all fly 
for when i am revenged upon my charm 
i have done all  bid them all fly  begone 
exit scarus
o sun  thy uprise shall i see no more

do we shake hands  all come to this  the hearts
that spaniel me at heels  to whom i gave
their wishes  do discandy  melt their sweets
on blossoming caesar  and this pine is bark d

o this false soul of egypt  this grave charm 
whose eye beck forth my wars  and call them home 
whose bosom was my crownet  my chief end 
like a right gipsy  hath  at fast and loose 
beguiled me to the very heart of loss

and blemish caesar triumph  let him take thee 
and hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians 
follow his chariot  like the greatest spot
of all thy sex  most monster like  be shown
for poor diminutives  for doits  and let
patient octavia plough thy visage up
with her prepared nails 
exit cleopatra
 well thou gone 
if it be well to live  but better  
thou fell into my fury  for one death
might have prevented many  eros  ho 
the shirt of nessus is upon me  teach me 
alcides  thou mine ancestor  thy rage 
let me lodge lichas on the horns o  the moon 
and with those hands  that grasp the heaviest club 
subdue my worthiest self  the witch shall die 
to the young roman boy she hath sold me  and i fall
under this plot  she dies for t  eros  ho
