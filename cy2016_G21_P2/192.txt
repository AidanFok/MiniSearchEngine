eros

ay  noble lord 


mark antony

sometimes we see a cloud that dragonish 
a vapour sometime like a bear or lion 
a tower citadel  a pendent rock 
a forked mountain  or blue promontory
with trees upon t  that nod unto the world 
and mock our eyes with air  thou hast seen
these signs 
they are black vesper pageants 


eros

ay  my lord 


mark antony

the rack dislimns  and makes it indistinct 
as water is in water

mark antony

my good knave eros  now thy captain is
even such a body  here i am antony 
yet cannot hold this visible shape  my knave 
i made these wars for egypt  and the queen 
whose heart i thought i had  for she had mine 
which whilst it was mine had annex unto 
a million more  now lost she  eros  has
pack cards with caesar  and false play my glory

death of one person can be paid but once 
and that she has discharged  what thou wouldst do
is done unto thy hand  the last she spake
was  antony  most noble antony 
then in the midst a tearing groan did break
the name of antony  it was divided
between her heart and lips  she render life 
thy name so buried in her 


mark antony

weep for my pardon  so it must be  for now
all length is torture  since the torch is out 
lie down  and stray no farther  now all labour
mars what it does  yea  very force entangles
itself with strength  seal then  and all is done 
eros i come  my queen eros stay for me 
where souls do couch on flowers  we hand in hand 
and with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze 
dido and her aeneas shall want troops 
and all the haunt be ours  come  eros  eros

eros

what would my lord 


mark antony

since cleopatra died 
i have lived in such dishonour  that the gods
detest my baseness  i  that with my sword
quarter the world  and o green neptune back
with ships made cities  condemn myself to lack
the courage of a woman  less noble mind
than she which by her death our caesar tells
 am conqueror of myself  thou art sworn  eros 
that  when the exigent should come  which now
is come indeed  when i should see behind me
the inevitable prosecution of
disgrace and horror  that  on my command 
thou then wouldst kill me  do t  the time is come 
thou strikest not me   caesar thou defeat st 
put colour in thy cheek 


eros

the gods withhold me 
shall i do that which all the parthian darts 
though enemy  lost aim  and could not 


mark antony

eros 
wouldst thou be window in great rome and see
thy master thus with pleach arms  bending down
his corrigible neck  his face subdued
to penetrative shame  whilst the wheel seat
of fortunate caesar  drawn before him  branded
his baseness that ensued 


eros

i would not see t 


mark antony

come  then  for with a wound i must be cured 
draw that thy honest sword  which thou hast worn
most useful for thy country 


eros

o  sir  pardon me 


mark antony

when i did make thee free  sworest thou not then
to do this when i bade thee  do it at once 
or thy precedent services are all
but accidents unpurposed  draw  and come 


eros

turn from me  then  that noble countenance 
wherein the worship of the whole world lies 


mark antony

lo thee 
turning from him


eros

my sword is drawn 


mark antony

                  then let it do at once
the thing why thou hast drawn it 


eros

my captain  and my emperor  let me say 
before i strike this bloody stroke  farewell 


mark antony

 said  man  and farewell 


eros

farewell  great chief  shall i strike now

of antony death

mark antony

                  thrice nobler than myself 
thou teachest me  o valiant eros  what
i should  and thou couldst not  my queen and eros
have by their brave instruction got upon me
a nobleness in record  but i will be
a bridegroom in my death  and run into
