scene xv  the same  a monument 


enter cleopatra and her maids aloft  with charmian and iras


cleopatra

o charmian  i will never go from hence 


charmian

be comforted  dear madam 


cleopatra

no  i will not 
all strange and terrible events are welcome 
but comforts we despise  our size of sorrow 
proportion to our cause  must be as great
as that which makes it 
enter  below  diomedes
how now  is he dead 


diomedes

his death upon him  but not dead 
look out o  the other side your monument 
his guard have brought him thither 
enter  below  mark antony  borne by the guard


cleopatra

o sun 
burn the great sphere thou movest in 
darkling stand
the varying shore o  the world  o antony 
antony  antony  help  charmian  help  iras  help 
help  friends below  let draw him hither 


mark antony

peace 
not caesar valour hath o antony 
but antony hath triumph on itself 


cleopatra

so it should be  that none but antony
should conquer antony  but woe  so 


mark antony

i am dying  egypt  dying  only
i here importune death awhile  until
of many thousand kisses the poor last
i lay up thy lips 


cleopatra

                  i dare not  dear 
dear my lord  pardon i dare not 
lest i be taken  not the imperious show
of the full fortuned caesar ever shall
be brooch with me  if knife  drugs 
serpents  have
edge  sting  or operation  i am safe 
your wife octavia  with her modest eyes
and still conclusion  shall acquire no honour
demuring upon me  but come  come  antony 
help me  my women we must draw thee up 
assist  good friends 


mark antony

o  quick  or i am gone 


cleopatra

here sport indeed  how heavy weighs my lord 
our strength is all gone into heaviness 
that makes the weight  had i great juno power 
the strong wing mercury should fetch thee up 
and set thee by jove side  yet come a little 
wishes were ever fools o  come  come  come 
they heave mark antony aloft to cleopatra
and welcome  welcome  die where thou hast lived 
quicken with kissing  had my lips that power 
thus would i wear them out 


all

a heavy sight 


mark antony

i am dying  egypt  dying 
give me some wine  and let me speak a little 


cleopatra

no  let me speak  and let me rail so high 
that the false housewife fortune break her wheel 
provoked by my offence 


mark antony

one word  sweet queen 
of caesar seek your honour  with your safety  o 


cleopatra

they do not go together 


mark antony

gentle  hear me 
none about caesar trust but proculeius 


cleopatra

my resolution and my hands i trust 
none about caesar 


mark antony

the miserable change now at my end
lament nor sorrow at  but please your thoughts
in feeding them with those my former fortunes
wherein i lived  the greatest prince o  the world 
the noblest  and do now not basely die 
not cowardly put off my helmet to
my countryman a roman by a roman
valiantly vanquish d  now my spirit is going 
i can no more 


cleopatra

                  noblest of men  woo die 
hast thou no care of me  shall i abide
in this dull world  which in thy absence is
no better than a sty  o  see  my women 
mark antony dies
the crown o  the earth doth melt  my lord 
o  wither is the garland of the war 
the soldier pole is fall n  young boys and girls
are level now with men  the odds is gone 
and there is nothing left remarkable
beneath the visiting moon 
faints


charmian

o  quietness  lady 


iras

she is dead too  our sovereign 


charmian

lady 


iras

madam 


charmian

o madam  madam  madam 


iras

royal egypt  empress 


charmian

peace  peace  iras 


cleopatra

no more  but e a woman  and commanded
by such poor passion as the maid that milks
and does the meanest chares  it were for me
to throw my sceptre at the injurious gods 
to tell them that this world did equal theirs
till they had stol our jewel  all but naught 
patience is scottish  and impatience does
become a dog that mad  then is it sin
to rush into the secret house of death 
ere death dare come to us  how do you  women 
what  what  good cheer  why  how now  charmian 
my noble girls  ah  women  women  look 
our lamp is spent  it out  good sirs  take heart 
we bury him  and then  what brave 
what noble 
let do it after the high roman fashion 
and make death proud to take us  come  away 
this case of that huge spirit now is cold 
ah  women  women  come  we have no friend
but resolution  and the briefest end 
exeunt  those above bearing off mark antony body
