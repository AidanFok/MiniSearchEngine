he is twenty men to one

to morrow  soldier 
by sea and land i fight  or i will live 
or bathe my dying honour in the blood

domitius enobarbus

i strike  and cry  all 


mark antony

well said  come on 
call forth my household servants  let to night
be bounteous at our meal

and kings have been your fellows 


cleopatra

 aside to domitius enobarbus   what means this 


domitius enobarbus

 aside to cleopatra    one of those odd
tricks which sorrow shoots
out of the mind 


mark antony

                  and thou art honest too 
i wish i could be made so many men 
and all of you clapp up together in
an antony  that i might do you service
so good as you have done 


all

the gods forbid 


mark antony

well  my good fellows  wait on me to night 
scant not my cups  and make as much of me
as when mine empire was your fellow too 
and suffer my command 


cleopatra

 aside to domitius enobarbus   what does he mean 


domitius enobarbus

 aside to cleopatra   to make his followers weep 


mark antony

tend me to night 
may be it is the period of your duty 
haply you shall not see me more  or if 
a mangled shadow  perchance to morrow
you serve another master  i look on you
as one that takes his leave  mine honest friends 
i turn you not away  but  like a master
married to your good service  stay till death 
tend me to night two hours  i ask no more 
and the gods yield you for t 


domitius enobarbus

what mean you  sir 
to give them this discomfort  look  they weep 
and i  an ass  am onion eyed  for shame 
transform us not to women 


mark antony

ho  ho  ho 
now the witch take me  if i meant it thus 
grace grow where those drops fall 
my hearty friends 
you take me in too dolorous a sense 
for i spake to you for your comfort  did desire you
to burn this night with torches  know  my hearts 
i hope well of to morrow  and will lead you
where rather i expect victorious life
than death and honour  let to supper  come 
and drown consideration 
exeunt
