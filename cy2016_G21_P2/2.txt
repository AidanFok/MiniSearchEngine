enter the king  northumberland  worcester  hotspur  sir walter blunt  with others


king henry iv

my blood hath been too cold and temperate 
unapt to stir at these indignities 
and you have found me  for accordingly
you tread upon my patience  but be sure
i will from henceforth rather be myself 
mighty and to be fear d  than my condition 
which hath been smooth as oil  soft as young down 
and therefore lost that title of respect
which the proud soul ne pays but to the proud 


earl of worcester

our house  my sovereign liege  little deserves
the scourge of greatness to be used on it 
and that same greatness too which our own hands
have holp to make so portly 


northumberland

my lord 


king henry iv

worcester  get thee gone  for i do see
danger and disobedience in thine eye 
o  sir  your presence is too bold and peremptory 
and majesty might never yet endure
the moody frontier of a servant brow 
you have good leave to leave us  when we need
your use and counsel  we shall send for you 
exit worcester
you were about to speak 
to north


northumberland

yea  my good lord 
those prisoners in your highness  name demanded 
which harry percy here at holmedon took 
were  as he says  not with such strength denied
as is deliver to your majesty 
either envy  therefore  or misprison
is guilty of this fault and not my son 


hotspur

my liege  i did deny no prisoners 
but i remember  when the fight was done 
when i was dry with rage and extreme toil 
breathless and faint  leaning upon my sword 
came there a certain lord  neat  and trimly dress d 
fresh as a bridegroom  and his chin new reap 
show like a stubble land at harvest home 
he was perfumed like a milliner 
and  his finger and his thumb he held
a pouncet box  which ever and anon
he gave his nose and took away again 
who therewith angry  when it next came there 
took it in snuff  and still he smiled and talk d 
and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by 
he call them untaught knaves  unmannerly 
to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
betwixt the wind and his nobility 
with many holiday and lady terms
he question me  amongst the rest  demanded
my prisoners in your majesty behalf 
i then  all smarting with my wounds being cold 
to be so pester with a popinjay 
out of my grief and my impatience 
answer neglectingly i know not what 
he should or he should not  for he made me mad
to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman
of guns and drums and wounds god save the mark 
and telling me the sovereign thing on earth
was parmaceti for an inward bruise 
and that it was great pity  so it was 
this villanous salt petre should be digg 
out of the bowels of the harmless earth 
which many a good tall fellow had destroy 
so cowardly  and but for these vile guns 
he would himself have been a soldier 
this bald unjointed chat of his  my lord 
i answer indirectly  as i said 
and i beseech you  let not his report
come current for an accusation
betwixt my love and your high majesty 


sir walter blunt

the circumstance consider d  good my lord 
whate lord harry percy then had said
to such a person and in such a place 
at such a time  with all the rest retold 
may reasonably die and never rise
to do him wrong or any way impeach
what then he said  so he unsay it now 


king henry iv

why  yet he doth deny his prisoners 
but with proviso and exception 
that we at our own charge shall ransom straight
his brother in law  the foolish mortimer 
who  on my soul  hath wilfully betray 
the lives of those that he did lead to fight
against that great magician  damn glendower 
whose daughter  as we hear  the earl of march
hath lately married  shall our coffers  then 
be emptied to redeem a traitor home 
shall we but treason  and indent with fears 
when they have lost and forfeited themselves 
no  on the barren mountains let him starve 
for i shall never hold that man my friend
whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
to ransom home revolted mortimer 


hotspur

revolted mortimer 
he never did fall off  my sovereign liege 
but by the chance of war  to prove that true
needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds 
those mouthed wounds  which valiantly he took
when on the gentle severn sedgy bank 
in single opposition  hand to hand 
he did confound the best part of an hour
in changing hardiment with great glendower 
three times they breathed and three times did
they drink 
upon agreement  of swift severn flood 
who then  affrighted with their bloody looks 
ran fearfully among the trembling reeds 
and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank 
bloodstained with these valiant combatants 
never did base and rotten policy
colour her working with such deadly wounds 
nor could the noble mortimer
receive so many  and all willingly 
then let not him be slander with revolt 


king henry iv

thou dost belie him  percy  thou dost belie him 
he never did encounter with glendower 
i tell thee 
he durst as well have met the devil alone
as owen glendower for an enemy 
art thou not ashamed  but  sirrah  henceforth
let me not hear you speak of mortimer 
send me your prisoners with the speediest means 
or you shall hear in such a kind from me
as will displease you  my lord northumberland 
we licence your departure with your son 
send us your prisoners  or you will hear of it 
exeunt king henry  blunt  and train


hotspur

an if the devil come and roar for them 
i will not send them  i will after straight
and tell him so  for i will ease my heart 
albeit i make a hazard of my head 


northumberland

what  drunk with choler  stay and pause awhile 
here comes your uncle 
re enter worcester


hotspur

speak of mortimer 
 zounds  i will speak of him  and let my soul
want mercy  if i do not join with him 
yea  on his part i empty all these veins 
and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust 
but i will lift the down trod mortimer
as high in the air as this unthankful king 
as this ingrate and canker bolingbroke 


northumberland

brother  the king hath made your nephew mad 


earl of worcester

who struck this heat up after i was gone 


hotspur

he will  forsooth  have all my prisoners 
and when i urged the ransom once again
of my wife brother  then his cheek look pale 
and on my face he turn an eye of death 
trembling even at the name of mortimer 


earl of worcester

i cannot blame him  was not he proclaim 
by richard that dead is the next of blood 


northumberland

he was  i heard the proclamation 
and then it was when the unhappy king 
 whose wrongs in us god pardon did set forth
upon his irish expedition 
from whence he intercepted did return
to be deposed and shortly murdered 


earl of worcester

and for whose death we in the world wide mouth
live scandalized and foully spoken of 


hotspur

but soft  i pray you  did king richard then
proclaim my brother edmund mortimer
heir to the crown 


northumberland

he did  myself did hear it 


hotspur

nay  then i cannot blame his cousin king 
that wished him on the barren mountains starve 
but shall it be that you  that set the crown
upon the head of this forgetful man
and for his sake wear the detested blot
of murderous subornation  shall it be 
that you a world of curses undergo 
being the agents  or base second means 
the cords  the ladder  or the hangman rather 
o  pardon me that i descend so low 
to show the line and the predicament
wherein you range under this subtle king 
shall it for shame be spoken in these days 
or fill up chronicles in time to come 
that men of your nobility and power
did gage them both in an unjust behalf 
as both of you god pardon it have done 
to put down richard  that sweet lovely rose 
an plant this thorn  this canker  bolingbroke 
and shall it in more shame be further spoken 
that you are fool d  discarded and shook off
by him for whom these shames ye underwent 
no  yet time serves wherein you may redeem
your banish honours and restore yourselves
into the good thoughts of the world again 
revenge the jeering and disdain contempt
of this proud king  who studies day and night
to answer all the debt he owes to you
even with the bloody payment of your deaths 
therefore  i say 


earl of worcester

                  peace  cousin  say no more 
and now i will unclasp a secret book 
and to your quick conceiving discontents
i read you matter deep and dangerous 
as full of peril and adventurous spirit
as to o er walk a current roaring loud
on the unsteadfast footing of a spear 


hotspur

if he fall in  good night  or sink or swim 
send danger from the east unto the west 
so honour cross it from the north to south 
and let them grapple  o  the blood more stirs
to rouse a lion than to start a hare 


northumberland

imagination of some great exploit
drives him beyond the bounds of patience 


hotspur

by heaven  methinks it were an easy leap 
to pluck bright honour from the pale faced moon 
or dive into the bottom of the deep 
where fathom line could never touch the ground 
and pluck up drowned honour by the locks 
so he that doth redeem her thence might wear
without corrival  all her dignities 
but out upon this half faced fellowship 


earl of worcester

he apprehends a world of figures here 
but not the form of what he should attend 
good cousin  give me audience for a while 


hotspur

i cry you mercy 


earl of worcester

                  those same noble scots
that are your prisoners 


hotspur

i keep them all 
by god  he shall not have a scot of them 
no  if a scot would save his soul  he shall not 
i keep them  by this hand 


earl of worcester

you start away
and lend no ear unto my purposes 
those prisoners you shall keep 


hotspur

nay  i will  that flat 
he said he would not ransom mortimer 
forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer 
but i will find him when he lies asleep 
and in his ear i holla  mortimer 
nay 
i have a starling shall be taught to speak
nothing but  mortimer  and give it him
to keep his anger still in motion 


earl of worcester

hear you  cousin  a word 


hotspur

all studies here i solemnly defy 
save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke 
and that same sword and buckler prince of wales 
but that i think his father loves him not
and would be glad he met with some mischance 
i would have him poison with a pot of ale 


earl of worcester

farewell  kinsman  i talk to you
when you are better temper to attend 


northumberland

why  what a wasp stung and impatient fool
art thou to break into this woman mood 
tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own 


hotspur

why  look you  i am whipp and scourged with rods 
nettled and stung with pismires  when i hear
of this vile politician  bolingbroke 
in richard time what do you call the place 
a plague upon it  it is in gloucestershire 
 where the madcap duke his uncle kept 
his uncle york  where i first bow my knee
unto this king of smiles  this bolingbroke 
 sblood 
when you and he came back from ravenspurgh 


northumberland

at berkley castle 


hotspur

you say true 
why  what a candy deal of courtesy
this fawning greyhound then did proffer me 
look his infant fortune came to age 
and  harry percy  and  cousin 
o  the devil take such cozeners  god forgive me 
good uncle  tell your tale  i have done 


earl of worcester

nay  if you have not  to it again 
we will stay your leisure 


hotspur

i have done  i  faith 


earl of worcester

then once more to your scottish prisoners 
deliver them up without their ransom straight 
and make the douglas  son your only mean
for powers in scotland  which  for divers reasons
which i shall send you written  be assured 
will easily be granted  you  my lord 
to northumberland
your son in scotland being thus employ d 
shall secretly into the bosom creep
of that same noble prelate  well beloved 
the archbishop 


hotspur

of york  is it not 


earl of worcester

true  who bears hard
his brother death at bristol  the lord scroop 
i speak not this in estimation 
as what i think might be  but what i know
is ruminated  plotted and set down 
and only stays but to behold the face
of that occasion that shall bring it on 


hotspur

i smell it  upon my life  it will do well 


northumberland

before the game is afoot  thou still let slip 


hotspur

why  it cannot choose but be a noble plot 
and then the power of scotland and of york 
to join with mortimer  ha 


earl of worcester

and so they shall 


hotspur

in faith  it is exceedingly well aim d 


earl of worcester

and  no little reason bids us speed 
to save our heads by raising of a head 
for  bear ourselves as even as we can 
the king will always think him in our debt 
and think we think ourselves unsatisfied 
till he hath found a time to pay us home 
and see already how he doth begin
to make us strangers to his looks of love 


hotspur

he does  he does  we be revenged on him 


earl of worcester

cousin  farewell  no further go in this
than i by letters shall direct your course 
when time is ripe  which will be suddenly 
i steal to glendower and lord mortimer 
where you and douglas and our powers at once 
as i will fashion it  shall happily meet 
to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms 
which now we hold at much uncertainty 


northumberland

farewell  good brother  we shall thrive  i trust 


hotspur

uncle  adieu  o  let the hours be short
till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport 
exeunt
