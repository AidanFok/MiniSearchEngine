mark antony

we have beat him to his camp  run one before 
and let the queen know of our gests  to morrow 
before the sun shall see  s  we spill the blood
that has to day escaped  i thank you all 
for doughty handed are you  and have fought
not as you served the cause  but as  had been
each man like mine  you have shown all hectors 
enter the city  clip your wives  your friends 
tell them your feats  whilst they with joyful tears
wash the congealment from your wounds  and kiss
the honour gashes whole 
to scarus
give me thy hand
enter cleopatra  attended
to this great fairy i commend thy acts 
make her thanks bless thee 
to cleopatra
o thou day o  the world 
chain mine arm neck  leap thou  attire and all 
through proof of harness to my heart  and there
ride on the pants triumphing 


cleopatra

lord of lords 
o infinite virtue  comest thou smiling from
the world great snare uncaught 


mark antony

my nightingale 
we have beat them to their beds  what  girl 
though grey
do something mingle with our younger brown  yet ha  we
a brain that nourishes our nerves  and can
get goal for goal of youth  behold this man 
commend unto his lips thy favouring hand 
kiss it  my warrior  he hath fought to day
as if a god  in hate of mankind  had
destroy in such a shape 


cleopatra

i give thee  friend 
an armour all of gold  it was a king s 


mark antony

he has deserved it  were it carbuncled
like holy phoebus  car  give me thy hand 
through alexandria make a jolly march 
bear our hack targets like the men that owe them 
had our great palace the capacity
to camp this host  we all would sup together 
and drink carouses to the next day fate 
which promises royal peril  trumpeters 
with brazen din blast you the city ear 
make mingle with rattling tabourines 
that heaven and earth may strike their sounds together 
applauding our approach 
exeunt
