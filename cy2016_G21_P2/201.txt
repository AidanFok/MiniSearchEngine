scene ix  octavius caesar camp 


sentinels at their post


first soldier

if we be not relieved within this hour 
we must return to the court of guard  the night
is shiny  and they say we shall embattle
by the second hour i  the morn 


second soldier

this last day was
a shrewd one to s 
enter domitius enobarbus


domitius enobarbus

                  o  bear me witness  night 


third soldier

what man is this 


second soldier

                  stand close  and list him 


domitius enobarbus

be witness to me  o thou blessed moon 
when men revolted shall upon record
bear hateful memory  poor enobarbus did
before thy face repent 


first soldier

enobarbus 


third soldier

peace 
hark further 


domitius enobarbus

o sovereign mistress of true melancholy 
the poisonous damp of night disponge upon me 
that life  a very rebel to my will 
may hang no longer on me  throw my heart
against the flint and hardness of my fault 
which  being dried with grief  will break to powder 
and finish all foul thoughts  o antony 
nobler than my revolt is infamous 
forgive me in thine own particular 
but let the world rank me in register
a master leaver and a fugitive 
o antony  o antony 
dies


second soldier

let speak to him 


first soldier

let hear him  for the things he speaks
may concern caesar 


third soldier

let do so  but he sleeps 


first soldier

swoons rather  for so bad a prayer as his
was never yet for sleep 


second soldier

go we to him 


third soldier

awake  sir  awake  speak to us 


second soldier

hear you  sir 


first soldier

the hand of death hath raught him 
drums afar off
hark  the drums
demurely wake the sleepers  let us bear him
to the court of guard  he is of note  our hour
is fully out 


third soldier

come on  then 
he may recover yet 
exeunt with the body
