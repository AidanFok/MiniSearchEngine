scene i  alexandria  octavius caesar camp 


enter octavius caesar  agrippa  dolabella  mecaenas  gallus  proculeius  and others  his council of war


octavius caesar

go to him  dolabella  bid him yield 
being so frustrate  tell him he mocks
the pauses that he makes 


dolabella

caesar  i shall 
exit
enter dercetas  with the sword of mark antony


octavius caesar

wherefore is that  and what art thou that darest
appear thus to us 


dercetas

                  i am call dercetas 
mark antony i served  who best was worthy
best to be served  whilst he stood up and spoke 
he was my master  and i wore my life
to spend upon his haters  if thou please
to take me to thee  as i was to him
i be to caesar  if thou pleasest not 
i yield thee up my life 


octavius caesar

what is thou say st 


dercetas

i say  o caesar  antony is dead 


octavius caesar

the breaking of so great a thing should make
a greater crack  the round world
should have shook lions into civil streets 
and citizens to their dens  the death of antony
is not a single doom  in the name lay
a moiety of the world 


dercetas

he is dead  caesar 
not by a public minister of justice 
nor by a hired knife  but that self hand 
which writ his honour in the acts it did 
hath  with the courage which the heart did lend it 
splitted the heart  this is his sword 
i robb his wound of it  behold it stain 
with his most noble blood 


octavius caesar

look you sad  friends 
the gods rebuke me  but it is tidings
to wash the eyes of kings 


agrippa

and strange it is 
that nature must compel us to lament
our most persisted deeds 


mecaenas

his taints and honours
waged equal with him 


agrippa

a rarer spirit never
did steer humanity  but you  gods  will give us
some faults to make us men  caesar is touch d 


mecaenas

when such a spacious mirror set before him 
he needs must see himself 


octavius caesar

o antony 
i have follow thee to this  but we do lance
diseases in our bodies  i must perforce
have shown to thee such a declining day 
or look on thine  we could not stall together
in the whole world  but yet let me lament 
with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts 
that thou  my brother  my competitor
in top of all design  my mate in empire 
friend and companion in the front of war 
the arm of mine own body  and the heart
where mine his thoughts did kindle that our stars 
unreconciliable  should divide
our equalness to this  hear me  good friends 
but i will tell you at some meeter season 
enter an egyptian
the business of this man looks out of him 
we hear him what he says  whence are you 


egyptian

a poor egyptian yet  the queen my mistress 
confined in all she has  her monument 
of thy intents desires instruction 
that she preparedly may frame herself
to the way she forced to 


octavius caesar

bid her have good heart 
she soon shall know of us  by some of ours 
how honourable and how kindly we
determine for her  for caesar cannot live
to be ungentle 


egyptian

so the gods preserve thee 
exit


octavius caesar

come hither  proculeius  go and say 
we purpose her no shame  give her what comforts
the quality of her passion shall require 
lest  in her greatness  by some mortal stroke
she do defeat us  for her life in rome
would be eternal in our triumph  go 
and with your speediest bring us what she says 
and how you find of her 


proculeius

caesar  i shall 
exit


octavius caesar

gallus  go you along 
exit gallus
where dolabella 
to second proculeius 


all

dolabella 


octavius caesar

let him alone  for i remember now
how he employ d  he shall in time be ready 
go with me to my tent  where you shall see
how hardly i was drawn into this war 
how calm and gentle i proceeded still
in all my writings  go with me  and see
what i can show in this 
exeunt
