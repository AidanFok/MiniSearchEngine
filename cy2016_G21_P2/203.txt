cleopatra

my desolation does begin to make
a better life   paltry to be caesar 
not being fortune  he but fortune knave 
a minister of her will  and it is great
to do that thing that ends all other deeds 
which shackles accidents and bolts up change 
which sleeps  and never palates more the dug 
the beggar nurse and caesar s 
enter  to the gates of the monument  proculeius  gallus and soldiers


proculeius

caesar sends greeting to the queen of egypt 
and bids thee study on what fair demands
thou mean to have him grant thee 


cleopatra

what thy name 


proculeius

my name is proculeius 


cleopatra

antony
did tell me of you  bade me trust you  but
i do not greatly care to be deceived 
that have no use for trusting  if your master
would have a queen his beggar  you must tell him 
that majesty  to keep decorum  must
no less beg than a kingdom  if he please
to give me conquer egypt for my son 
he gives me so much of mine own  as i
will kneel to him with thanks 


proculeius

be of good cheer 
you fall into a princely hand  fear nothing 
make your full reference freely to my lord 
who is so full of grace  that it flows over
on all that need  let me report to him
your sweet dependency  and you shall find
a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness 
where he for grace is kneel to 


cleopatra

pray you  tell him
i am his fortune vassal  and i send him
the greatness he has got  i hourly learn
a doctrine of obedience  and would gladly
look him i  the face 


proculeius

this i report  dear lady 
have comfort  for i know your plight is pitied
of him that caused it 


gallus

you see how easily she may be surprised 
here proculeius and two of the guard ascend the  monument by a ladder placed against a window  and   having descended  come behind cleopatra  some of the guard unbar and open the gates
to proculeius and the guard
guard her till caesar come 
exit


iras

royal queen 


charmian

o cleopatra  thou art taken  queen 


cleopatra

quick  quick  good hands 
drawing a dagger


proculeius

hold  worthy lady  hold 
seizes and disarms her
do not yourself such wrong  who are in this
relieved  but not betray d 


cleopatra

what  of death too 
that rids our dogs of languish 


proculeius

cleopatra 
do not abuse my master bounty by
the undoing of yourself  let the world see
his nobleness well acted  which your death
will never let come forth 


cleopatra

where art thou  death 
come hither  come  come  come  and take a queen
worthy many babes and beggars 


proculeius

o  temperance  lady 


cleopatra

sir  i will eat no meat  i not drink  sir 
if idle talk will once be necessary 
i not sleep neither  this mortal house i ruin 
do caesar what he can  know  sir  that i
will not wait pinion at your master court 
nor once be chastised with the sober eye
of dull octavia  shall they hoist me up
and show me to the shouting varletry
of censuring rome  rather a ditch in egypt
be gentle grave unto me  rather on nilus  mud
lay me stark naked  and let the water flies
blow me into abhorring  rather make
my country high pyramides my gibbet 
and hang me up in chains 


proculeius

you do extend
these thoughts of horror further than you shall
find cause in caesar 
enter dolabella


dolabella

proculeius 
what thou hast done thy master caesar knows 
and he hath sent for thee  for the queen 
i take her to my guard 


proculeius

so  dolabella 
it shall content me best  be gentle to her 
to cleopatra
to caesar i will speak what you shall please 
if you employ me to him 


cleopatra

say  i would die 
exeunt proculeius and soldiers


dolabella

most noble empress  you have heard of me 


cleopatra

i cannot tell 


dolabella

                  assuredly you know me 


cleopatra

no matter  sir  what i have heard or known 
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams 
is not your trick 


dolabella

i understand not  madam 


cleopatra

i dream there was an emperor antony 
o  such another sleep  that i might see
but such another man 


dolabella

if it might please ye 


cleopatra

his face was as the heavens  and therein stuck
a sun and moon  which kept their course 
and lighted
the little o  the earth 


dolabella

most sovereign creature 


cleopatra

his legs bestrid the ocean  his rear arm
crested the world  his voice was propertied
as all the tuned spheres  and that to friends 
but when he meant to quail and shake the orb 
he was as rattling thunder  for his bounty 
there was no winter in t  an autumn  
that grew the more by reaping  his delights
were dolphin like  they show his back above
the element they lived in  in his livery
walk crowns and crownets  realms and islands were
as plates dropp from his pocket 


dolabella

cleopatra 


cleopatra

think you there was  or might be  such a man
as this i dream of 


dolabella

gentle madam  no 


cleopatra

you lie  up to the hearing of the gods 
but  if there be  or ever were  one such 
it past the size of dreaming  nature wants stuff
to vie strange forms with fancy  yet  to imagine
and antony  were nature piece  fancy 
condemning shadows quite 


dolabella

hear me  good madam 
your loss is as yourself  great  and you bear it
as answering to the weight  would i might never
o pursued success  but i do feel 
by the rebound of yours  a grief that smites
my very heart at root 


cleopatra

i thank you  sir 
know you what caesar means to do with me 


dolabella

i am loath to tell you what i would you knew 


cleopatra

nay  pray you  sir 


dolabella

though he be honourable 


cleopatra

he lead me  then  in triumph 


dolabella

madam  he will  i know t 
flourish  and shout within   way there  octavius caesar 
enter octavius caesar  gallus  proculeius  mecaenas  seleucus  and others of his train


octavius caesar

which is the queen of egypt 


dolabella

cleopatra kneels


octavius caesar

arise  you shall not kneel 
i pray you  rise  rise  egypt 


cleopatra

sir  the gods
will have it thus  my master and my lord
i must obey 


octavius caesar

                  take to you no hard thoughts 
the record of what injuries you did us 
though written in our flesh  we shall remember
as things but done by chance 


cleopatra

sole sir o  the world 
i cannot project mine own cause so well
to make it clear  but do confess i have
been laden with like frailties which before
have often shamed our sex 


octavius caesar

cleopatra  know 
we will extenuate rather than enforce 
if you apply yourself to our intents 
which towards you are most gentle  you shall find
a benefit in this change  but if you seek
to lay on me a cruelty  by taking
antony course  you shall bereave yourself
of my good purposes  and put your children
to that destruction which i guard them from 
if thereon you rely  i take my leave 


cleopatra

and may  through all the world   yours  and we 
your scutcheons and your signs of conquest  shall
hang in what place you please  here  my good lord 


octavius caesar

you shall advise me in all for cleopatra 


cleopatra

this is the brief of money  plate  and jewels 
i am possess of   exactly valued 
not petty things admitted  where seleucus 


seleucus

here  madam 


cleopatra

this is my treasurer  let him speak  my lord 
upon his peril  that i have reserved
to myself nothing  speak the truth  seleucus 


seleucus

madam 
i had rather seal my lips  than  to my peril 
speak that which is not 


cleopatra

what have i kept back 


seleucus

enough to purchase what you have made known 


octavius caesar

nay  blush not  cleopatra  i approve
your wisdom in the deed 


cleopatra

see  caesar  o  behold 
how pomp is follow d  mine will now be yours 
and  should we shift estates  yours would be mine 
the ingratitude of this seleucus does
even make me wild  o slave  of no more trust
than love that hired  what  goest thou back  thou shalt
go back  i warrant thee  but i catch thine eyes 
though they had wings  slave  soulless villain  dog 
o rarely base 


octavius caesar

                  good queen  let us entreat you 


cleopatra

o caesar  what a wounding shame is this 
that thou  vouchsafing here to visit me 
doing the honour of thy lordliness
to one so meek  that mine own servant should
parcel the sum of my disgraces by
addition of his envy  say  good caesar 
that i some lady trifles have reserved 
immoment toys  things of such dignity
as we greet modern friends withal  and say 
some nobler token i have kept apart
for livia and octavia  to induce
their mediation  must i be unfolded
with one that i have bred  the gods  it smites me
beneath the fall i have 
to seleucus
prithee  go hence 
or i shall show the cinders of my spirits
through the ashes of my chance  wert thou a man 
thou wouldst have mercy on me 


octavius caesar

forbear  seleucus 
exit seleucus


cleopatra

be it known  that we  the greatest  are misthought
for things that others do  and  when we fall 
we answer others  merits in our name 
are therefore to be pitied 


octavius caesar

cleopatra 
not what you have reserved  nor what acknowledged 
put we i  the roll of conquest  still be yours 
bestow it at your pleasure  and believe 
caesar no merchant  to make prize with you
of things that merchants sold  therefore be cheer d 
make not your thoughts your prisons  no  dear queen 
for we intend so to dispose you as
yourself shall give us counsel  feed  and sleep 
our care and pity is so much upon you 
that we remain your friend  and so  adieu

rank of gross diet  shall be enclouded 
and forced to drink their vapour 


iras

the gods forbid

nay   most certain  iras  saucy lictors
will catch at us  like strumpets  and scald rhymers
ballad us out o  tune  the quick comedians
extemporally will stage us  and present
our alexandrian revels  antony

iras

cleopatra

why  that the way
to fool their preparation  and to conquer
their most absurd intents 
re enter charmian

my best attires  i am again for cydnus 
to meet mark antony  sirrah iras  go

that will not be denied your highness presence 
he brings you figs 


cleopatra

let him come in 
exit guardsman
what poor an instrument
may do a noble deed  he brings me liberty 
my resolution placed  and i have nothing
of woman in me  now from head to foot
i am marble constant  now the fleeting moon
no planet is of mine 
re enter guardsman  with clown bringing in a basket


guard

this is the man 


cleopatra

avoid  and leave him 
exit guardsman
hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there 
that kills and pains not 


clown

truly  i have him  but i would not be the party
that should desire you to touch him  for his biting
is immortal  those that do die of it do seldom or
never recover 


cleopatra

rememberest thou any that have died on t 


clown

very many  men and women too  i heard of one of
them no longer than yesterday  a very honest woman 
but something given to lie  as a woman should not
do  but in the way of honesty  how she died of the
biting of it  what pain she felt  truly  she makes
a very good report o  the worm  but he that will
believe all that they say  shall never be saved by
half that they do  but this is most fallible  the
worm an odd worm 


cleopatra

get thee hence  farewell 


clown

i wish you all joy of the worm 
setting down his basket


cleopatra

farewell 


clown

you must think this  look you  that the worm will
do his kind 


cleopatra

ay  ay  farewell 


clown

look you  the worm is not to be trusted but in the
keeping of wise people  for  indeed  there is no
goodness in worm 


cleopatra

take thou no care  it shall be heeded 


clown

very good  give it nothing  i pray you  for it is
not worth the feeding 


cleopatra

will it eat me 


clown

you must not think i am so simple but i know the
devil himself will not eat a woman  i know that a
woman is a dish for the gods  if the devil dress her
not  but  truly  these same whoreson devils do the
gods great harm in their women  for in every ten
that they make  the devils mar five 


cleopatra

well  get thee gone  farewell 


clown

yes  forsooth  i wish you joy o  the worm 
exit
re enter iras with a robe  crown     c


cleopatra

give me my robe  put on my crown  i have
immortal longings in me  now no more
the juice of egypt grape shall moist this lip 
yare  yare  good iras  quick  methinks i hear
antony call  i see him rouse himself
to praise my noble act  i hear him mock
the luck of caesar  which the gods give men
to excuse their after wrath  husband  i come 
now to that name my courage prove my title 
i am fire and air  my other elements
i give to baser life  so  have you done 
come then  and take the last warmth of my lips 
farewell  kind charmian  iras  long farewell 
kisses them  iras falls and dies
have i the aspic in my lips  dost fall 
if thou and nature can so gently part 
the stroke of death is as a lover pinch 
which hurts  and is desired  dost thou lie still 
if thus thou vanishest  thou tell the world
it is not worth leave taking 


charmian

dissolve  thick cloud  and rain  that i may say 
the gods themselves do weep 


cleopatra

this proves me base 
if she first meet the curled antony 
he make demand of her  and spend that kiss
which is my heaven to have  come  thou
mortal wretch 
to an asp  which she applies to her breast
with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
of life at once untie  poor venomous fool
be angry  and dispatch  o  couldst thou speak 
that i might hear thee call great caesar ass
unpolicied 


charmian

          o eastern star 


cleopatra

peace  peace 
dost thou not see my baby at my breast 
that sucks the nurse asleep 


charmian

o  break  o  break 


cleopatra

as sweet as balm  as soft as air  as gentle 
o antony nay  i will take thee too 
applying another asp to her arm
what should i stay 
dies


charmian

in this vile world  so  fare thee well 
now boast thee  death  in thy possession lies
a lass unparallel d  downy windows  close 
and golden phoebus never be beheld
of eyes again so royal  your crown awry 
i mend it  and then play 
enter the guard  rushing in


first guard

where is the queen 


charmian

speak softly  wake her not 


first guard

caesar hath sent 


charmian

                  too slow a messenger 
applies an asp
o  come apace  dispatch  i partly feel thee 


first guard

approach  ho  all not well  caesar beguiled 


second guard

there dolabella sent from caesar  call him 


first guard

what work is here  charmian  is this well done 


charmian

it is well done  and fitting for a princess
descended of so many royal kings 
ah  soldier 
dies
re enter dolabella


dolabella

how goes it here 


second guard

                  all dead 


dolabella

caesar  thy thoughts
touch their effects in this  thyself art coming
to see perform the dreaded act which thou
so sought to hinder 
within   way there  a way for caesar 
re enter octavius caesar and all his train marching


dolabella

o sir  you are too sure an augurer 
that you did fear is done 


octavius caesar

bravest at the last 
she levell at our purposes  and  being royal 
took her own way  the manner of their deaths 
i do not see them bleed 


dolabella

who was last with them 


first guard

a simple countryman  that brought her figs 
this was his basket 


octavius caesar

poison d  then 


first guard

o caesar 
this charmian lived but now  she stood and spake 
i found her trimming up the diadem
on her dead mistress  tremblingly she stood
and on the sudden dropp d 


octavius caesar

o noble weakness 
if they had swallow poison   appear
by external swelling  but she looks like sleep 
as she would catch another antony
in her strong toil of grace 


dolabella

here  on her breast 
there is a vent of blood and something blown 
the like is on her arm 


first guard

this is an aspic trail  and these fig leaves
have slime upon them  such as the aspic leaves
upon the caves of nile 


octavius caesar

most probable
that so she died  for her physician tells me
she hath pursued conclusions infinite
of easy ways to die  take up her bed 
and bear her women from the monument 
she shall be buried by her antony 
no grave upon the earth shall clip in it
a pair so famous  high events as these
strike those that make them  and their story is
no less in pity than his glory which
brought them to be lamented  our army shall
in solemn show attend this funeral 
and then to rome  come  dolabella  see
high order in this great solemnity 
exeunt
