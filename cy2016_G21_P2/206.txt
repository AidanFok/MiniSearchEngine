scene i  the house of antipholus of ephesus 


enter adriana and luciana


adriana

neither my husband nor the slave return d 
that in such haste i sent to seek his master 
sure  luciana  it is two o clock 


luciana

perhaps some merchant hath invited him 
and from the mart he somewhere gone to dinner 
good sister  let us dine and never fret 
a man is master of his liberty 
time is their master  and  when they see time 
they go or come  if so  be patient  sister 


adriana

why should their liberty than ours be more 


luciana

because their business still lies out o  door 


adriana

look  when i serve him so  he takes it ill 


luciana

o  know he is the bridle of your will 


adriana

there none but asses will be bridled so 


luciana

why  headstrong liberty is lash with woe 
there nothing situate under heaven eye
but hath his bound  in earth  in sea  in sky 
the beasts  the fishes  and the winged fowls 
are their males  subjects and at their controls 
men  more divine  the masters of all these 
lords of the wide world and wild watery seas 
indued with intellectual sense and souls 
of more preeminence than fish and fowls 
are masters to their females  and their lords 
then let your will attend on their accords 


adriana

this servitude makes you to keep unwed 


luciana

not this  but troubles of the marriage bed 


adriana

but  were you wedded  you would bear some sway 


luciana

ere i learn love  i practise to obey 


adriana

how if your husband start some other where 


luciana

till he come home again  i would forbear 


adriana

patience unmoved  no marvel though she pause 
they can be meek that have no other cause 
a wretched soul  bruised with adversity 
we bid be quiet when we hear it cry 
but were we burdened with like weight of pain 
as much or more would we ourselves complain 
so thou  that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee 
with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me 
but  if thou live to see like right bereft 
this fool begg patience in thee will be left 


luciana

well  i will marry one day  but to try 
here comes your man  now is your husband nigh 
enter dromio of ephesus


adriana

say  is your tardy master now at hand 


dromio of ephesus

nay  he at two hands with me  and that my two ears
can witness 


adriana

say  didst thou speak with him  know thou his mind 


dromio of ephesus

ay  ay  he told his mind upon mine ear 
beshrew his hand  i scarce could understand it 


luciana

spake he so doubtfully  thou couldst not feel his meaning 


dromio of ephesus

nay  he struck so plainly  i could too well feel his
blows  and withal so doubtfully that i could scarce
understand them 


adriana

but say  i prithee  is he coming home  it seems he
hath great care to please his wife 


dromio of ephesus

why  mistress  sure my master is horn mad 


adriana

horn mad  thou villain 


dromio of ephesus

i mean not cuckold mad 
but  sure  he is stark mad 
when i desired him to come home to dinner 
he ask me for a thousand marks in gold 
 dinner time  quoth i   gold  quoth he 
 meat doth burn  quoth i   gold  quoth he 
 you come home  quoth i   gold  quoth he 
 is the thousand marks i gave thee  villain 
 pig  quoth i   burn d   gold  quoth he 
 mistress  sir  quoth i   up thy mistress 
i know not thy mistress  out on thy mistress 


luciana

quoth who 


dromio of ephesus

quoth my master 
 know  quoth he   house  no wife  no mistress 
so that my errand  due unto my tongue 
i thank him  i bare home upon my shoulders 
for  in conclusion  he did beat me there 


adriana

go back again  thou slave  and fetch him home 


dromio of ephesus

go back again  and be new beaten home 
for god sake  send some other messenger 


adriana

back  slave  or i will break thy pate across 


dromio of ephesus

and he will bless that cross with other beating 
between you i shall have a holy head 


adriana

hence  prating peasant  fetch thy master home 


dromio of ephesus

am i so round with you as you with me 
that like a football you do spurn me thus 
you spurn me hence  and he will spurn me hither 
if i last in this service  you must case me in leather 
exit


luciana

fie  how impatience loureth in your face 


adriana

his company must do his minions grace 
whilst i at home starve for a merry look 
hath homely age the alluring beauty took
from my poor cheek  then he hath wasted it 
are my discourses dull  barren my wit 
if voluble and sharp discourse be marr d 
unkindness blunts it more than marble hard 
do their gay vestments his affections bait 
that not my fault  he master of my state 
what ruins are in me that can be found 
by him not ruin d  then is he the ground
of my defeatures  my decayed fair
a sunny look of his would soon repair
but  too unruly deer  he breaks the pale
and feeds from home  poor i am but his stale 


luciana

self harming jealousy  fie  beat it hence 


adriana

unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense 
i know his eye doth homage otherwhere 
or else what lets it but he would be here 
sister  you know he promised me a chain 
would that alone  alone he would detain 
so he would keep fair quarter with his bed 
i see the jewel best enamelled
will lose his beauty  yet the gold bides still 
that others touch  and often touching will
wear gold  and no man that hath a name 
by falsehood and corruption doth it shame 
since that my beauty cannot please his eye 
i weep what left away  and weeping die 


luciana

how many fond fools serve mad jealousy 
exeunt
