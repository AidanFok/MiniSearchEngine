antipholus


of syracuse

the gold i gave to dromio is laid up
safe at the centaur  and the heedful slave
is wander forth  in care to seek me out
by computation and mine host report 
i could not speak with dromio since at first
i sent him from the mart  see  here he comes 
enter dromio of syracuse
how now sir  is your merry humour alter d 
as you love strokes  so jest with me again 
you know no centaur  you received no gold 
your mistress sent to have me home to dinner 
my house was at the phoenix  wast thou mad 
that thus so madly thou didst answer me 


dromio of syracuse

what answer  sir  when spake i such a word 
antipholus


of syracuse

even now  even here  not half an hour since 


dromio of syracuse

i did not see you since you sent me hence 
home to the centaur  with the gold you gave me 
antipholus


of syracuse

villain  thou didst deny the gold receipt 
and told me of a mistress and a dinner 
for which  i hope  thou felt i was displeased 


dromio of syracuse

i am glad to see you in this merry vein 
what means this jest  i pray you  master  tell me 
antipholus


of syracuse

yea  dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth 
think thou i jest  hold  take thou that  and that 
beating him


dromio of syracuse

hold  sir  for god sake  now your jest is earnest 
upon what bargain do you give it me 
antipholus


of syracuse

because that i familiarly sometimes
do use you for my fool and chat with you 
your sauciness will jest upon my love
and make a common of my serious hours 
when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport 
but creep in crannies when he hides his beams 
if you will jest with me  know my aspect 
and fashion your demeanor to my looks 
or i will beat this method in your sconce 


dromio of syracuse

sconce call you it  so you would leave battering  i
had rather have it a head  an you use these blows
long  i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
it too  or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders 
but  i pray  sir why am i beaten 
antipholus


of syracuse

dost thou not know 


dromio of syracuse

nothing  sir  but that i am beaten 
antipholus


of syracuse

shall i tell you why 


dromio of syracuse

ay  sir  and wherefore  for they say every why hath
a wherefore 
antipholus


of syracuse

why  first for flouting me  and then  wherefore 
for urging it the second time to me 


dromio of syracuse

was there ever any man thus beaten out of season 
when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
nor reason 
well  sir  i thank you 
antipholus


of syracuse

thank me  sir  for what 


dromio of syracuse

marry  sir  for this something that you gave me for nothing 
antipholus


of syracuse

i make you amends next  to give you nothing for
something  but say  sir  is it dinner time 


dromio of syracuse

no  sir  i think the meat wants that i have 
antipholus


of syracuse

in good time  sir  what that 


dromio of syracuse

basting 
antipholus


of syracuse

well  sir  then  be dry 


dromio of syracuse

if it be  sir  i pray you  eat none of it 
antipholus


of syracuse

your reason 


dromio of syracuse

lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
dry basting 
antipholus


of syracuse

well  sir  learn to jest in good time  there a
time for all things 


dromio of syracuse

i durst have denied that  before you were so choleric 
antipholus


of syracuse

by what rule  sir 


dromio of syracuse

marry  sir  by a rule as plain as the plain bald
pate of father time himself 
antipholus


of syracuse

let hear it 


dromio of syracuse

there no time for a man to recover his hair that
grows bald by nature 
antipholus


of syracuse

may he not do it by fine and recovery 


dromio of syracuse

yes  to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
lost hair of another man 
antipholus


of syracuse

why is time such a niggard of hair  being  as it is 
so plentiful an excrement 


dromio of syracuse

because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts 
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit 
antipholus


of syracuse

why  but there many a man hath more hair than wit 


dromio of syracuse

not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair 
antipholus


of syracuse

why  thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit 


dromio of syracuse

the plainer dealer  the sooner lost  yet he loseth
it in a kind of jollity 
antipholus


of syracuse

for what reason 


dromio of syracuse

for two  and sound ones too 
antipholus


of syracuse

nay  not sound  i pray you 


dromio of syracuse

sure ones  then 
antipholus


of syracuse

nay  not sure  in a thing falsing 


dromio of syracuse

certain ones then 
antipholus


of syracuse

name them 


dromio of syracuse

the one  to save the money that he spends in
trimming  the other  that at dinner they should not
drop in his porridge 
antipholus


of syracuse

you would all this time have proved there is no
time for all things 


dromio of syracuse

marry  and did  sir  namely  no time to recover hair
lost by nature 
antipholus


of syracuse

but your reason was not substantial  why there is no
time to recover 


dromio of syracuse

thus i mend it  time himself is bald and therefore
to the world end will have bald followers 
antipholus


of syracuse

i knew  be a bald conclusion 
but  soft  who wafts us yonder 
enter adriana and luciana


adriana

ay  ay  antipholus  look strange and frown 
some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects 
i am not adriana nor thy wife 
the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
that never words were music to thine ear 
that never object pleasing in thine eye 
that never touch well welcome to thy hand 
that never meat sweet savor in thy taste 
unless i spake  or look d  or touch d  or carved to thee 
how comes it now  my husband  o  how comes it 
that thou art thus estranged from thyself 
thyself i call it  being strange to me 
that  undividable  incorporate 
am better than thy dear self better part 
ah  do not tear away thyself from me 
for know  my love  as easy mayest thou fall
a drop of water in the breaking gulf 
and take unmingled that same drop again 
without addition or diminishing 
as take from me thyself and not me too 
how dearly would it touch me to the quick 
shouldst thou but hear i were licentious
and that this body  consecrate to thee 
by ruffian lust should be contaminate 
wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
and hurl the name of husband in my face
and tear the stain skin off my harlot brow
and from my false hand cut the wedding ring
and break it with a deep divorcing vow 
i know thou canst  and therefore see thou do it 
i am possess with an adulterate blot 
my blood is mingled with the crime of lust 
for if we too be one and thou play false 
i do digest the poison of thy flesh 
being strumpeted by thy contagion 
keep then far league and truce with thy true bed 
i live unstain d  thou undishonoured 
antipholus


of syracuse

plead you to me  fair dame  i know you not 
in ephesus i am but two hours old 
as strange unto your town as to your talk 
who  every word by all my wit being scann d 
want wit in all one word to understand 


luciana

fie  brother  how the world is changed with you 
when were you wont to use my sister thus 
she sent for you by dromio home to dinner 
antipholus


of syracuse

by dromio 


dromio of syracuse

by me 


adriana

by thee  and this thou didst return from him 
that he did buffet thee  and  in his blows 
denied my house for his  me for his wife 
antipholus


of syracuse

did you converse  sir  with this gentlewoman 
what is the course and drift of your compact 


dromio of syracuse

i  sir  i never saw her till this time 
antipholus


of syracuse

villain  thou liest  for even her very words
didst thou deliver to me on the mart 


dromio of syracuse

i never spake with her in all my life 
antipholus


of syracuse

how can she thus then call us by our names 
unless it be by inspiration 


adriana

how ill agrees it with your gravity
to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave 
abetting him to thwart me in my mood 
be it my wrong you are from me exempt 
but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt 
come  i will fasten on this sleeve of thine 
thou art an elm  my husband  i a vine 
whose weakness  married to thy stronger state 
makes me with thy strength to communicate 
if aught possess thee from me  it is dross 
usurping ivy  brier  or idle moss 
who  all for want of pruning  with intrusion
infect thy sap and live on thy confusion 
antipholus


of syracuse

to me she speaks  she moves me for her theme 
what  was i married to her in my dream 
or sleep i now and think i hear all this 
what error drives our eyes and ears amiss 
until i know this sure uncertainty 
i entertain the offer fallacy 


luciana

dromio  go bid the servants spread for dinner 


dromio of syracuse

o  for my beads  i cross me for a sinner 
this is the fairy land  o spite of spites 
we talk with goblins  owls and sprites 
if we obey them not  this will ensue 
they suck our breath  or pinch us black and blue 


luciana

why pratest thou to thyself and answer not 
dromio  thou drone  thou snail  thou slug  thou sot 


dromio of syracuse

i am transformed  master  am i not 
antipholus


of syracuse

i think thou art in mind  and so am i 


dromio of syracuse

nay  master  both in mind and in my shape 
antipholus


of syracuse

thou hast thine own form 


dromio of syracuse

no  i am an ape 


luciana

if thou art changed to aught   to an ass 


dromio of syracuse

 true  she rides me and i long for grass 
 so  i am an ass  else it could never be
but i should know her as well as she knows me 


adriana

come  come  no longer will i be a fool 
to put the finger in the eye and weep 
whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn 
come  sir  to dinner  dromio  keep the gate 
husband  i dine above with you to day
and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks 
sirrah  if any ask you for your master 
say he dines forth  and let no creature enter 
come  sister  dromio  play the porter well 
antipholus


of syracuse

am i in earth  in heaven  or in hell 
sleeping or waking  mad or well advised 
known unto these  and to myself disguised 
i say as they say and persever so 
and in this mist at all adventures go 


dromio of syracuse

master  shall i be porter at the gate 


adriana

ay  and let none enter  lest i break your pate 


luciana

come  come  antipholus  we dine too late
