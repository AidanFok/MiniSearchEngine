good signior angelo  you must excuse us all 
my wife is shrewish when i keep not hours 
say that i linger with you at your shop
to see the making of her carcanet 
and that to morrow you will bring it home 
but here a villain that would face me down
he met me on the mart  and that i beat him 
and charged him with a thousand marks in gold 
and that i did deny my wife and house 
thou drunkard  thou  what didst thou mean by this 


dromio of ephesus

say what you will  sir  but i know what i know 
that you beat me at the mart  i have your hand to show 
if the skin were parchment  and the blows you gave were ink 
your own handwriting would tell you what i think 
antipholus


of ephesus

i think thou art an ass 


dromio of ephesus

marry  so it doth appear
by the wrongs i suffer and the blows i bear 
i should kick  being kick d  and  being at that pass 
you would keep from my heels and beware of an ass 
antipholus


of ephesus

you sad  signior balthazar  pray god our cheer
may answer my good will and your good welcome here 


balthazar

i hold your dainties cheap  sir  and your
welcome dear 
antipholus


of ephesus

o  signior balthazar  either at flesh or fish 
a table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish 


balthazar

good meat  sir  is common  that every churl affords 
antipholus


of ephesus

and welcome more common  for that nothing but words 


balthazar

small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast 
antipholus


of ephesus

ay  to a niggardly host  and more sparing guest 
but though my cates be mean  take them in good part 
better cheer may you have  but not with better heart

dromio of ephesus

they stand at the door  master  bid them welcome hither 
antipholus


of ephesus

there is something in the wind  that we cannot get in 


dromio of ephesus

you would say so  master  if your garments were thin 
your cake there is warm within  you stand here in the cold 
it would make a man mad as a buck  to be so bought and sold 
antipholus


of ephesus

go fetch me something  i break ope the gate 


dromio of syracuse

 within   break any breaking here  and i break your
knave pate 


dromio of ephesus

a man may break a word with you  sir  and words are but wind 
ay  and break it in your face  so he break it not behind 


dromio of syracuse

 within   it seems thou want breaking  out upon
thee  hind

antipholus


of ephesus

go get thee gone  fetch me an iron crow 


balthazar

have patience  sir  o  let it not be so 
herein you war against your reputation
and draw within the compass of suspect
the unviolated honour of your wife 
once this your long experience of her wisdom 
her sober virtue  years and modesty 
plead on her part some cause to you unknown 
and doubt not  sir  but she will well excuse
why at this time the doors are made against you 
be ruled by me  depart in patience 
and let us to the tiger all to dinner 
and about evening come yourself alone
to know the reason of this strange restraint 
if by strong hand you offer to break in
now in the stirring passage of the day 
a vulgar comment will be made of it 
and that supposed by the common rout
against your yet ungalled estimation
that may with foul intrusion enter in
and dwell upon your grave when you are dead 
for slander lives upon succession 
for ever housed where it gets possession 
antipholus


of ephesus

you have prevailed  i will depart in quiet 
and  in despite of mirth  mean to be merry 
i know a wench of excellent discourse 
pretty and witty  wild  and yet  too  gentle 
there will we dine  this woman that i mean 
my wife but  i protest  without desert 
hath oftentimes upbraided me withal 
to her will we to dinner 
to angelo
get you home
and fetch the chain  by this i know  made 
bring it  i pray you  to the porpentine 
for there the house  that chain will i bestow 
be it for nothing but to spite my wife 
upon mine hostess there  good sir  make haste 
since mine own doors refuse to entertain me 
i knock elsewhere  to see if they disdain me 


angelo

i meet you at that place some hour hence 
antipholus


of ephesus

do so  this jest shall cost me some expense 
exeunt
