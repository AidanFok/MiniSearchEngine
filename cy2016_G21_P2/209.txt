luciana

and may it be that you have quite forgot
a husband office  shall  antipholus 
even in the spring of love  thy love springs rot 
shall love  in building  grow so ruinous 
if you did wed my sister for her wealth 
then for her wealth sake use her with more kindness 
or if you like elsewhere  do it by stealth 
muffle your false love with some show of blindness 
let not my sister read it in your eye 
be not thy tongue thy own shame orator 
look sweet  be fair  become disloyalty 
apparel vice like virtue harbinger 
bear a fair presence  though your heart be tainted 
teach sin the carriage of a holy saint 
be secret false  what need she be acquainted 
what simple thief brags of his own attaint 
 double wrong  to truant with your bed
and let her read it in thy looks at board 
shame hath a bastard fame  well managed 
ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word 
alas  poor women  make us but believe 
being compact of credit  that you love us 
though others have the arm  show us the sleeve 
we in your motion turn and you may move us 
then  gentle brother  get you in again 
comfort my sister  cheer her  call her wife 
 holy sport to be a little vain 
when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife 
antipholus


of syracuse

sweet mistress what your name is else  i know not 
nor by what wonder you do hit of mine 
less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
than our earth wonder  more than earth divine 
teach me  dear creature  how to think and speak 
lay open to my earthy gross conceit 
smother in errors  feeble  shallow  weak 
the folded meaning of your words  deceit 
against my soul pure truth why labour you
to make it wander in an unknown field 
are you a god  would you create me new 
transform me then  and to your power i yield 
but if that i am i  then well i know
your weeping sister is no wife of mine 
nor to her bed no homage do i owe
far more  far more to you do i decline 
o  train me not  sweet mermaid  with thy note 
to drown me in thy sister flood of tears 
sing  siren  for thyself and i will dote 
spread o the silver waves thy golden hairs 
and as a bed i take them and there lie 
and in that glorious supposition think
he gains by death that hath such means to die 
let love  being light  be drowned if she sink 


luciana

what  are you mad  that you do reason so 
antipholus


of syracuse

not mad  but mated  how  i do not know 


luciana

it is a fault that springeth from your eye 
antipholus


of syracuse

for gazing on your beams  fair sun  being by 


luciana

gaze where you should  and that will clear your sight 
antipholus


of syracuse

antipholus


of syracuse

dromio of syracuse

marry sir  such claim as you would lay to your
horse  and she would have me as a beast  not that  i
being a beast  she would have me  but that she 
being a very beastly creature  lays claim to me 
antipholus


of syracuse

what is she 


dromio of syracuse

a very reverent body  ay  such a one as a man may
not speak of without he say  sir reverence  i have
but lean luck in the match  and yet is she a
wondrous fat marriage 
antipholus


of syracuse

how dost thou mean a fat marriage 


dromio of syracuse

marry  sir  she the kitchen wench and all grease 
and i know not what use to put her to but to make a
lamp of her and run from her by her own light  i
warrant  her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
poland winter  if she lives till doomsday 
she burn a week longer than the whole world 
antipholus


of syracuse

what complexion is she of 


dromio of syracuse

swart  like my shoe  but her face nothing half so
clean kept  for why  she sweats  a man may go over
shoes in the grime of it 
antipholus


of syracuse

that a fault that water will mend

dromio of syracuse

nell  sir  but her name and three quarters  that 
an ell and three quarters  will not measure her from
hip to hip 
antipholus


of syracuse

then she bears some breadth 


dromio of syracuse

no longer from head to foot than from hip to hip 
she is spherical  like a globe  i could find out
countries in her 
antipholus


of syracuse

in what part of her body stands ireland 


dromio of syracuse

marry  in her buttocks  i found it out by the bogs 
antipholus


of syracuse

where scotland 


dromio of syracuse

i found it by the barrenness  hard in the palm of the hand 
antipholus


of syracuse

where france 


dromio of syracuse

in her forehead  armed and reverted  making war
against her heir 
antipholus


of syracuse

where england 


dromio of syracuse

i looked for the chalky cliffs  but i could find no
whiteness in them  but i guess it stood in her chin 
by the salt rheum that ran between france and it 
antipholus


of syracuse

where spain 


dromio of syracuse

faith  i saw it not  but i felt it hot in her breath 
antipholus


of syracuse

where america  the indies 


dromio of syracuse

oh  sir  upon her nose all o embellished with
rubies  carbuncles  sapphires  declining their rich
aspect to the hot breath of spain  who sent whole
armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose 
antipholus


of syracuse

where stood belgia  the netherlands 


dromio of syracuse

oh  sir  i did not look so low  to conclude  this
drudge  or diviner  laid claim to me  call me
dromio  swore i was assured to her  told me what
privy marks i had about me  as  the mark of my
shoulder  the mole in my neck  the great wart on my
left arm  that i amazed ran from her as a witch 
and  i think  if my breast had not been made of
faith and my heart of steel 
she had transform me to a curtal dog and made
me turn i  the wheel 
antipholus


of syracuse

go hie thee presently  post to the road 
an if the wind blow any way from shore 
i will not harbour in this town to night 
if any bark put forth  come to the mart 
where i will walk till thou return to me 
if every one knows us and we know none 
 time  i think  to trudge  pack and be gone 


dromio of syracuse

as from a bear a man would run for life 
so fly i from her that would be my wife 
exit
antipholus


of syracuse

there none but witches do inhabit here 
and therefore  high time that i were hence 
she that doth call me husband  even my soul
doth for a wife abhor  but her fair sister 
possess with such a gentle sovereign grace 
of such enchanting presence and discourse 
hath almost made me traitor to myself 
but  lest myself be guilty to self wrong 
i stop mine ears against the mermaid song 
enter angelo with the chain


angelo

master antipholus 
antipholus


of syracuse

ay  that my name

antipholus


of syracuse

go home with it and please your wife withal 
and soon at supper time i visit you
and then receive my money for the chain

of syracuse

for fear you ne see chain nor money more 


angelo

exit
antipholus


of syracuse

what i should think of this  i cannot tell 
but this i think  there no man is so vain
that would refuse so fair an offer chain 
i see a man here needs not live by shifts 
when in the streets he meets such golden gifts 
i to the mart  and there for dromio stay
if any ship put out  then straight away
