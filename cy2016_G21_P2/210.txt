belike you thought our love would last too long 
if it were chain together  and therefore came not 


angelo

saving your merry humour  here the note
how much your chain weighs to the utmost carat 
the fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion 
which doth amount to three odd ducats more
than i stand debted to this gentleman 
i pray you  see him presently discharged 
for he is bound to sea and stays but for it 
antipholus


of ephesus

i am not furnish with the present money

both wind and tide stays for this gentleman 
and i  to blame  have held him here too long 
antipholus


of ephesus

good lord  you use this dalliance to excuse
your breach of promise to the porpentine 
i should have chid you for not bringing it 
but  like a shrew  you first begin to brawl 


second merchant

the hour steals on  i pray you  sir  dispatch 


angelo

where the chain  i pray you  let me see it

antipholus


of ephesus
