scene ii  the house of antipholus of ephesus 


enter adriana and luciana


adriana

ah  luciana  did he tempt thee so 
mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
that he did plead in earnest  yea or no 
look he or red or pale  or sad or merrily 
what observation madest thou in this case
of his heart meteors tilting in his face 


luciana

first he denied you had in him no right 


adriana

he meant he did me none  the more my spite 


luciana

then swore he that he was a stranger here 


adriana

and true he swore  though yet forsworn he were 


luciana

then pleaded i for you 


adriana

and what said he 


luciana

that love i begg for you he begg of me 


adriana

with what persuasion did he tempt thy love 


luciana

with words that in an honest suit might move 
first he did praise my beauty  then my speech 


adriana

didst speak him fair 


luciana

have patience  i beseech 


adriana

i cannot  nor i will not  hold me still 
my tongue  though not my heart  shall have his will 
he is deformed  crooked  old and sere 
ill faced  worse bodied  shapeless everywhere 
vicious  ungentle  foolish  blunt  unkind 
stigmatical in making  worse in mind 


luciana

who would be jealous then of such a one 
no evil lost is wail when it is gone 


adriana

ah  but i think him better than i say 
and yet would herein others  eyes were worse 
far from her nest the lapwing cries away 
my heart prays for him  though my tongue do curse 
enter dromio of syracuse


dromio of syracuse

here  go  the desk  the purse  sweet  now  make haste 


luciana

how hast thou lost thy breath 


dromio of syracuse

by running fast 


adriana

where is thy master  dromio  is he well 


dromio of syracuse

no  he in tartar limbo  worse than hell 
a devil in an everlasting garment hath him 
one whose hard heart is button up with steel 
a fiend  a fury  pitiless and rough 
a wolf  nay  worse  a fellow all in buff 
a back friend  a shoulder clapper  one that
countermands
the passages of alleys  creeks and narrow lands 
a hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well 
one that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell 


adriana

why  man  what is the matter 


dromio of syracuse

i do not know the matter  he is  on the case 


adriana

what  is he arrested  tell me at whose suit 


dromio of syracuse

i know not at whose suit he is arrested well 
but he in a suit of buff which  him  that can i tell 
will you send him  mistress  redemption  the money in his desk 


adriana

go fetch it  sister 
exit luciana
this i wonder at 
that he  unknown to me  should be in debt 
tell me  was he arrested on a band 


dromio of syracuse

not on a band  but on a stronger thing 
a chain  a chain  do you not hear it ring 


adriana

what  the chain 


dromio of syracuse

no  no  the bell   time that i were gone 
it was two ere i left him  and now the clock
strikes one 


adriana

the hours come back  that did i never hear 


dromio of syracuse

o  yes  if any hour meet a sergeant  a  turns back for
very fear 


adriana

as if time were in debt  how fondly dost thou reason 


dromio of syracuse

time is a very bankrupt  and owes more than he 
worth  to season 
nay  he a thief too  have you not heard men say
that time comes stealing on by night and day 
if time be in debt and theft  and a sergeant in the way 
hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day 
re enter luciana with a purse


adriana

go  dromio  there the money  bear it straight 
and bring thy master home immediately 
come  sister  i am press down with conceit 
conceit  my comfort and my injury 
exeunt
