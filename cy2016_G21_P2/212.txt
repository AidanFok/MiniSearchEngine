there not a man i meet but doth salute me
as if i were their well acquainted friend 
and every one doth call me by my name 
some tender money to me  some invite me 
some other give me thanks for kindnesses 
some offer me commodities to buy 
even now a tailor call me in his shop
and show me silks that he had bought for me 
and therewithal took measure of my body 
sure  these are but imaginary wiles
and lapland sorcerers inhabit here

dromio of syracuse

not that adam that kept the paradise but that adam
that keeps the prison  he that goes in the calf 
skin that was killed for the prodigal  he that came
behind you  sir  like an evil angel  and bid you
forsake your liberty 
antipholus

bass viol  in a case of leather  the man  sir 
that  when gentlemen are tired  gives them a sob
and  them  he  sir  that takes pity on decayed
men and gives them suits of durance  he that sets up
his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
morris pike 
antipholus


of syracuse

what  thou meanest an officer 


dromio of syracuse

ay  sir  the sergeant of the band  he that brings
any man to answer it that breaks his band  one that
thinks a man always going to bed  and says   
give you good rest 
antipholus


of syracuse

well  sir  there rest in your foolery  is there any


dromio of syracuse

why  sir  i brought you word an hour since that the
bark expedition put forth to night  and then were
you hindered by the sergeant  to tarry for the hoy
delay  here are the angels that you sent for to
deliver you 
antipholus


of syracuse

the fellow is distract  and so am i 
and here we wander in illusions 
some blessed power deliver us from hence 
enter a courtezan

dromio of syracuse

master  is this mistress satan 
antipholus


of syracuse

it is the devil 


dromio of syracuse

nay  she is worse  she is the devil dam  and here
she comes in the habit of a light wench  and thereof
comes that the wenches say  damn me  that as
much to say  make me a light wench  it is
written  they appear to men like angels of light 
light is an effect of fire  and fire will burn 
ergo  light wenches will burn  come not near her 


courtezan

your man and you are marvellous merry  sir 
will you go with me  we mend our dinner here 


dromio of syracuse

master  if you do  expect spoon meat  or bespeak a
long spoon 
antipholus


of syracuse

why  dromio 


dromio of syracuse

marry  he must have a long spoon that must eat with
the devil 
antipholus


of syracuse

avoid then  fiend  what tell thou me of supping 
thou art  as you are all  a sorceress 
i conjure thee to leave me and be gone 


courtezan

give me the ring of mine you had at dinner 
or  for my diamond  the chain you promised 
and i be gone  sir  and not trouble you 


dromio of syracuse

some devils ask but the parings of one nail 
a rush  a hair  a drop of blood  a pin 
a nut  a cherry stone 
but she  more covetous  would have a chain 
master  be wise  an if you give it her 
the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it 


courtezan

i pray you  sir  my ring  or else the chain 
i hope you do not mean to cheat me so 
antipholus


of syracuse

avaunt  thou witch  come  dromio  let us go 


dromio of syracuse

 pride  says the peacock  mistress  that you know 
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse


courtezan

now  out of doubt antipholus is mad 
else would he never so demean himself 
a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats 
and for the same he promised me a chain 
both one and other he denies me now 
the reason that i gather he is mad 
besides this present instance of his rage 
is a mad tale he told to day at dinner 
of his own doors being shut against his entrance 
belike his wife  acquainted with his fits 
on purpose shut the doors against his way 
my way is now to hie home to his house 
and tell his wife that  being lunatic 
he rush into my house and took perforce
my ring away  this course i fittest choose 
for forty ducats is too much to lose 
exit
