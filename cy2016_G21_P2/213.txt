antipholus


of ephesus

thou whoreson  senseless villain 


dromio of ephesus

i would i were senseless  sir  that i might not feel
your blows 


antipholus

thou art sensible in nothing but blows  and so is an
ass 


dromio of ephesus

i am an ass  indeed  you may prove it by my long
ears  i have served him from the hour of my
nativity to this instant  and have nothing at his
hands for my service but blows  when i am cold  he
heats me with beating  when i am warm  he cools me
with beating  i am waked with it when i sleep 
raised with it when i sit  driven out of doors with
it when i go from home  welcomed home with it when
i return  nay  i bear it on my shoulders  as a
beggar wont her brat  and  i think when he hath
lamed me  i shall beg with it from door to door 
antipholus


of ephesus

come  go along  my wife is coming yonder

rather  the prophecy like the parrot   the
rope s end 
antipholus


of ephesus

wilt thou still talk 
beating him


courtezan

how say you now  is not your husband mad 


adriana

his incivility confirms no less 
good doctor pinch  you are a conjurer 
establish him in his true sense again 
and i will please you what you will demand 


luciana

alas  how fiery and how sharp he looks 


courtezan

mark how he trembles in his ecstasy 


pinch

give me your hand and let me feel your pulse 
antipholus


of ephesus

there is my hand  and let it feel your ear 
striking him


pinch

i charge thee  satan  housed within this man 
to yield possession to my holy prayers
and to thy state of darkness hie thee straight 
i conjure thee by all the saints in heaven 
antipholus


of ephesus

peace  doting wizard  peace  i am not mad 


adriana

o  that thou wert not  poor distressed soul 
antipholus


of ephesus

you minion  you  are these your customers 
did this companion with the saffron face
revel and feast it at my house to day 
whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
and i denied to enter in my house 


adriana

o husband  god doth know you dined at home 
where would you had remain until this time 
free from these slanders and this open shame 
antipholus


of ephesus

dined at home  thou villain  what sayest thou 


dromio of ephesus

sir  sooth to say  you did not dine at home 
antipholus


of ephesus

were not my doors lock up and i shut out 


dromio of ephesus

perdie  your doors were lock and you shut out 
antipholus


of ephesus

and did not she herself revile me there 


dromio of ephesus

sans fable  she herself reviled you there 
antipholus


of ephesus

did not her kitchen maid rail  taunt  and scorn me 


dromio of ephesus

certes  she did  the kitchen vestal scorn you 
antipholus


of ephesus

and did not i in rage depart from thence 


dromio of ephesus

in verity you did  my bones bear witness 
that since have felt the vigour of his rage 


adriana

is good to soothe him in these contraries 


pinch

it is no shame  the fellow finds his vein 
and yielding to him humours well his frenzy 
antipholus


of ephesus

thou hast suborn the goldsmith to arrest me 


adriana

alas  i sent you money to redeem you 
by dromio here  who came in haste for it 


dromio of ephesus

money by me  heart and goodwill you might 
but surely master  not a rag of money 
antipholus


of ephesus

went not thou to her for a purse of ducats 


adriana

he came to me and i deliver it 


luciana

and i am witness with her that she did 


dromio of ephesus

god and the rope maker bear me witness
that i was sent for nothing but a rope 


pinch

mistress  both man and master is possess d 
i know it by their pale and deadly looks 
they must be bound and laid in some dark room 
antipholus


of ephesus

say  wherefore didst thou lock me forth to day 
and why dost thou deny the bag of gold 


adriana

i did not  gentle husband  lock thee forth 


dromio of ephesus

and  gentle master  i received no gold 
but i confess  sir  that we were lock out 


adriana

dissembling villain  thou speak false in both 
antipholus


of ephesus

dissembling harlot  thou art false in all 
and art confederate with a damned pack
to make a loathsome abject scorn of me 
but with these nails i pluck out these false eyes
that would behold in me this shameful sport 
enter three or four  and offer to bind him  he strives


adriana

o  bind him  bind him  let him not come near me 


pinch

more company  the fiend is strong within him 


luciana

ay me  poor man  how pale and wan he looks 
antipholus


of ephesus

what  will you murder me  thou gaoler  thou 
i am thy prisoner  wilt thou suffer them
to make a rescue 


officer

                  masters  let him go
he is my prisoner  and you shall not have him 


pinch

go bind this man  for he is frantic too 
they offer to bind dromio of ephesus


adriana

what wilt thou do  thou peevish officer 
hast thou delight to see a wretched man
do outrage and displeasure to himself 


officer

he is my prisoner  if i let him go 
the debt he owes will be required of me 


adriana

i will discharge thee ere i go from thee 
bear me forthwith unto his creditor 
and  knowing how the debt grows  i will pay it 
good master doctor  see him safe convey 
home to my house  o most unhappy day 
antipholus


of ephesus

o most unhappy strumpet 


dromio of ephesus

the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
me  i could find in my heart to stay here still and
turn witch 
antipholus


of syracuse

i will not stay to night for all the town 
therefore away  to get our stuff aboard
