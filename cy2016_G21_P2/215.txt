scene i  rome  a street 


enter a company of mutinous citizens  with staves  clubs  and other weapons


first citizen

before we proceed any further  hear me speak 


all

speak  speak 


first citizen

you are all resolved rather to die than to famish 


all

resolved  resolved 


first citizen

first  you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people 


all

we know t  we know t 


first citizen

let us kill him  and we have corn at our own price 
is a verdict 


all

no more talking on t  let it be done  away  away 


second citizen

one word  good citizens 


first citizen

we are accounted poor citizens  the patricians good 
what authority surfeits on would relieve us  if they
would yield us but the superfluity  while it were
wholesome  we might guess they relieved us humanely 
but they think we are too dear  the leanness that
afflicts us  the object of our misery  is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance  our
sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with
our pikes  ere we become rakes  for the gods know i
speak this in hunger for bread  not in thirst for revenge 


second citizen

would you proceed especially against caius marcius 


all

against him first  he a very dog to the commonalty 


second citizen

consider you what services he has done for his country 


first citizen

very well  and could be content to give him good
report fort  but that he pays himself with being proud 


second citizen

nay  but speak not maliciously 


first citizen

i say unto you  what he hath done famously  he did
it to that end  though soft conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud  which he
is  even till the altitude of his virtue 


second citizen

what he cannot help in his nature  you account a
vice in him  you must in no way say he is covetous 


first citizen

if i must not  i need not be barren of accusations 
he hath faults  with surplus  to tire in repetition 
shouts within
what shouts are these  the other side o  the city
is risen  why stay we prating here  to the capitol 


all

come  come 


first citizen

soft  who comes here 
enter menenius agrippa


second citizen

worthy menenius agrippa  one that hath always loved
the people 


first citizen

he one honest enough  would all the rest were so 


menenius

what work s  my countrymen  in hand  where go you
with bats and clubs  the matter  speak  i pray you 


first citizen

our business is not unknown to the senate  they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do 
which now we show  in deeds  they say poor
suitors have strong breaths  they shall know we
have strong arms too 


menenius

why  masters  my good friends  mine honest neighbours 
will you undo yourselves 


first citizen

we cannot  sir  we are undone already 


menenius

i tell you  friends  most charitable care
have the patricians of you  for your wants 
your suffering in this dearth  you may as well
strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
against the roman state  whose course will on
the way it takes  cracking ten thousand curbs
of more strong link asunder than can ever
appear in your impediment  for the dearth 
the gods  not the patricians  make it  and
your knees to them  not arms  must help  alack 
you are transported by calamity
thither where more attends you  and you slander
the helms o  the state  who care for you like fathers 
when you curse them as enemies 


first citizen

care for us  true  indeed  they ne cared for us
yet  suffer us to famish  and their store houses
crammed with grain  make edicts for usury  to
support usurers  repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich  and provide more
piercing statutes daily  to chain up and restrain
the poor  if the wars eat us not up  they will  and
there all the love they bear us 


menenius

either you must
confess yourselves wondrous malicious 
or be accused of folly  i shall tell you
a pretty tale  it may be you have heard it 
but  since it serves my purpose  i will venture
to stale  a little more 


first citizen

well  i hear it  sir  yet you must not think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale  but  an  please
you  deliver 


menenius

there was a time when all the body members
rebell against the belly  thus accused it 
that only like a gulf it did remain
i  the midst o  the body  idle and unactive 
still cupboarding the viand  never bearing
like labour with the rest  where the other instruments
did see and hear  devise  instruct  walk  feel 
and  mutually participate  did minister
unto the appetite and affection common
of the whole body  the belly answer d 


first citizen

well  sir  what answer made the belly 


menenius

sir  i shall tell you  with a kind of smile 
which ne came from the lungs  but even thus 
for  look you  i may make the belly smile
as well as speak it tauntingly replied
to the discontented members  the mutinous parts
that envied his receipt  even so most fitly
as you malign our senators for that
they are not such as you 


first citizen

your belly answer  what 
the kingly crowned head  the vigilant eye 
the counsellor heart  the arm our soldier 
our steed the leg  the tongue our trumpeter 
with other muniments and petty helps
in this our fabric  if that they 


menenius

what then 
 me  this fellow speaks  what then  what then 


first citizen

should by the cormorant belly be restrain d 
who is the sink o  the body 


menenius

well  what then 


first citizen

the former agents  if they did complain 
what could the belly answer 


menenius

i will tell you
if you bestow a small of what you have little 
patience awhile  you hear the belly answer 


first citizen

ye long about it 


menenius

note me this  good friend 
your most grave belly was deliberate 
not rash like his accusers  and thus answer d 
 is it  my incorporate friends  quoth he 
 i receive the general food at first 
which you do live upon  and fit it is 
because i am the store house and the shop
of the whole body  but  if you do remember 
i send it through the rivers of your blood 
even to the court  the heart  to the seat o  the brain 
and  through the cranks and offices of man 
the strongest nerves and small inferior veins
from me receive that natural competency
whereby they live  and though that all at once 
you  my good friends this says the belly  mark me 


first citizen

ay  sir  well  well 


menenius

 all at once cannot
see what i do deliver out to each 
yet i can make my audit up  that all
from me do back receive the flour of all 
and leave me but the bran  what say you to t 


first citizen

it was an answer  how apply you this 


menenius

the senators of rome are this good belly 
and you the mutinous members  for examine
their counsels and their cares  digest things rightly
touching the weal o  the common  you shall find
no public benefit which you receive
but it proceeds or comes from them to you
and no way from yourselves  what do you think 
you  the great toe of this assembly 


first citizen

i the great toe  why the great toe 


menenius

for that  being one o  the lowest  basest  poorest 
of this most wise rebellion  thou go foremost 
thou rascal  that art worst in blood to run 
lead first to win some vantage 
but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs 
rome and her rats are at the point of battle 
the one side must have bale 
enter caius marcius
hail  noble marcius 


marcius

thanks  what the matter  you dissentious rogues 
that  rubbing the poor itch of your opinion 
make yourselves scabs 


first citizen

we have ever your good word 


marcius

he that will give good words to thee will flatter
beneath abhorring  what would you have  you curs 
that like nor peace nor war  the one affrights you 
the other makes you proud  he that trusts to you 
where he should find you lions  finds you hares 
where foxes  geese  you are no surer  no 
than is the coal of fire upon the ice 
or hailstone in the sun  your virtue is
to make him worthy whose offence subdues him
and curse that justice did it 
who deserves greatness
deserves your hate  and your affections are
a sick man appetite  who desires most that
which would increase his evil  he that depends
upon your favours swims with fins of lead
and hews down oaks with rushes  hang ye  trust ye 
with every minute you do change a mind 
and call him noble that was now your hate 
him vile that was your garland  what the matter 
that in these several places of the city
you cry against the noble senate  who 
under the gods  keep you in awe  which else
would feed on one another  what their seeking 


menenius

for corn at their own rates  whereof  they say 
the city is well stored 


marcius

hang  em  they say 
they sit by the fire  and presume to know
what done i  the capitol  who like to rise 
who thrives and who declines  side factions
and give out
conjectural marriages  making parties strong
and feebling such as stand not in their liking
below their cobbled shoes  they say there 
grain enough 
would the nobility lay aside their ruth 
and let me use my sword  i make a quarry
with thousands of these quarter slaves  as high
as i could pick my lance 


menenius

nay  these are almost thoroughly persuaded 
for though abundantly they lack discretion 
yet are they passing cowardly  but  i beseech you 
what says the other troop 


marcius

they are dissolved  hang  em 
they said they were an hungry  sigh forth proverbs 
that hunger broke stone walls  that dogs must eat 
that meat was made for mouths  that the gods sent not
corn for the rich men only  with these shreds
they vented their complainings  which being answer d 
and a petition granted them  a strange one 
to break the heart of generosity 
and make bold power look pale they threw their caps
as they would hang them on the horns o  the moon 
shouting their emulation 


menenius

what is granted them 


marcius

five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms 
of their own choice  one junius brutus 
sicinius velutus  and i know not sdeath 
the rabble should have first unroof the city 
ere so prevail with me  it will in time
win upon power and throw forth greater themes
for insurrection arguing 


menenius

this is strange 


marcius

go  get you home  you fragments 
enter a messenger  hastily


messenger

where caius marcius 


marcius

here  what the matter 


messenger

the news is  sir  the volsces are in arms 


marcius

i am glad on  t  then we shall ha  means to vent
our musty superfluity  see  our best elders 
enter cominius  titus lartius  and other senators  junius brutus and sicinius velutus


first senator

marcius   true that you have lately told us 
the volsces are in arms 


marcius

they have a leader 
tullus aufidius  that will put you to  t 
i sin in envying his nobility 
and were i any thing but what i am 
i would wish me only he 


cominius

you have fought together 


marcius

were half to half the world by the ears and he 
upon my party  i revolt to make
only my wars with him  he is a lion
that i am proud to hunt 


first senator

then  worthy marcius 
attend upon cominius to these wars 


cominius

it is your former promise 


marcius

sir  it is 
and i am constant  titus lartius  thou
shalt see me once more strike at tullus  face 
what  art thou stiff  stand out 


titus

no  caius marcius 
i lean upon one crutch and fight with t other 
ere stay behind this business 


menenius

o  true bred 


first senator

your company to the capitol  where  i know 
our greatest friends attend us 


titus

 to cominius                 lead you on 
to marcius
right worthy you priority 


cominius

noble marcius 


first senator

 to the citizens   hence to your homes  be gone 


marcius

nay  let them follow 
the volsces have much corn  take these rats thither
to gnaw their garners  worshipful mutiners 
your valour puts well forth  pray  follow 
citizens steal away  exeunt all but sicinius and brutus


sicinius

was ever man so proud as is this marcius 


brutus

he has no equal 


sicinius

when we were chosen tribunes for the people 


brutus

mark you his lip and eyes 


sicinius

nay  but his taunts 


brutus

being moved  he will not spare to gird the gods 


sicinius

be mock the modest moon 


brutus

the present wars devour him  he is grown
too proud to be so valiant 


sicinius

such a nature 
tickled with good success  disdains the shadow
which he treads on at noon  but i do wonder
his insolence can brook to be commanded
under cominius 


brutus

fame  at the which he aims 
in whom already he well graced  can not
better be held nor more attain than by
a place below the first  for what miscarries
shall be the general fault  though he perform
to the utmost of a man  and giddy censure
will then cry out of marcius  if he
had borne the business 


sicinius

besides  if things go well 
opinion that so sticks on marcius shall
of his demerits rob cominius 


brutus

come 
half all cominius  honours are to marcius 
though marcius earned them not  and all his faults
to marcius shall be honours  though indeed
in aught he merit not 


sicinius

let hence  and hear
how the dispatch is made  and in what fashion 
more than his singularity  he goes
upon this present action 


brutus

lets along
