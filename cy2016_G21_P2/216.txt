i would i were a roman  for i cannot 
being a volsce  be that i am  condition 
what good condition can a treaty find
i  the part that is at mercy  five times  marcius 
i have fought with thee  so often hast thou beat me 
and wouldst do so  i think  should we encounter
as often as we eat  by the elements 
if e again i meet him beard to beard 
he mine  or i am his  mine emulation

learn how  held  and what they are that must
be hostages for rome

how the world goes  that to the pace of it
i may spur on my journey
