scene ii  corioli  the senate house 


enter tullus aufidius and certain senators


first senator

so  your opinion is  aufidius 
that they of rome are entered in our counsels
and know how we proceed 


aufidius

is it not yours 
what ever have been thought on in this state 
that could be brought to bodily act ere rome
had circumvention   not four days gone
since i heard thence  these are the words  i think
i have the letter here  yes  here it is 
reads
 have press a power  but it is not known
whether for east or west  the dearth is great 
the people mutinous  and it is rumour d 
cominius  marcius your old enemy 
who is of rome worse hated than of you 
and titus lartius  a most valiant roman 
these three lead on this preparation
whither  bent  most likely  for you 
consider of it 


first senator

                  our army in the field
we never yet made doubt but rome was ready
to answer us 


aufidius

                  nor did you think it folly
to keep your great pretences veil till when
they needs must show themselves  which
in the hatching 
it seem d  appear to rome  by the discovery 
we shall be shorten in our aim  which was
to take in many towns ere almost rome
should know we were afoot 


second senator

noble aufidius 
take your commission  hie you to your bands 
let us alone to guard corioli 
if they set down before  s  for the remove
bring your army  but  i think  you find
they not prepared for us 


aufidius

o  doubt not that 
i speak from certainties  nay  more 
some parcels of their power are forth already 
and only hitherward  i leave your honours 
if we and caius marcius chance to meet 
 sworn between us we shall ever strike
till one can do no more 


all

the gods assist you 


aufidius

and keep your honours safe 


first senator

farewell 


second senator

farewell 


all

farewell 
exeunt
