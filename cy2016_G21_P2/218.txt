volumnia

i pray you  daughter  sing  or express yourself in a
more comfortable sort  if my son were my husband  i
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love  when yet he was but
tender bodied and the only son of my womb  when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way  when
for a day of kings  entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding  i  considering
how honour would become such a person  that it was
no better than picture like to hang by the wall  if
renown made it not stir  was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame  to a cruel
war i sent him  from whence he returned  his brows
bound with oak  i tell thee  daughter  i sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a man child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man 


virgilia

but had he died in the business  madam  how then 


volumnia

then his good report should have been my son  i
therein would have found issue  hear me profess
sincerely  had i a dozen sons  each in my love
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
marcius  i had rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action 
enter a gentlewoman


gentlewoman

madam  the lady valeria is come to visit you 


virgilia

beseech you  give me leave to retire myself 


volumnia

indeed  you shall not 
methinks i hear hither your husband drum 
see him pluck aufidius down by the hair 
as children from a bear  the volsces shunning him 
methinks i see him stamp thus  and call thus 
 on  you cowards  you were got in fear 
though you were born in rome  his bloody brow
with his mail hand then wiping  forth he goes 
like to a harvest man that task to mow
or all or lose his hire 


virgilia

his bloody brow  o jupiter  no blood 


volumnia

away  you fool  it more becomes a man
than gilt his trophy  the breasts of hecuba 
when she did suckle hector  look not lovelier
than hector forehead when it spit forth blood
at grecian sword  contemning  tell valeria 
we are fit to bid her welcome 
exit gentlewoman


virgilia

heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius 


volumnia

he beat aufidius  below his knee
and tread upon his neck 
enter valeria  with an usher and gentlewoman


valeria

faith  how does your little son 


virgilia

i thank your ladyship  well  good madam 


volumnia

he had rather see the swords  and hear a drum  than
look upon his school master 


valeria

o  my word  the father son  i swear a
very pretty boy  o  my troth  i looked upon him o 
wednesday half an hour together  has such a
confirmed countenance  i saw him run after a gilded
butterfly  and when he caught it  he let it go
again  and after it again  and over and over he
comes  and again  catched it again  or whether his
fall enraged him  or how  twas  he did so set his
teeth and tear it  o  i warrant it  how he mammocked
it 


volumnia

one on  father moods 


valeria

valeria

the yarn she spun in ulysses  absence did but fill
ithaca full of moths  come  i would your cambric
were sensible as your finger  that you might leave
pricking it for pity  come  you shall go with us 


virgilia

down before their city corioli  they nothing doubt
prevailing and to make it brief wars  this is true 
on mine honour  and so  i pray  go with us
