lartius

agreed 


marcius

say  has our general met the enemy 


messenger

they lie in view  but have not spoke as yet 


lartius

so  the good horse is mine 


marcius

i buy him of you 


lartius

no  i nor sell nor give him  lend you him i will
for half a hundred years  summon the town 


marcius

how far off lie these armies 


messenger

within this mile and half 


marcius

then shall we hear their  larum  and they ours 
now  mars  i prithee  make us quick in work 
that we with smoking swords may march from hence 
to help our fielded friends  come  blow thy blast 
they sound a parley  enter two senators with others on the walls
tutus aufidius  is he within your walls 


first senator

no  nor a man that fears you less than he 
that lesser than a little 
drums afar off
hark  our drums
are bringing forth our youth  we break our walls 
rather than they shall pound us up  our gates 
which yet seem shut  we  have but pinn with rushes 
they open of themselves 
alarum afar off
hark you  far off 
there is aufidius  list  what work he makes
amongst your cloven army 


marcius

o  they are at it 


lartius

their noise be our instruction  ladders  ho 
enter the army of the volsces


marcius

they fear us not  but issue forth their city 
now put your shields before your hearts  and fight
with hearts more proof than shields  advance 
brave titus 
they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts 
which makes me sweat with wrath  come on  my fellows 
he that retires i take him for a volsce 
and he shall feel mine edge 
alarum  the romans are beat back to their trenches  re enter marcius cursing


marcius

all the contagion of the south light on you 
you shames of rome  you herd of boils and plagues
plaster you o er  that you may be abhorr 
further than seen and one infect another
against the wind a mile  you souls of geese 
that bear the shapes of men  how have you run
from slaves that apes would beat  pluto and hell 
all hurt behind  backs red  and faces pale
with flight and agued fear  mend and charge home 
or  by the fires of heaven  i leave the foe
and make my wars on you  look to t  come on 
if you stand fast  we beat them to their wives 
as they us to our trenches followed 
another alarum  the volsces fly  and marcius follows them to the gates
so  now the gates are ope  now prove good seconds 
 for the followers fortune widens them 
not for the fliers  mark me  and do the like 
enters the gates


first soldier

fool hardiness  not i 


second soldier

nor i 
marcius is shut in


first soldier

see  they have shut him in 


all

to the pot  i warrant him 
alarum continues
re enter titus lartius


lartius

what is become of marcius 


all

slain  sir  doubtless 


first soldier

following the fliers at the very heels 
with them he enters  who  upon the sudden 
clapp to their gates  he is himself alone 
to answer all the city 


lartius

o noble fellow 
who sensibly outdares his senseless sword 
and  when it bows  stands up  thou art left  marcius 
a carbuncle entire  as big as thou art 
were not so rich a jewel  thou wast a soldier
even to cato wish  not fierce and terrible
only in strokes  but  with thy grim looks and
the thunder like percussion of thy sounds 
thou madst thine enemies shake  as if the world
were feverous and did tremble 
re enter marcius  bleeding  assaulted by the enemy


first soldier

look  sir 


lartius

o marcius 
let fetch him off  or make remain alike 
they fight  and all enter the city
