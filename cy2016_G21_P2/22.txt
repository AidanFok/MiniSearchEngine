scene v  the same 


here an alarum again  and talbot pursueth the  dauphin  and driveth him  then enter joan la  pucelle  driving englishmen before her  and exit after them then re enter talbot


talbot

where is my strength  my valour  and my force 
our english troops retire  i cannot stay them 
a woman clad in armour chaseth them 
re enter joan la pucelle
here  here she comes  i have a bout with thee 
devil or devil dam  i conjure thee 
blood will i draw on thee  thou art a witch 
and straightway give thy soul to him thou servest 


joan la pucelle

come  come   only i that must disgrace thee 
here they fight


talbot

heavens  can you suffer hell so to prevail 
my breast i burst with straining of my courage
and from my shoulders crack my arms asunder 
but i will chastise this high minded strumpet 
they fight again


joan la pucelle

talbot  farewell  thy hour is not yet come 
i must go victual orleans forthwith 
a short alarum  then enter the town with soldiers
o me  if thou canst  i scorn thy strength 
go  go  cheer up thy hungry starved men 
help salisbury to make his testament 
this day is ours  as many more shall be 
exit


talbot

my thoughts are whirled like a potter wheel 
i know not where i am  nor what i do 
a witch  by fear  not force  like hannibal 
drives back our troops and conquers as she lists 
so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
are from their hives and houses driven away 
they call us for our fierceness english dogs 
now  like to whelps  we crying run away 
a short alarum
hark  countrymen  either renew the fight 
or tear the lions out of england coat 
renounce your soil  give sheep in lions  stead 
sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf 
or horse or oxen from the leopard 
as you fly from your oft subdued slaves 
alarum  here another skirmish
it will not be  retire into your trenches 
you all consented unto salisbury death 
for none would strike a stroke in his revenge 
pucelle is enter into orleans 
in spite of us or aught that we could do 
o  would i were to die with salisbury 
the shame hereof will make me hide my head 
exit talbot  alarum  retreat  flourish
