a murrain on t  i took this for silver 
alarum continues still afar off
enter marcius and titus lartius with a trumpet


marcius

see here these movers that do prize their hours
at a crack drachm  cushions  leaden spoons 
irons of a doit  doublets that hangmen would
bury with those that wore them  these base slaves 
ere yet the fight be done  pack up  down with them 
and hark  what noise the general makes  to him 
there is the man of my soul hate  aufidius 
piercing our romans  then  valiant titus  take
convenient numbers to make good the city 
whilst i  with those that have the spirit  will haste
to help cominius 


lartius

                  worthy sir  thou bleed st 
thy exercise hath been too violent for
a second course of fight 


marcius

sir  praise me not 
my work hath yet not warm me  fare you well 
the blood i drop is rather physical
than dangerous to me  to aufidius thus
i will appear  and fight 


lartius

now the fair goddess  fortune 
fall deep in love with thee  and her great charms
misguide thy opposers  swords  bold gentleman 
prosperity be thy page

thy friend no less
than those she placeth highest  so  farewell 


lartius

thou worthiest marcius 
exit marcius
go  sound thy trumpet in the market place 
call thither all the officers o  the town 
where they shall know our mind  away 
exeunt
