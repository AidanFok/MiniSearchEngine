scene vi  near the camp of cominius 


enter cominius  as it were in retire  with soldiers


cominius

breathe you  my friends  well fought 
we are come off
like romans  neither foolish in our stands 
nor cowardly in retire  believe me  sirs 
we shall be charged again  whiles we have struck 
by interims and conveying gusts we have heard
the charges of our friends  ye roman gods 
lead their successes as we wish our own 
that both our powers  with smiling
fronts encountering 
may give you thankful sacrifice 
enter a messenger
thy news 


messenger

the citizens of corioli have issued 
and given to lartius and to marcius battle 
i saw our party to their trenches driven 
and then i came away 


cominius

though thou speak truth 
methinks thou speak not well 
how long is since 


messenger

above an hour  my lord 


cominius

 not a mile  briefly we heard their drums 
how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour 
and bring thy news so late 


messenger

spies of the volsces
held me in chase  that i was forced to wheel
three or four miles about  else had i  sir 
half an hour since brought my report 


cominius

who yonder 
that does appear as he were flay d  o gods
he has the stamp of marcius  and i have
before time seen him thus 


marcius

 within                  come i too late 


cominius

the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
more than i know the sound of marcius  tongue
from every meaner man 
enter marcius


marcius

come i too late 


cominius

ay  if you come not in the blood of others 
but mantled in your own 


marcius

o  let me clip ye
in arms as sound as when i woo d  in heart
as merry as when our nuptial day was done 
and tapers burn to bedward 


cominius

flower of warriors 
how is it with titus lartius 


marcius

as with a man busied about decrees 
condemning some to death  and some to exile 
ransoming him  or pitying  threatening the other 
holding corioli in the name of rome 
even like a fawning greyhound in the leash 
to let him slip at will 


cominius

where is that slave
which told me they had beat you to your trenches 
where is he  call him hither 


marcius

let him alone 
he did inform the truth  but for our gentlemen 
the common file a plague  tribunes for them 
the mouse ne shunn the cat as they did budge
from rascals worse than they 


cominius

but how prevail you 


marcius

will the time serve to tell  i do not think 
where is the enemy  are you lords o  the field 
if not  why cease you till you are so 


cominius

marcius 
we have at disadvantage fought and did
retire to win our purpose 


marcius

how lies their battle  know you on which side
they have placed their men of trust 


cominius

as i guess  marcius 
their bands i  the vaward are the antiates 
of their best trust  o them aufidius 
their very heart of hope 


marcius

i do beseech you 
by all the battles wherein we have fought 
by the blood we have shed together  by the vows
we have made to endure friends  that you directly
set me against aufidius and his antiates 
and that you not delay the present  but 
filling the air with swords advanced and darts 
we prove this very hour 


cominius

though i could wish
you were conducted to a gentle bath
and balms applied to  you  yet dare i never
deny your asking  take your choice of those
that best can aid your action 


marcius

those are they
that most are willing  if any such be here 
as it were sin to doubt that love this painting
wherein you see me smear d  if any fear
lesser his person than an ill report 
if any think brave death outweighs bad life
and that his country dearer than himself 
let him alone  or so many so minded 
wave thus  to express his disposition 
and follow marcius 
they all shout and wave their swords  take him up in their arms  and cast up their caps
o  me alone  make you a sword of me 
if these shows be not outward  which of you
but is four volsces  none of you but is
able to bear against the great aufidius
a shield as hard as his  a certain number 
though thanks to all  must i select
from all  the rest
shall bear the business in some other fight 
as cause will be obey d  please you to march 
and four shall quickly draw out my command 
which men are best inclined 


cominius

march on  my fellows 
make good this ostentation  and you shall
divide in all with us
