scene viii  a field of battle 


alarum as in battle  enter  from opposite sides  marcius and aufidius


marcius

i fight with none but thee  for i do hate thee
worse than a promise breaker 


aufidius

we hate alike 
not afric owns a serpent i abhor
more than thy fame and envy  fix thy foot 


marcius

let the first budger die the other slave 
and the gods doom him after 


aufidius

if i fly  marcius 
holloa me like a hare 


marcius

within these three hours  tullus 
alone i fought in your corioli walls 
and made what work i pleased   not my blood
wherein thou seest me mask d  for thy revenge
wrench up thy power to the highest 


aufidius

wert thou the hector
that was the whip of your bragg progeny 
thou shouldst not scape me here 
they fight  and certain volsces come to the aid of  aufidius  marcius fights till they be driven in breathless
officious  and not valiant  you have shamed me
in your condemned seconds
