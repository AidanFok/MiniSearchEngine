scene ix  the roman camp 


flourish  alarum  a retreat is sounded  flourish   enter  from one side  cominius with the romans  from the other side  marcius  with his arm in a scarf


cominius

if i should tell thee o this thy day work 
thou not believe thy deeds  but i report it
where senators shall mingle tears with smiles 
where great patricians shall attend and shrug 
i  the end admire  where ladies shall be frighted 
and  gladly quaked  hear more  where the
dull tribunes 
that  with the fusty plebeians  hate thine honours 
shall say against their hearts  thank the gods
our rome hath such a soldier 
yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast 
having fully dined before 
enter titus lartius  with his power  from the pursuit


lartius

o general 
here is the steed  we the caparison 
hadst thou beheld 


marcius

pray now  no more  my mother 
who has a charter to extol her blood 
when she does praise me grieves me  i have done
as you have done  that what i can  induced
as you have been  that for my country 
he that has but effected his good will
hath overta mine act 


cominius

you shall not be
the grave of your deserving  rome must know
the value of her own   a concealment
worse than a theft  no less than a traducement 
to hide your doings  and to silence that 
which  to the spire and top of praises vouch d 
would seem but modest  therefore  i beseech you
in sign of what you are  not to reward
what you have done before our army hear me 


marcius

i have some wounds upon me  and they smart
to hear themselves remember d 


cominius

should they not 
well might they fester  ingratitude 
and tent themselves with death  of all the horses 
whereof we have ta good and good store  of all
the treasure in this field achieved and city 
we render you the tenth  to be ta forth 
before the common distribution  at
your only choice 


marcius

                  i thank you  general 
but cannot make my heart consent to take
a bribe to pay my sword  i do refuse it 
and stand upon my common part with those
that have beheld the doing 
a long flourish  they all cry  marcius  marcius   cast up their caps and lances  cominius and lartius stand bare


marcius

may these same instruments  which you profane 
never sound more  when drums and trumpets shall
i  the field prove flatterers  let courts and cities be
made all of false faced soothing 
when steel grows soft as the parasite silk 
let him be made a coverture for the wars 
no more  i say  for that i have not wash 
my nose that bled  or foil some debile wretch 
which  without note  here many else have done 
you shout me forth
in acclamations hyperbolical 
as if i loved my little should be dieted
in praises sauced with lies 


cominius

too modest are you 
more cruel to your good report than grateful
to us that give you truly  by your patience 
if  yourself you be incensed  we put you 
like one that means his proper harm  in manacles 
then reason safely with you  therefore  be it known 
as to us  to all the world  that caius marcius
wears this war garland  in token of the which 
my noble steed  known to the camp  i give him 
with all his trim belonging  and from this time 
for what he did before corioli  call him 
with all the applause and clamour of the host 
caius marcius coriolanus  bear
the addition nobly ever 
flourish  trumpets sound  and drums


all

caius marcius coriolanus 


coriolanus

i will go wash 
and when my face is fair  you shall perceive
whether i blush or no  howbeit  i thank you 
i mean to stride your steed  and at all times
to undercrest your good addition
to the fairness of my power 


cominius

so  to our tent 
where  ere we do repose us  we will write
to rome of our success  you  titus lartius 
must to corioli back  send us to rome
the best  with whom we may articulate 
for their own good and ours 


lartius

i shall  my lord 


coriolanus

the gods begin to mock me  i  that now
refused most princely gifts  am bound to beg
of my lord general 


cominius

take t   yours  what is t 


coriolanus

i sometime lay here in corioli
at a poor man house  he used me kindly 
he cried to me  i saw him prisoner 
but then aufidius was with in my view 
and wrath o erwhelm my pity  i request you
to give my poor host freedom 


cominius

o  well begg d 
were he the butcher of my son  he should
be free as is the wind  deliver him  titus 


lartius

marcius  his name 


coriolanus

                  by jupiter  forgot 
i am weary  yea  my memory is tired 
have we no wine here 


cominius

go we to our tent 
the blood upon your visage dries   time
it should be look to  come 
exeunt
