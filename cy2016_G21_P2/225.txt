scene i  rome  a public place 


enter menenius with the two tribunes of the people  sicinius and brutus 


menenius

the augurer tells me we shall have news to night 


brutus

good or bad 


menenius

not according to the prayer of the people  for they
love not marcius 


sicinius

nature teaches beasts to know their friends 


menenius

pray you  who does the wolf love 


sicinius

the lamb 


menenius

ay  to devour him  as the hungry plebeians would the
noble marcius 


brutus

he a lamb indeed  that baes like a bear 


menenius

he a bear indeed  that lives like a lamb  you two
are old men  tell me one thing that i shall ask you 


both

well  sir 


menenius

in what enormity is marcius poor in  that you two
have not in abundance 


brutus

he poor in no one fault  but stored with all 


sicinius

especially in pride 


brutus

and topping all others in boasting 


menenius

this is strange now  do you two know how you are
censured here in the city  i mean of us o  the
right hand file  do you 


both

why  how are we censured 


menenius

because you talk of pride now will you not be angry 


both

well  well  sir  well 


menenius

why   no great matter  for a very little thief of
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience 
give your dispositions the reins  and be angry at
your pleasures  at the least if you take it as a
pleasure to you in being so  you blame marcius for
being proud 


brutus

we do it not alone  sir 


menenius

i know you can do very little alone  for your helps
are many  or else your actions would grow wondrous
single  your abilities are too infant like for
doing much alone  you talk of pride  o that you
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks 
and make but an interior survey of your good selves 
o that you could 


brutus

what then  sir 


menenius

why  then you should discover a brace of unmeriting 
proud  violent  testy magistrates  alias fools  as
any in rome 


sicinius

menenius  you are known well enough too 


menenius

i am known to be a humorous patrician  and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
tiber in t  said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint  hasty and tinder like
upon too trivial motion  one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
of the morning  what i think i utter  and spend my
malice in my breath  meeting two such wealsmen as
you are i cannot call you lycurguses if the drink
you give me touch my palate adversely  i make a
crooked face at it  i can say your worships have
delivered the matter well  when i find the ass in
compound with the major part of your syllables  and
though i must be content to bear with those that say
you are reverend grave men  yet they lie deadly that
tell you you have good faces  if you see this in
the map of my microcosm  follows it that i am known
well enough too  what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character  if i be
known well enough too 


brutus

come  sir  come  we know you well enough 


menenius

you know neither me  yourselves nor any thing  you
are ambitious for poor knaves  caps and legs  you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fosset seller 
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience  when you are hearing a
matter between party and party  if you chance to be
pinched with the colic  you make faces like
mummers  set up the bloody flag against all
patience  and  in roaring for a chamber pot 
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing  all the peace you make in their
cause is  calling both the parties knaves  you are
a pair of strange ones 


brutus

come  come  you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the capitol 


menenius

our very priests must become mockers  if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are  when
you speak best unto the purpose  it is not worth the
wagging of your beards  and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher 
cushion  or to be entombed in an ass pack 
saddle  yet you must be saying  marcius is proud 
who in a cheap estimation  is worth predecessors
since deucalion  though peradventure some of the
best of  were hereditary hangmen  god den to
your worships  more of your conversation would
infect my brain  being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians  i will be bold to take my leave of you 
brutus and sicinius go aside
enter volumnia  virgilia  and valeria
how now  my as fair as noble ladies and the moon 
were she earthly  no nobler whither do you follow
your eyes so fast 


volumnia

honourable menenius  my boy marcius approaches  for
the love of juno  let go 


menenius

ha  marcius coming home 


volumnia

ay  worthy menenius  and with most prosperous
approbation 


menenius

take my cap  jupiter  and i thank thee  hoo 
marcius coming home 


volumnia

virgilia

nay true 


volumnia

look  here a letter from him  the state hath
another  his wife another  and  i think  there one
at home for you 


menenius

i will make my very house reel tonight  a letter for
me 


virgilia

yes  certain  there a letter for you  i saw t 


menenius

a letter for me  it gives me an estate of seven
years  health  in which time i will make a lip at
the physician  the most sovereign prescription in
galen is but empiricutic  and  to this preservative 
of no better report than a horse drench  is he
not wounded  he was wont to come home wounded 


virgilia

o  no  no  no 


volumnia

o  he is wounded  i thank the gods for t 


menenius

so do i too  if it be not too much  brings a 
victory in his pocket  the wounds become him 


volumnia

on brows  menenius  he comes the third time home
with the oaken garland 


menenius

has he disciplined aufidius soundly 


volumnia

titus lartius writes  they fought together  but
aufidius got off 


menenius

and  time for him too  i warrant him that 
an he had stayed by him  i would not have been so
fidiused for all the chests in corioli  and the gold
that in them  is the senate possessed of this 


volumnia

good ladies  let go  yes  yes  yes  the senate
has letters from the general  wherein he gives my
son the whole name of the war  he hath in this
action outdone his former deeds doubly


valeria

in troth  there wondrous things spoke of him 


menenius

wondrous  ay  i warrant you  and not without his
true purchasing 


virgilia

the gods grant them true 


volumnia

true  pow  wow 


menenius

true  i be sworn they are true 
where is he wounded 
to the tribunes
god save your good worships  marcius is coming
home  he has more cause to be proud  where is he wounded 


volumnia

i  the shoulder and i  the left arm there will be
large cicatrices to show the people  when he shall
stand for his place  he received in the repulse of
tarquin seven hurts i  the body 


menenius

one i  the neck  and two i  the thigh there 
nine that i know 


volumnia

he had  before this last expedition  twenty five
wounds upon him 


menenius

now it twenty seven  every gash was an enemy grave 
a shout and flourish
hark  the trumpets 


volumnia

these are the ushers of marcius  before him he
carries noise  and behind him he leaves tears 
death  that dark spirit  in  nervy arm doth lie 
which  being advanced  declines  and then men die 
a sennet  trumpets sound  enter cominius the  general  and titus lartius  between them  coriolanus   crowned with an oaken garland  with captains and soldiers  and a herald


herald

know  rome  that all alone marcius did fight
within corioli gates  where he hath won 
with fame  a name to caius marcius  these
in honour follows coriolanus 
welcome to rome  renowned coriolanus 
flourish


all

welcome to rome  renowned coriolanus 


coriolanus

no more of this  it does offend my heart 
pray now  no more 


cominius

                  look  sir  your mother 


coriolanus

o 
you have  i know  petition all the gods
for my prosperity 
kneels


volumnia

                  nay  my good soldier  up 
my gentle marcius  worthy caius  and
by deed achieving honour newly named 
what is it coriolanus must i call thee 
but o  thy wife 


coriolanus

                  my gracious silence  hail 
wouldst thou have laugh had i come coffin home 
that weep to see me triumph  ay  my dear 
such eyes the widows in corioli wear 
and mothers that lack sons 


menenius

now  the gods crown thee 


coriolanus

and live you yet 
to valeria
o my sweet lady  pardon 


volumnia

i know not where to turn  o  welcome home 
and welcome  general  and ye welcome all 


menenius

a hundred thousand welcomes  i could weep
and i could laugh  i am light and heavy  welcome 
a curse begin at very root on heart 
that is not glad to see thee  you are three
that rome should dote on  yet  by the faith of men 
we have some old crab trees here
at home that will not
be grafted to your relish  yet welcome  warriors 
we call a nettle but a nettle and
the faults of fools but folly 


cominius

ever right 


coriolanus

menenius ever  ever 


herald

give way there  and go on 


coriolanus

 to volumnia and virgilia   your hand  and yours 
ere in our own house i do shade my head 
the good patricians must be visited 
from whom i have received not only greetings 
but with them change of honours 


volumnia

i have lived
to see inherited my very wishes
and the buildings of my fancy  only
there one thing wanting  which i doubt not but
our rome will cast upon thee 


coriolanus

know  good mother 
i had rather be their servant in my way 
than sway with them in theirs 


cominius

on  to the capitol 
flourish  cornets  exeunt in state  as before  brutus and sicinius come forward


brutus

all tongues speak of him  and the bleared sights
are spectacled to see him  your prattling nurse
into a rapture lets her baby cry
while she chats him  the kitchen malkin pins
her richest lockram  her reechy neck 
clambering the walls to eye him  stalls  bulks  windows 
are smother up  leads fill d  and ridges horsed
with variable complexions  all agreeing
in earnestness to see him  seld shown flamens
do press among the popular throngs and puff
to win a vulgar station  or veil dames
commit the war of white and damask in
their nicely gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
of phoebus  burning kisses  such a pother
as if that whatsoever god who leads him
were slily crept into his human powers
and gave him graceful posture 


sicinius

on the sudden 
i warrant him consul 


brutus

then our office may 
during his power  go sleep 


sicinius

he cannot temperately transport his honours
from where he should begin and end  but will
lose those he hath won 


brutus

in that there comfort 


sicinius

doubt not
the commoners  for whom we stand  but they
upon their ancient malice will forget
with the least cause these his new honours  which
that he will give them make i as little question
as he is proud to do t 


brutus

i heard him swear 
were he to stand for consul  never would he
appear i  the market place nor on him put
the napless vesture of humility 
nor showing  as the manner is  his wounds
to the people  beg their stinking breaths 


sicinius

 right 


brutus

it was his word  o  he would miss it rather
than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him 
and the desire of the nobles 


sicinius

i wish no better
than have him hold that purpose and to put it
in execution 


brutus

 most like he will 


sicinius

it shall be to him then as our good wills 
a sure destruction 


brutus

so it must fall out
to him or our authorities  for an end 
we must suggest the people in what hatred
he still hath held them  that to power he would
have made them mules  silenced their pleaders and
dispropertied their freedoms  holding them 
in human action and capacity 
of no more soul nor fitness for the world
than camels in the war  who have their provand
only for bearing burdens  and sore blows
for sinking under them 


sicinius

this  as you say  suggested
at some time when his soaring insolence
shall touch the people which time shall not want 
if he be put upon  t  and that as easy
as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire
to kindle their dry stubble  and their blaze
shall darken him for ever 
enter a messenger


brutus

what the matter 


messenger

you are sent for to the capitol   thought
that marcius shall be consul 
i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
the blind to bear him speak  matrons flung gloves 
ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers 
upon him as he pass d  the nobles bended 
as to jove statue  and the commons made
a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts 
i never saw the like 


brutus

let to the capitol 
and carry with us ears and eyes for the time 
but hearts for the event 


sicinius

have with you 
exeunt
