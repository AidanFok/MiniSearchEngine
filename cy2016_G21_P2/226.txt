scene ii  the same  the capitol 


enter two officers  to lay cushions


first officer

come  come  they are almost here  how many stand
for consulships 


second officer

three  they say  but  thought of every one
coriolanus will carry it 


first officer

that a brave fellow  but he vengeance proud  and
loves not the common people 


second officer

faith  there had been many great men that have
flattered the people  who ne loved them  and there
be many that they have loved  they know not
wherefore  so that  if they love they know not why 
they hate upon no better a ground  therefore  for
coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition  and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly see t 


first officer

if he did not care whether he had their love or no 
he waved indifferently  doing them neither
good nor harm  but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him  and leaves
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite  now  to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
dislikes  to flatter them for their love 


second officer

he hath deserved worthily of his country  and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who 
having been supple and courteous to the people 
bonneted  without any further deed to have them at
an into their estimation and report  but he hath so
planted his honours in their eyes  and his actions
in their hearts  that for their tongues to be
silent  and not confess so much  were a kind of
ingrateful injury  to report otherwise  were a
malice  that  giving itself the lie  would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it 


first officer

no more of him  he is a worthy man  make way  they
are coming 
a sennet  enter  with actors before them  cominius  the consul  menenius  coriolanus  senators   sicinius and brutus  the senators take their  places  the tribunes take their places by themselves  coriolanus stands


menenius

having determined of the volsces and
to send for titus lartius  it remains 
as the main point of this our after meeting 
to gratify his noble service that
hath thus stood for his country  therefore 
please you 
most reverend and grave elders  to desire
the present consul  and last general
in our well found successes  to report
a little of that worthy work perform 
by caius marcius coriolanus  whom
we met here both to thank and to remember
with honours like himself 


first senator

speak  good cominius 
leave nothing out for length  and make us think
rather our state defective for requital
than we to stretch it out 
to the tribunes
masters o  the people 
we do request your kindest ears  and after 
your loving motion toward the common body 
to yield what passes here 


sicinius

we are convented
upon a pleasing treaty  and have hearts
inclinable to honour and advance
the theme of our assembly 


brutus

which the rather
we shall be blest to do  if he remember
a kinder value of the people than
he hath hereto prized them at 


menenius

that off  that off 
i would you rather had been silent  please you
to hear cominius speak 


brutus

most willingly 
but yet my caution was more pertinent
than the rebuke you give it 


menenius

he loves your people
but tie him not to be their bedfellow 
worthy cominius  speak 
coriolanus offers to go away
nay  keep your place 


first senator

sit  coriolanus  never shame to hear
what you have nobly done 


coriolanus

your horror pardon 
i had rather have my wounds to heal again
than hear say how i got them 


brutus

sir  i hope
my words disbench you not 


coriolanus

no  sir  yet oft 
when blows have made me stay  i fled from words 
you soothed not  therefore hurt not  but
your people 
i love them as they weigh 


menenius

pray now  sit down 


coriolanus

i had rather have one scratch my head i  the sun
when the alarum were struck than idly sit
to hear my nothings monster d 
exit


menenius

masters of the people 
your multiplying spawn how can he flatter 
that thousand to one good one when you now see
he had rather venture all his limbs for honour
than one on ears to hear it  proceed  cominius 


cominius

i shall lack voice  the deeds of coriolanus
should not be utter feebly  it is held
that valour is the chiefest virtue  and
most dignifies the haver  if it be 
the man i speak of cannot in the world
be singly counterpoised  at sixteen years 
when tarquin made a head for rome  he fought
beyond the mark of others  our then dictator 
whom with all praise i point at  saw him fight 
when with his amazonian chin he drove
the bristled lips before him  be bestrid
an o er press roman and i  the consul view
slew three opposers  tarquin self he met 
and struck him on his knee  in that day feats 
when he might act the woman in the scene 
he proved best man i  the field  and for his meed
was brow bound with the oak  his pupil age
man enter thus  he waxed like a sea 
and in the brunt of seventeen battles since
he lurch all swords of the garland  for this last 
before and in corioli  let me say 
i cannot speak him home  he stopp the fliers 
and by his rare example made the coward
turn terror into sport  as weeds before
a vessel under sail  so men obey 
and fell below his stem  his sword  death stamp 
where it did mark  it took  from face to foot
he was a thing of blood  whose every motion
was timed with dying cries  alone he enter 
the mortal gate of the city  which he painted
with shunless destiny  aidless came off 
and with a sudden reinforcement struck
corioli like a planet  now all his 
when  by and by  the din of war gan pierce
his ready sense  then straight his doubled spirit
re quicken what in flesh was fatigate 
and to the battle came he  where he did
run reeking o the lives of men  as if
 a perpetual spoil  and till we call 
both field and city ours  he never stood
to ease his breast with panting 


menenius

worthy man 


first senator

he cannot but with measure fit the honours
which we devise him 


cominius

our spoils he kick at 
and look upon things precious as they were
the common muck of the world  he covets less
than misery itself would give  rewards
his deeds with doing them  and is content
to spend the time to end it 


menenius

he right noble 
let him be call for 


first senator

call coriolanus 


officer

he doth appear 
re enter coriolanus


menenius

the senate  coriolanus  are well pleased
to make thee consul 


coriolanus

i do owe them still
my life and services 


menenius

it then remains
that you do speak to the people 


coriolanus

i do beseech you 
let me o that custom  for i cannot
put on the gown  stand naked and entreat them 
for my wounds  sake  to give their suffrage  please you
that i may pass this doing 


sicinius

sir  the people
must have their voices  neither will they bate
one jot of ceremony 


menenius

put them not to t 
pray you  go fit you to the custom and
take to you  as your predecessors have 
your honour with your form 


coriolanus

it is apart
that i shall blush in acting  and might well
be taken from the people 


brutus

mark you that 


coriolanus

to brag unto them  thus i did  and thus 
show them the unaching scars which i should hide 
as if i had received them for the hire
of their breath only 


menenius

do not stand upon t 
we recommend to you  tribunes of the people 
our purpose to them  and to our noble consul
wish we all joy and honour 


senators

to coriolanus come all joy and honour 
flourish of cornets  exeunt all but sicinius and brutus


brutus

you see how he intends to use the people 


sicinius

may they perceive intent  he will require them 
as if he did contemn what he requested
should be in them to give 


brutus

come  we inform them
of our proceedings here  on the marketplace 
i know  they do attend us 
exeunt
