scene iii  the same  the forum 


enter seven or eight citizens


first citizen

once  if he do require our voices  we ought not to deny him 


second citizen

we may  sir  if we will 


third citizen

we have power in ourselves to do it  but it is a
power that we have no power to do  for if he show us
his wounds and tell us his deeds  we are to put our
tongues into those wounds and speak for them  so  if
he tell us his noble deeds  we must also tell him
our noble acceptance of them  ingratitude is
monstrous  and for the multitude to be ingrateful 
were to make a monster of the multitude  of the
which we being members  should bring ourselves to be
monstrous members 


first citizen

and to make us no better thought of  a little help
will serve  for once we stood up about the corn  he
himself stuck not to call us the many headed multitude 


third citizen

we have been called so of many  not that our heads
are some brown  some black  some auburn  some bald 
but that our wits are so diversely coloured  and
truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull  they would fly east  west  north  south 
and their consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the points o  the compass 


second citizen

think you so  which way do you judge my wit would
fly 


third citizen

nay  your wit will not so soon out as another man 
will strongly wedged up in a block head  but
if it were at liberty   twould  sure  southward 


second citizen

why that way 


third citizen

to lose itself in a fog  where being three parts
melted away with rotten dews  the fourth would return
for conscience sake  to help to get thee a wife 


second citizen

you are never without your tricks  you may  you may 


third citizen

are you all resolved to give your voices  but
that no matter  the greater part carries it  i
say  if he would incline to the people  there was
never a worthier man 
enter coriolanus in a gown of humility  with menenius
here he comes  and in the gown of humility  mark his
behavior  we are not to stay all together  but to
come by him where he stands  by ones  by twos  and
by threes  he to make his requests by
particulars  wherein every one of us has a single
honour  in giving him our own voices with our own
tongues  therefore follow me  and i direct you how
you shall go by him 


all

content  content 
exeunt citizens


menenius

 pray  sir plague upon t  i cannot bring
my tongue to such a pace look  sir  my wounds 
i got them in my country service  when
some certain of your brethren roar and ran
from the noise of our own drums 


menenius

o me  the gods 
you must not speak of that  you must desire them
to think upon you 


coriolanus

                  think upon me  hang  em 
i would they would forget me  like the virtues
which our divines lose by  em 


menenius

you mar all 
i leave you  pray you  speak to  em  i pray you 
in wholesome manner 
exit


coriolanus

bid them wash their faces
and keep their teeth clean 
re enter two of the citizens
so  here comes a brace 
re enter a third citizen
you know the cause  air  of my standing here 


third citizen

we do  sir  tell us what hath brought you to t 


coriolanus

mine own desert 


second citizen

your own desert 


coriolanus

ay  but not mine own desire 


third citizen

how not your own desire 


coriolanus

no  sir never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging 


third citizen

you must think  if we give you any thing  we hope to
gain by you 


coriolanus

well then  i pray  your price o  the consulship 


first citizen

the price is to ask it kindly 


coriolanus

kindly  sir  i pray  let me ha t  i have wounds to
show you  which shall be yours in private  your
good voice  sir  what say you 


second citizen

you shall ha  it  worthy sir 


coriolanus

a match  sir  there in all two worthy voices
begged  i have your alms  adieu 


third citizen

but this is something odd 


second citizen

an  to give again but  no matter 
exeunt the three citizens
re enter two other citizens


coriolanus

pray you now  if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that i may be consul  i have here the
customary gown 


fourth citizen

you have deserved nobly of your country  and you
have not deserved nobly 


coriolanus

your enigma 


fourth citizen

you have been a scourge to her enemies  you have
been a rod to her friends  you have not indeed loved
the common people 


coriolanus

you should account me the more virtuous that i have
not been common in my love  i will  sir  flatter my
sworn brother  the people  to earn a dearer
estimation of them   a condition they account
gentle  and since the wisdom of their choice is
rather to have my hat than my heart  i will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly  that is  sir  i will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers  therefore  beseech you 
i may be consul 


fifth citizen

we hope to find you our friend  and therefore give
you our voices heartily 


fourth citizen

you have received many wounds for your country 


coriolanus

i will not seal your knowledge with showing them  i
will make much of your voices  and so trouble you no further 


both citizens

the gods give you joy  sir  heartily 
exeunt


coriolanus

most sweet voices 
better it is to die  better to starve 
than crave the hire which first we do deserve 
why in this woolvish toge should i stand here 
to beg of hob and dick  that do appear 
their needless vouches  custom calls me to t 
what custom wills  in all things should we do t 
the dust on antique time would lie unswept 
and mountainous error be too highly heapt
for truth to o er peer  rather than fool it so 
let the high office and the honour go
to one that would do thus  i am half through 
the one part suffer d  the other will i do 
re enter three citizens more
here come more voices 
your voices  for your voices i have fought 
watch for your voices  for your voices bear
of wounds two dozen odd  battles thrice six
i have seen and heard of  for your voices have
done many things  some less  some more your voices 
indeed i would be consul 


sixth citizen

he has done nobly  and cannot go without any honest
man voice 


seventh citizen

therefore let him be consul  the gods give him joy 
and make him good friend to the people 


all citizens

amen  amen  god save thee  noble consul 
exeunt


coriolanus

worthy voices 
re enter menenius  with brutus and sicinius


menenius

you have stood your limitation  and the tribunes
endue you with the people voice  remains
that  in the official marks invested  you
anon do meet the senate 


coriolanus

is this done 


sicinius

the custom of request you have discharged 
the people do admit you  and are summon 
to meet anon  upon your approbation 


coriolanus

where  at the senate house 


sicinius

there  coriolanus 


coriolanus

may i change these garments 


sicinius

you may  sir 


coriolanus

that i straight do  and  knowing myself again 
repair to the senate house 


menenius

i keep you company  will you along 


brutus

we stay here for the people 


sicinius

fare you well 
exeunt coriolanus and menenius
he has it now  and by his looks methink
 warm at  heart 


brutus

with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds 
will you dismiss the people 
re enter citizens


sicinius

how now  my masters  have you chose this man 


first citizen

he has our voices  sir 


brutus

we pray the gods he may deserve your loves 


second citizen

amen  sir  to my poor unworthy notice 
he mock us when he begg our voices 


third citizen

certainly
he flouted us downright 


first citizen

no his kind of speech  he did not mock us 


second citizen

not one amongst us  save yourself  but says
he used us scornfully  he should have show us
his marks of merit  wounds received for country 


sicinius

why  so he did  i am sure 


citizens

no  no  no man saw  em 


third citizen

he said he had wounds  which he could show
in private 
and with his hat  thus waving it in scorn 
 would be consul  says he   custom 
but by your voices  will not so permit me 
your voices therefore  when we granted that 
here was  thank you for your voices  thank you 
your most sweet voices  now you have left
your voices 
i have no further with you  was not this mockery 


sicinius

why either were you ignorant to see t 
or  seeing it  of such childish friendliness
to yield your voices 


brutus

could you not have told him
as you were lesson d  when he had no power 
but was a petty servant to the state 
he was your enemy  ever spake against
your liberties and the charters that you bear
i  the body of the weal  and now  arriving
a place of potency and sway o  the state 
if he should still malignantly remain
fast foe to the plebeii  your voices might
be curses to yourselves  you should have said
that as his worthy deeds did claim no less
than what he stood for  so his gracious nature
would think upon you for your voices and
translate his malice towards you into love 
standing your friendly lord 


sicinius

thus to have said 
as you were fore advised  had touch his spirit
and tried his inclination  from him pluck 
either his gracious promise  which you might 
as cause had call you up  have held him to
or else it would have gall his surly nature 
which easily endures not article
tying him to aught  so putting him to rage 
you should have ta the advantage of his choler
and pass him unelected 


brutus

did you perceive
he did solicit you in free contempt
when he did need your loves  and do you think
that his contempt shall not be bruising to you 
when he hath power to crush  why  had your bodies
no heart among you  or had you tongues to cry
against the rectorship of judgment 


sicinius

have you
ere now denied the asker  and now again
of him that did not ask  but mock  bestow
your sued for tongues 


third citizen

he not confirm d  we may deny him yet 


second citizen

and will deny him 
i have five hundred voices of that sound 


first citizen

i twice five hundred and their friends to piece  em 


brutus

get you hence instantly  and tell those friends 
they have chose a consul that will from them take
their liberties  make them of no more voice
than dogs that are as often beat for barking
as therefore kept to do so 


sicinius

let them assemble 
and on a safer judgment all revoke
your ignorant election  enforce his pride 
and his old hate unto you  besides  forget not
with what contempt he wore the humble weed 
how in his suit he scorn you  but your loves 
thinking upon his services  took from you
the apprehension of his present portance 
which most gibingly  ungravely  he did fashion
after the inveterate hate he bears you 


brutus

lay
a fault on us  your tribunes  that we laboured 
no impediment between  but that you must
cast your election on him 


sicinius

say  you chose him
more after our commandment than as guided
by your own true affections  and that your minds 
preoccupied with what you rather must do
than what you should  made you against the grain
to voice him consul  lay the fault on us 


brutus

ay  spare us not  say we read lectures to you 
how youngly he began to serve his country 
how long continued  and what stock he springs of 
the noble house o  the marcians  from whence came
that ancus marcius  numa daughter son 
who  after great hostilius  here was king 
of the same house publius and quintus were 
that our beat water brought by conduits hither 
and   censorinus   nobly named so 
twice being   by the people chosen   censor 
was his great ancestor 


sicinius

one thus descended 
that hath beside well in his person wrought
to be set high in place  we did commend
to your remembrances  but you have found 
scaling his present bearing with his past 
that he your fixed enemy  and revoke
your sudden approbation 


brutus

say  you ne had done t 
harp on that still but by our putting on 
and presently  when you have drawn your number 
repair to the capitol 


all

we will so  almost all
repent in their election 
exeunt citizens


brutus

let them go on 
this mutiny were better put in hazard 
than stay  past doubt  for greater 
if  as his nature is  he fall in rage
with their refusal  both observe and answer
the vantage of his anger 


sicinius

to the capitol  come 
we will be there before the stream o  the people 
and this shall seem  as partly  tis  their own 
which we have goaded onward 
exeunt
