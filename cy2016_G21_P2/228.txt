scene i  rome  a street 


cornets  enter coriolanus  menenius  all the gentry  cominius  titus lartius  and other senators


coriolanus

tullus aufidius then had made new head 


lartius

he had  my lord  and that it was which caused
our swifter composition 


coriolanus

so then the volsces stand but as at first 
ready  when time shall prompt them  to make road 
upon again 


cominius

they are worn  lord consul  so 
that we shall hardly in our ages see
their banners wave again 


coriolanus

saw you aufidius 


lartius

on safe guard he  came to me  and did curse
against the volsces  for they had so vilely
yielded the town  he is retired to antium 


coriolanus

spoke he of me 


lartius

                  he did  my lord 


coriolanus

how  what 


lartius

how often he had met you  sword to sword 
that of all things upon the earth he hated
your person most  that he would pawn his fortunes
to hopeless restitution  so he might
be call your vanquisher 


coriolanus

at antium lives he 


lartius

at antium 


coriolanus

i wish i had a cause to seek him there 
to oppose his hatred fully  welcome home 
enter sicinius and brutus
behold  these are the tribunes of the people 
the tongues o  the common mouth  i do despise them 
for they do prank them in authority 
against all noble sufferance 


sicinius

pass no further 


coriolanus

ha  what is that 


brutus

it will be dangerous to go on  no further 


coriolanus

what makes this change 


menenius

the matter 


cominius

hath he not pass the noble and the common 


brutus

cominius  no 


coriolanus

                  have i had children voices 


first senator

tribunes  give way  he shall to the market place 


brutus

the people are incensed against him 


sicinius

stop 
or all will fall in broil 


coriolanus

are these your herd 
must these have voices  that can yield them now
and straight disclaim their tongues  what are
your offices 
you being their mouths  why rule you not their teeth 
have you not set them on 


menenius

be calm  be calm 


coriolanus

it is a purposed thing  and grows by plot 
to curb the will of the nobility 
suffer t  and live with such as cannot rule
nor ever will be ruled 


brutus

call not a plot 
the people cry you mock them  and of late 
when corn was given them gratis  you repined 
scandal the suppliants for the people  call them
time pleasers  flatterers  foes to nobleness 


coriolanus

why  this was known before 


brutus

not to them all 


coriolanus

have you inform them sithence 


brutus

how  i inform them 


coriolanus

you are like to do such business 


brutus

not unlike 
each way  to better yours 


coriolanus

why then should i be consul  by yond clouds 
let me deserve so ill as you  and make me
your fellow tribune 


sicinius

you show too much of that
for which the people stir  if you will pass
to where you are bound  you must inquire your way 
which you are out of  with a gentler spirit 
or never be so noble as a consul 
nor yoke with him for tribune 


menenius

let be calm 


cominius

the people are abused  set on  this paltering
becomes not rome  nor has coriolanus
deserved this so dishonour rub  laid falsely
i  the plain way of his merit 


coriolanus

tell me of corn 
this was my speech  and i will speak again 


menenius

not now  not now 


first senator

                  not in this heat  sir  now 


coriolanus

now  as i live  i will  my nobler friends 
i crave their pardons 
for the mutable  rank scented many  let them
regard me as i do not flatter  and
therein behold themselves  i say again 
in soothing them  we nourish  our senate
the cockle of rebellion  insolence  sedition 
which we ourselves have plough for  sow d 
and scatter d 
by mingling them with us  the honour number 
who lack not virtue  no  nor power  but that
which they have given to beggars 


menenius

well  no more 


first senator

no more words  we beseech you 


coriolanus

how  no more 
as for my country i have shed my blood 
not fearing outward force  so shall my lungs
coin words till their decay against those measles 
which we disdain should tatter us  yet sought
the very way to catch them 


brutus

you speak o  the people 
as if you were a god to punish  not
a man of their infirmity 


sicinius

 well
we let the people know t 


menenius

what  what  his choler 


coriolanus

choler 
were i as patient as the midnight sleep 
by jove   be my mind 


sicinius

it is a mind
that shall remain a poison where it is 
not poison any further 


coriolanus

shall remain 
hear you this triton of the minnows  mark you
his absolute  shall 


cominius

 from the canon 


coriolanus

 shall 
o good but most unwise patricians  why 
you grave but reckless senators  have you thus
given hydra here to choose an officer 
that with his peremptory  shall  being but
the horn and noise o  the monster s  wants not spirit
to say he turn your current in a ditch 
and make your channel his  if he have power
then vail your ignorance  if none  awake
your dangerous lenity  if you are learn d 
be not as common fools  if you are not 
let them have cushions by you  you are plebeians 
if they be senators  and they are no less 
when  both your voices blended  the great taste
most palates theirs  they choose their magistrate 
and such a one as he  who puts his  shall 
his popular  shall  against a graver bench
than ever frown in greece  by jove himself 
it makes the consuls base  and my soul aches
to know  when two authorities are up 
neither supreme  how soon confusion
may enter  the gap of both and take
the one by the other 


cominius

well  on to the market place 


coriolanus

whoever gave that counsel  to give forth
the corn o  the storehouse gratis  as  used
sometime in greece 


menenius

well  well  no more of that 


coriolanus

though there the people had more absolute power 
i say  they nourish disobedience  fed
the ruin of the state 


brutus

why  shall the people give
one that speaks thus their voice 


coriolanus

i give my reasons 
more worthier than their voices  they know the corn
was not our recompense  resting well assured
that ne did service for t  being press to the war 
even when the navel of the state was touch d 
they would not thread the gates  this kind of service
did not deserve corn gratis  being i  the war
their mutinies and revolts  wherein they show 
most valour  spoke not for them  the accusation
which they have often made against the senate 
all cause unborn  could never be the motive
of our so frank donation  well  what then 
how shall this bisson multitude digest
the senate courtesy  let deeds express
what like to be their words   did request it 
we are the greater poll  and in true fear
they gave us our demands  thus we debase
the nature of our seats and make the rabble
call our cares fears  which will in time
break ope the locks o  the senate and bring in
the crows to peck the eagles 


menenius

come  enough 


brutus

enough  with over measure 


coriolanus

no  take more 
what may be sworn by  both divine and human 
seal what i end withal  this double worship 
where one part does disdain with cause  the other
insult without all reason  where gentry  title  wisdom 
cannot conclude but by the yea and no
of general ignorance it must omit
real necessities  and give way the while
to unstable slightness  purpose so barr d 
it follows 
nothing is done to purpose  therefore  beseech you 
you that will be less fearful than discreet 
that love the fundamental part of state
more than you doubt the change on t  that prefer
a noble life before a long  and wish
to jump a body with a dangerous physic
that sure of death without it  at once pluck out
the multitudinous tongue  let them not lick
the sweet which is their poison  your dishonour
mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
of that integrity which should become t 
not having the power to do the good it would 
for the in which doth control t 


brutus

has said enough 


sicinius

has spoken like a traitor  and shall answer
as traitors do 


coriolanus

                  thou wretch  despite o thee 
what should the people do with these bald tribunes 
on whom depending  their obedience fails
to the greater bench  in a rebellion 
when what not meet  but what must be  was law 
then were they chosen  in a better hour 
let what is meet be said it must be meet 
and throw their power i  the dust 


brutus

manifest treason 


sicinius

                  this a consul  no 


brutus

the aediles  ho 
enter an aedile
let him be apprehended 


sicinius

go  call the people 
exit aedile
in whose name myself
attach thee as a traitorous innovator 
a foe to the public weal  obey  i charge thee 
and follow to thine answer 


coriolanus

hence  old goat 
senators     c	we surety him 


cominius

                  aged sir  hands off 


coriolanus

hence  rotten thing  or i shall shake thy bones
out of thy garments 


sicinius

help  ye citizens 
enter a rabble of citizens  plebeians  with the aediles


menenius

on both sides more respect 


sicinius

here he that would take from you all your power 


brutus

seize him  aediles 


citizens

 tribunes   patricians   citizens   what  ho 
 sicinius   brutus   coriolanus   citizens 
 peace  peace  peace   stay  hold  peace 


menenius

what is about to be  i am out of breath 
confusion near  i cannot speak  you  tribunes
to the people  coriolanus  patience 
speak  good sicinius 


sicinius

hear me  people  peace 


citizens

let hear our tribune  peace speak  speak  speak 


sicinius

you are at point to lose your liberties 
marcius would have all from you  marcius 
whom late you have named for consul 


menenius

fie  fie  fie 
this is the way to kindle  not to quench 


first senator

to unbuild the city and to lay all flat 


sicinius

what is the city but the people 


citizens

true 
the people are the city 


brutus

by the consent of all  we were establish 
the people magistrates 


citizens

you so remain 


menenius

and so are like to do 


cominius

that is the way to lay the city flat 
to bring the roof to the foundation 
and bury all  which yet distinctly ranges 
in heaps and piles of ruin 


sicinius

this deserves death 


brutus

or let us stand to our authority 
or let us lose it  we do here pronounce 
upon the part o  the people  in whose power
we were elected theirs  marcius is worthy
of present death 


sicinius

                  therefore lay hold of him 
bear him to the rock tarpeian  and from thence
into destruction cast him 


brutus

aediles  seize him 


citizens

yield  marcius  yield 


menenius

hear me one word 
beseech you  tribunes  hear me but a word 


aedile

peace  peace 


menenius

 to brutus   be that you seem  truly your
country friend 
and temperately proceed to what you would
thus violently redress 


brutus

sir  those cold ways 
that seem like prudent helps  are very poisonous
where the disease is violent  lay hands upon him 
and bear him to the rock 


coriolanus

no  i die here 
drawing his sword
there some among you have beheld me fighting 
come  try upon yourselves what you have seen me 


menenius

down with that sword  tribunes  withdraw awhile 


brutus

lay hands upon him 


cominius

help marcius  help 
you that be noble  help him  young and old 


citizens

down with him  down with him 
in this mutiny  the tribunes  the aediles  and the people  are beat in


menenius

go  get you to your house  be gone  away 
all will be naught else 


second senator

get you gone 


cominius

stand fast 
we have as many friends as enemies 


menenius

sham it be put to that 


first senator

the gods forbid 
i prithee  noble friend  home to thy house 
leave us to cure this cause 


menenius

for  a sore upon us 
you cannot tent yourself  be gone  beseech you 


cominius

come  sir  along with us 


coriolanus

i would they were barbarians as they are 
though in rome litter d not romans as they are not 
though calved i  the porch o  the capitol 


menenius

be gone 
put not your worthy rage into your tongue 
one time will owe another 


coriolanus

on fair ground
i could beat forty of them 


cominius

i could myself
take up a brace o  the best of them  yea  the
two tribunes 
but now  odds beyond arithmetic 
and manhood is call foolery  when it stands
against a falling fabric  will you hence 
before the tag return  whose rage doth rend
like interrupted waters and o 
what they are used to bear 


menenius

pray you  be gone 
i try whether my old wit be in request
with those that have but little  this must be patch 
with cloth of any colour 


cominius

nay  come away 
exeunt coriolanus  cominius  and others


a patrician

this man has marr his fortune 


menenius

his nature is too noble for the world 
he would not flatter neptune for his trident 
or jove for power to thunder  his heart his mouth 
what his breast forges  that his tongue must vent 
and  being angry  does forget that ever
he heard the name of death 
a noise within
here goodly work 


second patrician

i would they were abed 


menenius

i would they were in tiber  what the vengeance 
could he not speak  fair 
re enter brutus and sicinius  with the rabble


sicinius

where is this viper
that would depopulate the city and
be every man himself 


menenius

you worthy tribunes 


sicinius

he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock
with rigorous hands  he hath resisted law 
and therefore law shall scorn him further trial
than the severity of the public power
which he so sets at nought 


first citizen

he shall well know
the noble tribunes are the people mouths 
and we their hands 


citizens

he shall  sure on t 


menenius

sir  sir 


sicinius

peace 


menenius

do not cry havoc  where you should but hunt
with modest warrant 


sicinius

sir  how comes that you
have holp to make this rescue 


menenius

hear me speak 
as i do know the consul worthiness 
so can i name his faults 


sicinius

consul  what consul 


menenius

the consul coriolanus 


brutus

he consul 


citizens

no  no  no  no  no 


menenius

if  by the tribunes  leave  and yours  good people 
i may be heard  i would crave a word or two 
the which shall turn you to no further harm
than so much loss of time 


sicinius

speak briefly then 
for we are peremptory to dispatch
this viperous traitor  to eject him hence
were but one danger  and to keep him here
our certain death  therefore it is decreed
he dies to night 


menenius

                  now the good gods forbid
that our renowned rome  whose gratitude
towards her deserved children is enroll 
in jove own book  like an unnatural dam
should now eat up her own 


sicinius

he a disease that must be cut away 


menenius

o  he a limb that has but a disease 
mortal  to cut it off  to cure it  easy 
what has he done to rome that worthy death 
killing our enemies  the blood he hath lost 
which  i dare vouch  is more than that he hath 
by many an ounce he dropp it for his country 
and what is left  to lose it by his country 
were to us all  that do and suffer it 
a brand to the end o  the world 


sicinius

this is clean kam 


brutus

merely awry  when he did love his country 
it honour him 


menenius

                  the service of the foot
being once gangrened  is not then respected
for what before it was 


brutus

we hear no more 
pursue him to his house  and pluck him thence 
lest his infection  being of catching nature 
spread further 


menenius

                  one word more  one word 
this tiger footed rage  when it shall find
the harm of unscann swiftness  will too late
tie leaden pounds to heels  proceed by process 
lest parties  as he is beloved  break out 
and sack great rome with romans 


brutus

if it were so 


sicinius

what do ye talk 
have we not had a taste of his obedience 
our aediles smote  ourselves resisted  come 


menenius

consider this  he has been bred i  the wars
since he could draw a sword  and is ill school 
in bolted language  meal and bran together
he throws without distinction  give me leave 
i go to him  and undertake to bring him
where he shall answer  by a lawful form 
in peace  to his utmost peril 


first senator

noble tribunes 
it is the humane way  the other course
will prove too bloody  and the end of it
unknown to the beginning 


sicinius

noble menenius 
be you then as the people officer 
masters  lay down your weapons 


brutus

go not home 


sicinius

meet on the market place  we attend you there 
where  if you bring not marcius  we proceed
in our first way 


menenius

                  i bring him to you 
to the senators
let me desire your company  he must come 
or what is worst will follow 


first senator

pray you  let to him 
exeunt
