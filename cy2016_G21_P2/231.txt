scene i  rome  before a gate of the city 


enter coriolanus  volumnia  virgilia  menenius  cominius  with the young nobility of rome


coriolanus

come  leave your tears  a brief farewell  the beast
with many heads butts me away  nay  mother 
where is your ancient courage  you were used
to say extremity was the trier of spirits 
that common chances common men could bear 
that when the sea was calm all boats alike
show mastership in floating  fortune blows 
when most struck home  being gentle wounded  craves
a noble cunning  you were used to load me
with precepts that would make invincible
the heart that conn them 


virgilia

o heavens  o heavens 


coriolanus

nay  prithee  woman 


volumnia

now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome 
and occupations perish 


coriolanus

what  what  what 
i shall be loved when i am lack d  nay  mother 
resume that spirit  when you were wont to say 
if you had been the wife of hercules 
six of his labours you have done  and saved
your husband so much sweat  cominius 
droop not  adieu  farewell  my wife  my mother 
i do well yet  thou old and true menenius 
thy tears are salter than a younger man s 
and venomous to thine eyes  my sometime general 
i have seen thee stem  and thou hast oft beheld
heart hardening spectacles  tell these sad women
 fond to wail inevitable strokes 
as  to laugh at  em  my mother  you wot well
my hazards still have been your solace  and
believe not lightly though i go alone 
like to a lonely dragon  that his fen
makes fear and talk of more than seen your son
will or exceed the common or be caught
with cautelous baits and practise 


volumnia

my first son 
whither wilt thou go  take good cominius
with thee awhile  determine on some course 
more than a wild exposture to each chance
that starts i  the way before thee 


coriolanus

o the gods 


cominius

i follow thee a month  devise with thee
where thou shalt rest  that thou mayst hear of us
and we of thee  so if the time thrust forth
a cause for thy repeal  we shall not send
o the vast world to seek a single man 
and lose advantage  which doth ever cool
i  the absence of the needer 


coriolanus

fare ye well 
thou hast years upon thee  and thou art too full
of the wars  surfeits  to go rove with one
that yet unbruised  bring me but out at gate 
come  my sweet wife  my dearest mother  and
my friends of noble touch  when i am forth 
bid me farewell  and smile  i pray you  come 
while i remain above the ground  you shall
hear from me still  and never of me aught
but what is like me formerly 


menenius

that worthily
as any ear can hear  come  let not weep 
if i could shake off but one seven years
from these old arms and legs  by the good gods 
i with thee every foot 


coriolanus

give me thy hand  come 
exeunt
