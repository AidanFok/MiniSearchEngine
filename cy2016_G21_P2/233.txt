roman

i know you well  sir  and you know
me  your name  i think  is adrian 


volsce

roman

i am a roman  and my services are 
as you are  against  em  know you me yet 


volsce

nicanor  no 


roman

the same  sir 


volsce

you had more beard when i last saw you  but your
favour is well approved by your tongue  what the
news in rome  i have a note from the volscian state 
to find you out there  you have well saved me a
day journey 


roman

there hath been in rome strange insurrections  the
people against the senators  patricians  and nobles 


volsce

hath been  is it ended  then  our state thinks not
so  they are in a most warlike preparation  and
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division 


roman

the main blaze of it is past  but a small thing
would make it flame again  for the nobles receive
so to heart the banishment of that worthy
coriolanus  that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people and to pluck from them
their tribunes for ever  this lies glowing  i can
tell you  and is almost mature for the violent
breaking out 


volsce

coriolanus banished 


roman

banished  sir 


volsce

you will be welcome with this intelligence  nicanor 


roman

the day serves well for them now  i have heard it
said  the fittest time to corrupt a man wife is
when she fallen out with her husband  your noble
tullus aufidius will appear well in these wars  his
great opposer  coriolanus  being now in no request
of his country 


volsce

he cannot choose  i am most fortunate  thus
accidentally to encounter you  you have ended my
business  and i will merrily accompany you home 


roman

i shall  between this and supper  tell you most
strange things from rome  all tending to the good of
their adversaries  have you an army ready  say you 


volsce

a most royal one  the centurions and their charges 
distinctly billeted  already in the entertainment 
and to be on foot at an hour warning 


roman

i am joyful to hear of their readiness  and am the
man  i think  that shall set them in present action 
so  sir  heartily well met  and most glad of your company 


volsce

you take my part from me  sir  i have the most cause
to be glad of yours 


roman

well  let us go together
