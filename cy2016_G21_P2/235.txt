whence comest thou  what wouldst thou  thy name 
why speak not  speak  man  what thy name 


coriolanus

if  tullus 
unmuffling
not yet thou knowest me  and  seeing me  dost not
think me for the man i am  necessity
commands me name myself 


aufidius

what is thy name 


coriolanus

a name unmusical to the volscians  ears 
and harsh in sound to thine 


aufidius

say  what thy name 
thou hast a grim appearance  and thy face
bears a command in t  though thy tackle torn 
thou show a noble vessel  what thy name 


coriolanus

prepare thy brow to frown  know 
thou me yet 


aufidius

i know thee not  thy name 


coriolanus

my name is caius marcius  who hath done
to thee particularly and to all the volsces
great hurt and mischief  thereto witness may
my surname  coriolanus  the painful service 
the extreme dangers and the drops of blood
shed for my thankless country are requited
but with that surname  a good memory 
and witness of the malice and displeasure
which thou shouldst bear me  only that name remains 
the cruelty and envy of the people 
permitted by our dastard nobles  who
have all forsook me  hath devour the rest 
and suffer me by the voice of slaves to be
whoop out of rome  now this extremity
hath brought me to thy hearth  not out of hope 
mistake me not to save my life  for if
i had fear death  of all the men i  the world
i would have  thee  but in mere spite 
to be full quit of those my banishers 
stand i before thee here  then if thou hast
a heart of wreak in thee  that wilt revenge
thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
of shame seen through thy country  speed
thee straight 
and make my misery serve thy turn  so use it
that my revengeful services may prove
as benefits to thee  for i will fight
against my canker country with the spleen
of all the under fiends  but if so be
thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
thou tired  then  in a word  i also am
longer to live most weary  and present
my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice 
which not to cut would show thee but a fool 
since i have ever follow thee with hate 
drawn tuns of blood out of thy country breast 
and cannot live but to thy shame  unless
it be to do thee service 


aufidius

o marcius  marcius 
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
a root of ancient envy  if jupiter
should from yond cloud speak divine things 
and say  true  i not believe them more
than thee  all noble marcius  let me twine
mine arms about that body  where against
my grained ash an hundred times hath broke
and scarr the moon with splinters  here i clip
the anvil of my sword  and do contest
as hotly and as nobly with thy love
as ever in ambitious strength i did
contend against thy valour  know thou first 
i loved the maid i married  never man
sigh truer breath  but that i see thee here 
thou noble thing  more dances my rapt heart
than when i first my wedded mistress saw
bestride my threshold  why  thou mars  i tell thee 
we have a power on foot  and i had purpose
once more to hew thy target from thy brawn 
or lose mine arm fort  thou hast beat me out
twelve several times  and i have nightly since
dreamt of encounters  thyself and me 
we have been down together in my sleep 
unbuckling helms  fisting each other throat 
and waked half dead with nothing  worthy marcius 
had we no quarrel else to rome  but that
thou art thence banish d  we would muster all
from twelve to seventy  and pouring war
into the bowels of ungrateful rome 
like a bold flood o er bear  o  come  go in 
and take our friendly senators by the hands 
who now are here  taking their leaves of me 
who am prepared against your territories 
though not for rome itself 


coriolanus

you bless me  gods 


aufidius

therefore  most absolute sir  if thou wilt have
the leading of thine own revenges  take
the one half of my commission  and set down 
as best thou art experienced  since thou know 
thy country strength and weakness thine own ways 
whether to knock against the gates of rome 
or rudely visit them in parts remote 
to fright them  ere destroy  but come in 
let me commend thee first to those that shall
say yea to thy desires  a thousand welcomes 
and more a friend than e an enemy 
yet  marcius  that was much  your hand  most welcome 
exeunt coriolanus and aufidius  the two servingmen come forward


first servingman

here a strange alteration 


second servingman

by my hand  i had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel  and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him 


first servingman

what an arm he has  he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb  as one would set up a top 


second servingman

nay  i knew by his face that there was something in
him  he had  sir  a kind of face  methought i
cannot tell how to term it 


first servingman

he had so  looking as it were would i were hanged 
but i thought there was more in him than i could think 


second servingman

so did i  i be sworn  he is simply the rarest
man i  the world 


first servingman

i think he is  but a greater soldier than he you wot on 


second servingman

who  my master 


first servingman

nay  it no matter for that 


second servingman

worth six on him 


first servingman

nay  not so neither  but i take him to be the
greater soldier 


second servingman

faith  look you  one cannot tell how to say that 
for the defence of a town  our general is excellent 


first servingman

ay  and for an assault too 
re enter third servingman


third servingman

o slaves  i can tell you news  news  you rascals 


first servingman

second servingman

what  what  what  let partake 


third servingman

i would not be a roman  of all nations  i had as
lieve be a condemned man 


first servingman

second servingman

wherefore  wherefore 


third servingman

why  here he that was wont to thwack our general 
caius marcius 


first servingman

why do you say  our general  


third servingman

i do not say  our general  but he was always
good enough for him 


second servingman

come  we are fellows and friends  he was ever too
hard for him  i have heard him say so himself 


first servingman

he was too hard for him directly  to say the troth
on t  before corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado 


second servingman

an he had been cannibally given  he might have
broiled and eaten him too 


first servingman

but  more of thy news 


third servingman

why  he is so made on here within  as if he were son
and heir to mars  set at upper end o  the table  no
question asked him by any of the senators  but they
stand bald before him  our general himself makes a
mistress of him  sanctifies himself with hand and
turns up the white o  the eye to his discourse  but
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i 
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday  for the other has half  by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table  he go  he says 
and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears  he
will mow all down before him  and leave his passage polled 


second servingman

and he as like to do as any man i can imagine 


third servingman

do t  he will do t  for  look you  sir  he has as
many friends as enemies  which friends  sir  as it
were  durst not  look you  sir  show themselves  as
we term it  his friends whilst he in directitude 


first servingman

directitude  what that 


third servingman

but when they shall see  sir  his crest up again 
and the man in blood  they will out of their
burrows  like conies after rain  and revel all with
him 


first servingman

but when goes this forward 


third servingman

to morrow  to day  presently  you shall have the
drum struck up this afternoon   tis  as it were  a
parcel of their feast  and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips 


second servingman

why  then we shall have a stirring world again 
this peace is nothing  but to rust iron  increase
tailors  and breed ballad makers 


first servingman

let me have war  say i  it exceeds peace as far as
day does night  it spritely  waking  audible  and
full of vent  peace is a very apoplexy  lethargy 
mulled  deaf  sleepy  insensible  a getter of more
bastard children than war a destroyer of men 


second servingman

 so  and as war  in some sort  may be said to
be a ravisher  so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds 


first servingman

ay  and it makes men hate one another 


third servingman

reason  because they then less need one another 
the wars for my money  i hope to see romans as cheap
as volscians  they are rising  they are rising 


all
