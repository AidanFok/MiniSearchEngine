scene vi  rome  a public place 


enter sicinius and brutus


sicinius

we hear not of him  neither need we fear him 
his remedies are tame i  the present peace
and quietness of the people  which before
were in wild hurry  here do we make his friends
blush that the world goes well  who rather had 
though they themselves did suffer by t  behold
dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
our tradesmen with in their shops and going
about their functions friendly 


brutus

we stood to in good time 
enter menenius
is this menenius 


sicinius

 he he  o  he is grown most kind of late 


both tribunes

hail sir 


menenius

        hail to you both 


sicinius

your coriolanus
is not much miss d  but with his friends 
the commonwealth doth stand  and so would do 
were he more angry at it 


menenius

all well  and might have been much better  if
he could have temporized 


sicinius

where is he  hear you 


menenius

nay  i hear nothing  his mother and his wife
hear nothing from him 
enter three or four citizens


citizens

the gods preserve you both 


sicinius

god den  our neighbours 


brutus

god den to you all  god den to you all 


first citizen

ourselves  our wives  and children  on our knees 
are bound to pray for you both 


sicinius

live  and thrive 


brutus

farewell  kind neighbours  we wish coriolanus
had loved you as we did 


citizens

now the gods keep you 


both tribunes

farewell  farewell 
exeunt citizens


sicinius

this is a happier and more comely time
than when these fellows ran about the streets 
crying confusion 


brutus

                  caius marcius was
a worthy officer i  the war  but insolent 
o with pride  ambitious past all thinking 
self loving 


sicinius

                  and affecting one sole throne 
without assistance 


menenius

i think not so 


sicinius

we should by this  to all our lamentation 
if he had gone forth consul  found it so 


brutus

the gods have well prevented it  and rome
sits safe and still without him 
enter an aedile


aedile

worthy tribunes 
there is a slave  whom we have put in prison 
reports  the volsces with two several powers
are enter in the roman territories 
and with the deepest malice of the war
destroy what lies before  em 


menenius

 aufidius 
who  hearing of our marcius  banishment 
thrusts forth his horns again into the world 
which were inshell when marcius stood for rome 
and durst not once peep out 


sicinius

come  what talk you
of marcius 


brutus

go see this rumourer whipp d  it cannot be
the volsces dare break with us 


menenius

cannot be 
we have record that very well it can 
and three examples of the like have been
within my age  but reason with the fellow 
before you punish him  where he heard this 
lest you shall chance to whip your information
and beat the messenger who bids beware
of what is to be dreaded 


sicinius

tell not me 
i know this cannot be 


brutus

not possible 
enter a messenger


messenger

the nobles in great earnestness are going
all to the senate house  some news is come
that turns their countenances 


sicinius

 this slave 
go whip him   the people eyes his raising 
nothing but his report 


messenger

yes  worthy sir 
the slave report is seconded  and more 
more fearful  is deliver d 


sicinius

what more fearful 


messenger

it is spoke freely out of many mouths 
how probable i do not know that marcius 
join with aufidius  leads a power  rome 
and vows revenge as spacious as between
the young and oldest thing 


sicinius

this is most likely 


brutus

raised only  that the weaker sort may wish
good marcius home again 


sicinius

the very trick on t 


menenius

this is unlikely 
he and aufidius can no more atone
than violentest contrariety 
enter a second messenger


second messenger

you are sent for to the senate 
a fearful army  led by caius marcius
associated with aufidius  rages
upon our territories  and have already
o their way  consumed with fire  and took
what lay before them 
enter cominius


cominius

o  you have made good work 


menenius

what news  what news 


cominius

you have holp to ravish your own daughters and
to melt the city leads upon your pates 
to see your wives dishonour to your noses 


menenius

what the news  what the news 


cominius

your temples burned in their cement  and
your franchises  whereon you stood  confined
into an auger bore 


menenius

pray now  your news 
you have made fair work  i fear me pray  your news 
if marcius should be join with volscians 


cominius

if 
he is their god  he leads them like a thing
made by some other deity than nature 
that shapes man better  and they follow him 
against us brats  with no less confidence
than boys pursuing summer butterflies 
or butchers killing flies 


menenius

you have made good work 
you and your apron men  you that stood so up much
on the voice of occupation and
the breath of garlic eaters 


cominius

he will shake
your rome about your ears 


menenius

as hercules
did shake down mellow fruit 
you have made fair work 


brutus

but is this true  sir 


cominius

ay  and you look pale
before you find it other  all the regions
do smilingly revolt  and who resist
are mock for valiant ignorance 
and perish constant fools  who is can blame him 
your enemies and his find something in him 


menenius

we are all undone  unless
the noble man have mercy 


cominius

who shall ask it 
the tribunes cannot do for shame  the people
deserve such pity of him as the wolf
does of the shepherds  for his best friends  if they
should say  good to rome  they charged him even
as those should do that had deserved his hate 
and therein show like enemies 


menenius

 true 
if he were putting to my house the brand
that should consume it  i have not the face
to say  you  cease  you have made fair hands 
you and your crafts  you have crafted fair 


cominius

you have brought
a trembling upon rome  such as was never
so incapable of help 


both tribunes

say not we brought it 


menenius

how  was it we  we loved him but  like beasts
and cowardly nobles  gave way unto your clusters 
who did hoot him out o  the city 


cominius

but i fear
they roar him in again  tullus aufidius 
the second name of men  obeys his points
as if he were his officer  desperation
is all the policy  strength and defence 
that rome can make against them 
enter a troop of citizens


menenius

here come the clusters 
and is aufidius with him  you are they
that made the air unwholesome  when you cast
your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
coriolanus  exile  now he coming 
and not a hair upon a soldier head
which will not prove a whip  as many coxcombs
as you threw caps up will he tumble down 
and pay you for your voices   no matter 
if he could burn us all into one coal 
we have deserved it 


citizens

faith  we hear fearful news 


first citizen

for mine own part 
when i said  banish him  i said  pity 


second citizen

and so did i 


third citizen

and so did i  and  to say the truth  so did very
many of us  that we did  we did for the best  and
though we willingly consented to his banishment  yet
it was against our will 


cominius

ye re goodly things  you voices 


menenius

you have made
good work  you and your cry  shall to the capitol 


cominius

o  ay  what else 
exeunt cominius and menenius


sicinius

go  masters  get you home  be not dismay d 
these are a side that would be glad to have
this true which they so seem to fear  go home 
and show no sign of fear 


first citizen

the gods be good to us  come  masters  let home 
i ever said we were i  the wrong when we banished
him 


second citizen

so did we all  but  come  let home 
exeunt citizens


brutus

i do not like this news 


sicinius

nor i 


brutus

let to the capitol  would half my wealth
would buy this for a lie 


sicinius

pray  let us go 
exeunt
