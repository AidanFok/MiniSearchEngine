scene vii  a camp  at a small distance from rome 


enter aufidius and his lieutenant


aufidius

do they still fly to the roman 


lieutenant

i do not know what witchcraft in him  but
your soldiers use him as the grace  meat 
their talk at table  and their thanks at end 
and you are darken in this action  sir 
even by your own 


aufidius

                  i cannot help it now 
unless  by using means  i lame the foot
of our design  he bears himself more proudlier 
even to my person  than i thought he would
when first i did embrace him  yet his nature
in that no changeling  and i must excuse
what cannot be amended 


lieutenant

yet i wish  sir 
i mean for your particular you had not
join in commission with him  but either
had borne the action of yourself  or else
to him had left it solely 


aufidius

i understand thee well  and be thou sure 
when he shall come to his account  he knows not
what i can urge against him  although it seems 
and so he thinks  and is no less apparent
to the vulgar eye  that he bears all things fairly 
and shows good husbandry for the volscian state 
fights dragon like  and does achieve as soon
as draw his sword  yet he hath left undone
that which shall break his neck or hazard mine 
whene we come to our account 


lieutenant

sir  i beseech you  think you he carry rome 


aufidius

all places yield to him ere he sits down 
and the nobility of rome are his 
the senators and patricians love him too 
the tribunes are no soldiers  and their people
will be as rash in the repeal  as hasty
to expel him thence  i think he be to rome
as is the osprey to the fish  who takes it
by sovereignty of nature  first he was
a noble servant to them  but he could not
carry his honours even  whether  pride 
which out of daily fortune ever taints
the happy man  whether defect of judgment 
to fail in the disposing of those chances
which he was lord of  or whether nature 
not to be other than one thing  not moving
from the casque to the cushion  but commanding peace
even with the same austerity and garb
as he controll the war  but one of these 
as he hath spices of them all  not all 
for i dare so far free him made him fear d 
so hated  and so banish d  but he has a merit 
to choke it in the utterance  so our virtues
lie in the interpretation of the time 
and power  unto itself most commendable 
hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
to extol what it hath done 
one fire drives out one fire  one nail  one nail 
rights by rights falter  strengths by strengths do fail 
come  let away  when  caius  rome is thine 
thou art poor of all  then shortly art thou mine 
exeunt
