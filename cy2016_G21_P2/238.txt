scene i  rome  a public place 


enter menenius  cominius  sicinius  brutus  and others


menenius

no  i not go  you hear what he hath said
which was sometime his general  who loved him
in a most dear particular  he call me father 
but what o  that  go  you that banish him 
a mile before his tent fall down  and knee
the way into his mercy  nay  if he coy 
to hear cominius speak  i keep at home 


cominius

he would not seem to know me 


menenius

do you hear 


cominius

yet one time he did call me by my name 
i urged our old acquaintance  and the drops
that we have bled together  coriolanus
he would not answer to  forbad all names 
he was a kind of nothing  titleless 
till he had forged himself a name o  the fire
of burning rome 


menenius

why  so  you have made good work 
a pair of tribunes that have rack for rome 
to make coals cheap a noble memory 


cominius

i minded him how royal  to pardon
when it was less expected  he replied 
it was a bare petition of a state
to one whom they had punish d 


menenius

very well 
could he say less 


cominius

i offer to awaken his regard
for private friends  his answer to me was 
he could not stay to pick them in a pile
of noisome musty chaff  he said  folly 
for one poor grain or two  to leave unburnt 
and still to nose the offence 


menenius

for one poor grain or two 
i am one of those  his mother  wife  his child 
and this brave fellow too  we are the grains 
you are the musty chaff  and you are smelt
above the moon  we must be burnt for you 


sicinius

nay  pray  be patient  if you refuse your aid
in this so never needed help  yet do not
upbraid with our distress  but  sure  if you
would be your country pleader  your good tongue 
more than the instant army we can make 
might stop our countryman 


menenius

no  i not meddle 


sicinius

pray you  go to him 


menenius

what should i do 


brutus

only make trial what your love can do
for rome  towards marcius 


menenius

well  and say that marcius
return me  as cominius is return d 
unheard  what then 
but as a discontented friend  grief shot
with his unkindness  say be so 


sicinius

yet your good will
must have that thanks from rome  after the measure
as you intended well 


menenius

i undertake  t 
i think he hear me  yet  to bite his lip
and hum at good cominius  much unhearts me 
he was not taken well  he had not dined 
the veins unfill d  our blood is cold  and then
we pout upon the morning  are unapt
to give or to forgive  but when we have stuff 
these and these conveyances of our blood
with wine and feeding  we have suppler souls
than in our priest like fasts  therefore i watch him
till he be dieted to my request 
and then i set upon him 


brutus

you know the very road into his kindness 
and cannot lose your way 


menenius

good faith  i prove him 
speed how it will  i shall ere long have knowledge
of my success 
exit


cominius

                  he never hear him 


sicinius

not 


cominius

i tell you  he does sit in gold  his eye
red as  burn rome  and his injury
the gaoler to his pity  i kneel before him 
 very faintly he said  rise  dismiss me
thus  with his speechless hand  what he would do 
he sent in writing after me  what he would not 
bound with an oath to yield to his conditions 
so that all hope is vain 
unless his noble mother  and his wife 
who  as i hear  mean to solicit him
for mercy to his country  therefore  let hence 
and with our fair entreaties haste them on 
exeunt
