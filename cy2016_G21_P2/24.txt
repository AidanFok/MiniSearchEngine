scene i  before orleans 


enter a sergeant of a band with two sentinels


sergeant

sirs  take your places and be vigilant 
if any noise or soldier you perceive
near to the walls  by some apparent sign
let us have knowledge at the court of guard 


first sentinel

sergeant  you shall 
exit sergeant
thus are poor servitors 
when others sleep upon their quiet beds 
constrain to watch in darkness  rain and cold 
enter talbot  bedford  burgundy  and forces  with scaling ladders  their drums beating a dead march


talbot

lord regent  and redoubted burgundy 
by whose approach the regions of artois 
wallon and picardy are friends to us 
this happy night the frenchmen are secure 
having all day caroused and banqueted 
embrace we then this opportunity
as fitting best to quittance their deceit
contrived by art and baleful sorcery 


bedford

coward of france  how much he wrongs his fame 
despairing of his own arm fortitude 
to join with witches and the help of hell 


burgundy

traitors have never other company 
but what that pucelle whom they term so pure 


talbot

a maid  they say 


bedford

                  a maid  and be so martial 


burgundy

pray god she prove not masculine ere long 
if underneath the standard of the french
she carry armour as she hath begun 


talbot

well  let them practise and converse with spirits 
god is our fortress  in whose conquering name
let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks 


bedford

ascend  brave talbot  we will follow thee 


talbot

not all together  better far  i guess 
that we do make our entrance several ways 
that  if it chance the one of us do fail 
the other yet may rise against their force 


bedford

agreed  i to yond corner 


burgundy

and i to this 


talbot

and here will talbot mount  or make his grave 
now  salisbury  for thee  and for the right
of english henry  shall this night appear
how much in duty i am bound to both 


sentinels

arm  arm  the enemy doth make assault 
cry   st  george   talbot 
the french leap over the walls in their shirts   enter  several ways  the bastard of orleans  alencon  and reignier  half ready  and half unready


alencon

how now  my lords  what  all unready so 


bastard of orleans

unready  ay  and glad we  so well 


reignier

 time  i trow  to wake and leave our beds 
hearing alarums at our chamber doors 


alencon

of all exploits since first i follow arms 
ne heard i of a warlike enterprise
more venturous or desperate than this 


bastard of orleans

i think this talbot be a fiend of hell 


reignier

if not of hell  the heavens  sure  favour him 


alencon

here cometh charles  i marvel how he sped 


bastard of orleans

tut  holy joan was his defensive guard 
enter charles and joan la pucelle


charles

is this thy cunning  thou deceitful dame 
didst thou at first  to flatter us withal 
make us partakers of a little gain 
that now our loss might be ten times so much 


joan la pucelle

wherefore is charles impatient with his friend 
at all times will you have my power alike 
sleeping or waking must i still prevail 
or will you blame and lay the fault on me 
improvident soldiers  had your watch been good 
this sudden mischief never could have fall n 


charles

duke of alencon  this was your default 
that  being captain of the watch to night 
did look no better to that weighty charge 


alencon

had all your quarters been as safely kept
as that whereof i had the government 
we had not been thus shamefully surprised 


bastard of orleans

mine was secure 


reignier

                  and so was mine  my lord 


charles

and  for myself  most part of all this night 
within her quarter and mine own precinct
i was employ in passing to and fro 
about relieving of the sentinels 
then how or which way should they first break in 


joan la pucelle

question  my lords  no further of the case 
how or which way   sure they found some place
but weakly guarded  where the breach was made 
and now there rests no other shift but this 
to gather our soldiers  scatter and dispersed 
and lay new platforms to endamage them 
alarum  enter an english soldier  crying   talbot  a talbot  they fly  leaving their clothes behind


soldier

i be so bold to take what they have left 
the cry of talbot serves me for a sword 
for i have loaden me with many spoils 
using no other weapon but his name 
exit
