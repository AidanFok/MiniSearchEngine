enter coriolanus  aufidius  and others


coriolanus

we will before the walls of rome tomorrow
set down our host  my partner in this action 
you must report to the volscian lords  how plainly
i have borne this business 


aufidius

only their ends
you have respected  stopp your ears against
the general suit of rome  never admitted
a private whisper  no  not with such friends
that thought them sure of you 


coriolanus

this last old man 
whom with a crack heart i have sent to rome 
loved me above the measure of a father 
nay  godded me  indeed  their latest refuge
was to send him  for whose old love i have 
though i show sourly to him  once more offer 
the first conditions  which they did refuse
and cannot now accept  to grace him only
that thought he could do more  a very little
i have yielded to  fresh embassies and suits 
nor from the state nor private friends  hereafter
will i lend ear to  ha  what shout is this 
shout within
shall i be tempted to infringe my vow
in the same time  made  i will not 
enter in mourning habits  virgilia  volumnia  leading young marcius  valeria  and attendants
my wife comes foremost  then the honour mould
wherein this trunk was framed  and in her hand
the grandchild to her blood  but  out  affection 
all bond and privilege of nature  break 
let it be virtuous to be obstinate 
what is that curt worth  or those doves  eyes 
which can make gods forsworn  i melt  and am not
of stronger earth than others  my mother bows 
as if olympus to a molehill should
in supplication nod  and my young boy
hath an aspect of intercession  which
great nature cries  not  let the volsces
plough rome and harrow italy  i never
be such a gosling to obey instinct  but stand 
as if a man were author of himself
and knew no other kin 


virgilia

my lord and husband 


coriolanus

these eyes are not the same i wore in rome 


virgilia

the sorrow that delivers us thus changed
makes you think so 


coriolanus

like a dull actor now 
i have forgot my part  and i am out 
even to a full disgrace  best of my flesh 
forgive my tyranny  but do not say
for that  our romans  o  a kiss
long as my exile  sweet as my revenge 
now  by the jealous queen of heaven  that kiss
i carried from thee  dear  and my true lip
hath virgin it e since  you gods  i prate 
and the most noble mother of the world
leave unsaluted  sink  my knee  i  the earth 
kneels
of thy deep duty more impression show
than that of common sons 


volumnia

o  stand up blest 
whilst  with no softer cushion than the flint 
i kneel before thee  and unproperly
show duty  as mistaken all this while
between the child and parent 
kneels


coriolanus

what is this 
your knees to me  to your corrected son 
then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
fillip the stars  then let the mutinous winds
strike the proud cedars  the fiery sun 
murdering impossibility  to make
what cannot be  slight work 


volumnia

thou art my warrior 
i holp to frame thee  do you know this lady 


coriolanus

the noble sister of publicola 
the moon of rome  chaste as the icicle
that curdied by the frost from purest snow
and hangs on dian temple  dear valeria 


volumnia

this is a poor epitome of yours 
which by the interpretation of full time
may show like all yourself 


coriolanus

the god of soldiers 
with the consent of supreme jove  inform
thy thoughts with nobleness  that thou mayst prove
to shame unvulnerable  and stick i  the wars
like a great sea mark  standing every flaw 
and saving those that eye thee 


volumnia

your knee  sirrah 


coriolanus

that my brave boy 


volumnia

even he  your wife  this lady  and myself 
are suitors to you 


coriolanus

i beseech you  peace 
or  if you ask  remember this before 
the thing i have forsworn to grant may never
be held by you denials  do not bid me
dismiss my soldiers  or capitulate
again with rome mechanics  tell me not
wherein i seem unnatural  desire not
to ally my rages and revenges with
your colder reasons 


volumnia

o  no more  no more 
you have said you will not grant us any thing 
for we have nothing else to ask  but that
which you deny already  yet we will ask 
that  if you fail in our request  the blame
may hang upon your hardness  therefore hear us 


coriolanus

aufidius  and you volsces  mark  for we 
hear nought from rome in private  your request 


volumnia

should we be silent and not speak  our raiment
and state of bodies would bewray what life
we have led since thy exile  think with thyself
how more unfortunate than all living women
are we come hither  since that thy sight 
which should
make our eyes flow with joy  hearts dance
with comforts 
constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow 
making the mother  wife and child to see
the son  the husband and the father tearing
his country bowels out  and to poor we
thine enmity most capital  thou barr us
our prayers to the gods  which is a comfort
that all but we enjoy  for how can we 
alas  how can we for our country pray 
whereto we are bound  together with thy victory 
whereto we are bound  alack  or we must lose
the country  our dear nurse  or else thy person 
our comfort in the country  we must find
an evident calamity  though we had
our wish  which side should win  for either thou
must  as a foreign recreant  be led
with manacles thorough our streets  or else
triumphantly tread on thy country ruin 
and bear the palm for having bravely shed
thy wife and children blood  for myself  son 
i purpose not to wait on fortune till
these wars determine  if i cannot persuade thee
rather to show a noble grace to both parts
than seek the end of one  thou shalt no sooner
march to assault thy country than to tread 
trust to t  thou shalt not on thy mother womb 
that brought thee to this world 


virgilia

ay  and mine 
that brought you forth this boy  to keep your name
living to time 


young marcius

a  shall not tread on me 
i run away till i am bigger  but then i fight 


coriolanus

not of a woman tenderness to be 
requires nor child nor woman face to see 
i have sat too long 
rising


volumnia

nay  go not from us thus 
if it were so that our request did tend
to save the romans  thereby to destroy
the volsces whom you serve  you might condemn us 
as poisonous of your honour  no  our suit
is that you reconcile them  while the volsces
may say  mercy we have show d  the romans 
 we received  and each in either side
give the all hail to thee and cry  blest
for making up this peace  thou know st  great son 
the end of war uncertain  but this certain 
that  if thou conquer rome  the benefit
which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name 
whose repetition will be dogg with curses 
whose chronicle thus writ   man was noble 
but with his last attempt he wiped it out 
destroy his country  and his name remains
to the ensuing age abhorr d  speak to me  son 
thou hast affected the fine strains of honour 
to imitate the graces of the gods 
to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o  the air 
and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
that should but rive an oak  why dost not speak 
think thou it honourable for a noble man
still to remember wrongs  daughter  speak you 
he cares not for your weeping  speak thou  boy 
perhaps thy childishness will move him more
than can our reasons  there no man in the world
more bound to  mother  yet here he lets me prate
like one i  the stocks  thou hast never in thy life
show thy dear mother any courtesy 
when she  poor hen  fond of no second brood 
has cluck thee to the wars and safely home 
loaden with honour  say my request unjust 
and spurn me back  but if it be not so 
thou art not honest  and the gods will plague thee 
that thou restrain from me the duty which
to a mother part belongs  he turns away 
down  ladies  let us shame him with our knees 
to his surname coriolanus  more pride
than pity to our prayers  down  an end 
this is the last  so we will home to rome 
and die among our neighbours  nay  behold  s 
this boy  that cannot tell what he would have
but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship 
does reason our petition with more strength
than thou hast to deny  t  come  let us go 
this fellow had a volscian to his mother 
his wife is in corioli and his child
like him by chance  yet give us our dispatch 
i am hush until our city be a fire 
and then i speak a little 
he holds her by the hand  silent


coriolanus

o mother  mother 
what have you done  behold  the heavens do ope 
the gods look down  and this unnatural scene
they laugh at  o my mother  mother  o 
you have won a happy victory to rome 
but  for your son believe it  o  believe it 
most dangerously you have with him prevail d 
if not most mortal to him  but  let it come 
aufidius  though i cannot make true wars 
i frame convenient peace  now  good aufidius 
were you in my stead  would you have heard
a mother less  or granted less  aufidius 


aufidius

i was moved withal 


coriolanus

i dare be sworn you were 
and  sir  it is no little thing to make
mine eyes to sweat compassion  but  good sir 
what peace you make  advise me  for my part 
i not to rome  i back with you  and pray you 
stand to me in this cause  o mother  wife 


aufidius

 aside   i am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
thy honour
at difference in thee  out of that i work
myself a former fortune 
the ladies make signs to coriolanus


coriolanus

ay  by and by 
to volumnia  virgilia     c
but we will drink together  and you shall bear
a better witness back than words  which we 
on like conditions  will have counter seal d 
come  enter with us  ladies  you deserve
to have a temple built you  all the swords
in italy  and her confederate arms 
could not have made this peace 
exeunt
