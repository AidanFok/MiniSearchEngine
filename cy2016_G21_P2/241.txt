scene iv  rome  a public place 


enter menenius and sicinius


menenius

see you yond coign o  the capitol  yond
corner stone 


sicinius

why  what of that 


menenius

if it be possible for you to displace it with your
little finger  there is some hope the ladies of
rome  especially his mother  may prevail with him 
but i say there is no hope in t  our throats are
sentenced and stay upon execution 


sicinius

is possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man 


menenius

there is differency between a grub and a butterfly 
yet your butterfly was a grub  this marcius is grown
from man to dragon  he has wings  he more than a
creeping thing 


sicinius

he loved his mother dearly 


menenius

so did he me  and he no more remembers his mother
now than an eight year old horse  the tartness
of his face sours ripe grapes  when he walks  he
moves like an engine  and the ground shrinks before
his treading  he is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye  talks like a knell  and his hum is a
battery  he sits in his state  as a thing made for
alexander  what he bids be done is finished with
his bidding  he wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in 


sicinius

yes  mercy  if you report him truly 


menenius

i paint him in the character  mark what mercy his
mother shall bring from him  there is no more mercy
in him than there is milk in a male tiger  that
shall our poor city find  and all this is long of
you 


sicinius

the gods be good unto us 


menenius

no  in such a case the gods will not be good unto
us  when we banished him  we respected not them 
and  he returning to break our necks  they respect not us 
enter a messenger


messenger

sir  if you save your life  fly to your house 
the plebeians have got your fellow tribune
and hale him up and down  all swearing  if
the roman ladies bring not comfort home 
they give him death by inches 
enter a second messenger


sicinius

what the news 


second messenger

good news  good news  the ladies have prevail d 
the volscians are dislodged  and marcius gone 
a merrier day did never yet greet rome 
no  not the expulsion of the tarquins 


sicinius

friend 
art thou certain this is true  is it most certain 


second messenger

as certain as i know the sun is fire 
where have you lurk d  that you make doubt of it 
ne through an arch so hurried the blown tide 
as the recomforted through the gates  why  hark you 
trumpets  hautboys  drums beat  all together
the trumpets  sackbuts  psalteries and fifes 
tabours and cymbals and the shouting romans 
make the sun dance  hark you 
a shout within


menenius

this is good news 
i will go meet the ladies  this volumnia
is worth of consuls  senators  patricians 
a city full  of tribunes  such as you 
a sea and land full  you have pray well to day 
this morning for ten thousand of your throats
i not have given a doit  hark  how they joy 
music still  with shouts


sicinius

first  the gods bless you for your tidings  next 
accept my thankfulness 


second messenger

sir  we have all
great cause to give great thanks 


sicinius

they are near the city 


second messenger

almost at point to enter 


sicinius

we will meet them 
and help the joy 
exeunt
