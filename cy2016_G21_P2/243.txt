scene vi  antium  a public place 


enter tullus aufidius  with attendants


aufidius

go tell the lords o  the city i am here 
deliver them this paper  having read it 
bid them repair to the market place  where i 
even in theirs and in the commons  ears 
will vouch the truth of it  him i accuse
the city ports by this hath enter and
intends to appear before the people  hoping
to purge herself with words  dispatch 
exeunt attendants
enter three or four conspirators of aufidius  faction
most welcome 


first conspirator

how is it with our general 


aufidius

even so
as with a man by his own alms empoison d 
and with his charity slain 


second conspirator

most noble sir 
if you do hold the same intent wherein
you wish us parties  we deliver you
of your great danger 


aufidius

sir  i cannot tell 
we must proceed as we do find the people 


third conspirator

the people will remain uncertain whilst
 you there difference  but the fall of either
makes the survivor heir of all 


aufidius

i know it 
and my pretext to strike at him admits
a good construction  i raised him  and i pawn 
mine honour for his truth  who being so heighten d 
he water his new plants with dews of flattery 
seducing so my friends  and  to this end 
he bow his nature  never known before
but to be rough  unswayable and free 


third conspirator

sir  his stoutness
when he did stand for consul  which he lost
by lack of stooping 


aufidius

that i would have spoke of 
being banish for t  he came unto my hearth 
presented to my knife his throat  i took him 
made him joint servant with me  gave him way
in all his own desires  nay  let him choose
out of my files  his projects to accomplish 
my best and freshest men  served his designments
in mine own person  holp to reap the fame
which he did end all his  and took some pride
to do myself this wrong  till  at the last 
i seem his follower  not partner  and
he waged me with his countenance  as if
i had been mercenary 


first conspirator

so he did  my lord 
the army marvell at it  and  in the last 
when he had carried rome and that we look 
for no less spoil than glory 


aufidius

there was it 
for which my sinews shall be stretch upon him 
at a few drops of women rheum  which are
as cheap as lies  he sold the blood and labour
of our great action  therefore shall he die 
and i renew me in his fall  but  hark 
drums and trumpets sound  with great shouts of the people


first conspirator

your native town you enter like a post 
and had no welcomes home  but he returns 
splitting the air with noise 


second conspirator

and patient fools 
whose children he hath slain  their base throats tear
with giving him glory 


third conspirator

therefore  at your vantage 
ere he express himself  or move the people
with what he would say  let him feel your sword 
which we will second  when he lies along 
after your way his tale pronounced shall bury
his reasons with his body 


aufidius

say no more 
here come the lords 
enter the lords of the city


all the lords

you are most welcome home 


aufidius

i have not deserved it 
but  worthy lords  have you with heed perused
what i have written to you 


lords

we have 


first lord

and grieve to hear t 
what faults he made before the last  i think
might have found easy fines  but there to end
where he was to begin and give away
the benefit of our levies  answering us
with our own charge  making a treaty where
there was a yielding this admits no excuse 


aufidius

he approaches  you shall hear him 
enter coriolanus  marching with drum and colours  commoners being with him


coriolanus

hail  lords  i am return your soldier 
no more infected with my country love
than when i parted hence  but still subsisting
under your great command  you are to know
that prosperously i have attempted and
with bloody passage led your wars even to
the gates of rome  our spoils we have brought home
do more than counterpoise a full third part
the charges of the action  we have made peace
with no less honour to the antiates
than shame to the romans  and we here deliver 
subscribed by the consuls and patricians 
together with the seal o  the senate  what
we have compounded on 


aufidius

read it not  noble lords 
but tell the traitor  in the high degree
he hath abused your powers 


coriolanus

traitor  how now 


aufidius

                  ay  traitor  marcius 


coriolanus

marcius 


aufidius

ay  marcius  caius marcius  dost thou think
i grace thee with that robbery  thy stol name
coriolanus in corioli 
you lords and heads o  the state  perfidiously
he has betray your business  and given up 
for certain drops of salt  your city rome 
i say  city  to his wife and mother 
breaking his oath and resolution like
a twist of rotten silk  never admitting
counsel o  the war  but at his nurse tears
he whined and roar away your victory 
that pages blush at him and men of heart
look wondering each at other 


coriolanus

hear thou  mars 


aufidius

name not the god  thou boy of tears 


coriolanus

ha 


aufidius

no more 


coriolanus

measureless liar  thou hast made my heart
too great for what contains it  boy  o slave 
pardon me  lords   the first time that ever
i was forced to scold  your judgments  my grave lords 
must give this cur the lie  and his own notion 
who wears my stripes impress upon him  that
must bear my beating to his grave shall join
to thrust the lie unto him 


first lord

peace  both  and hear me speak 


coriolanus

cut me to pieces  volsces  men and lads 
stain all your edges on me  boy  false hound 
if you have writ your annals true   there 
that  like an eagle in a dove cote  i
flutter your volscians in corioli 
alone i did it  boy 


aufidius

why  noble lords 
will you be put in mind of his blind fortune 
which was your shame  by this unholy braggart 
 your own eyes and ears 


all conspirators

let him die for t 


all the people

 him to pieces   it presently   kill 
my son   daughter   killed my cousin
marcus   killed my father 


second lord

peace  ho  no outrage  peace 
the man is noble and his fame folds in
this orb o  the earth  his last offences to us
shall have judicious hearing  stand  aufidius 
and trouble not the peace 


coriolanus

o that i had him 
with six aufidiuses  or more  his tribe 
to use my lawful sword 


aufidius

insolent villain 


all conspirators

kill  kill  kill  kill  kill him 
the conspirators draw  and kill coriolanus  aufidius stands on his body


lords

hold  hold  hold  hold 


aufidius

my noble masters  hear me speak 


first lord

o tullus 


second lord

thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep 


third lord

tread not upon him  masters all  be quiet 
put up your swords 


aufidius

my lords  when you shall know as in this rage 
provoked by him  you cannot the great danger
which this man life did owe you  you rejoice
that he is thus cut off  please it your honours
to call me to your senate  i deliver
myself your loyal servant  or endure
your heaviest censure 


first lord

bear from hence his body 
and mourn you for him  let him be regarded
as the most noble corse that ever herald
did follow to his urn 


second lord

his own impatience
takes from aufidius a great part of blame 
let make the best of it 


aufidius

my rage is gone 
and i am struck with sorrow  take him up 
help  three o  the chiefest soldiers  i be one 
beat thou the drum  that it speak mournfully 
trail your steel pikes  though in this city he
hath widow and unchilded many a one 
which to this hour bewail the injury 
yet he shall have a noble memory  assist 
exeunt  bearing the body of coriolanus  a dead march sounded
