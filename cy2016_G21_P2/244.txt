scene i  britain  the garden of cymbeline palace 


enter two gentlemen


first gentleman

you do not meet a man but frowns  our bloods
no more obey the heavens than our courtiers
still seem as does the king 


second gentleman

but what the matter 


first gentleman

his daughter  and the heir of kingdom  whom
he purposed to his wife sole son a widow
that late he married hath referr herself
unto a poor but worthy gentleman  she wedded 
her husband banish d  she imprison d  all
is outward sorrow  though i think the king
be touch at very heart 


second gentleman

none but the king 


first gentleman

he that hath lost her too  so is the queen 
that most desired the match  but not a courtier 
although they wear their faces to the bent
of the king look s  hath a heart that is not
glad at the thing they scowl at 


second gentleman

and why so 


first gentleman

he that hath miss the princess is a thing
too bad for bad report  and he that hath her 
i mean  that married her  alack  good man 
and therefore banish d is a creature such
as  to seek through the regions of the earth
for one his like  there would be something failing
in him that should compare  i do not think
so fair an outward and such stuff within
endows a man but he 


second gentleman

you speak him far 


first gentleman

i do extend him  sir  within himself 
crush him together rather than unfold
his measure duly 


second gentleman

                  what his name and birth 


first gentleman

i cannot delve him to the root  his father
was call sicilius  who did join his honour
against the romans with cassibelan 
but had his titles by tenantius whom
he served with glory and admired success 
so gain the sur addition leonatus 
and had  besides this gentleman in question 
two other sons  who in the wars o  the time
died with their swords in hand  for which
their father 
then old and fond of issue  took such sorrow
that he quit being  and his gentle lady 
big of this gentleman our theme  deceased
as he was born  the king he takes the babe
to his protection  calls him posthumus leonatus 
breeds him and makes him of his bed chamber 
puts to him all the learnings that his time
could make him the receiver of  which he took 
as we do air  fast as  minister d 
and in spring became a harvest  lived in court 
which rare it is to do most praised  most loved 
a sample to the youngest  to the more mature
a glass that feated them  and to the graver
a child that guided dotards  to his mistress 
for whom he now is banish d  her own price
proclaims how she esteem him and his virtue 
by her election may be truly read
what kind of man he is 


second gentleman

i honour him
even out of your report  but  pray you  tell me 
is she sole child to the king 


first gentleman

his only child 
he had two sons  if this be worth your hearing 
mark it  the eldest of them at three years old 
i  the swathing clothes the other  from their nursery
were stol n  and to this hour no guess in knowledge
which way they went 


second gentleman

how long is this ago 


first gentleman

some twenty years 


second gentleman

that a king children should be so convey d 
so slackly guarded  and the search so slow 
that could not trace them 


first gentleman

howsoe strange 
or that the negligence may well be laugh at 
yet is it true  sir 


second gentleman

i do well believe you 


first gentleman

we must forbear  here comes the gentleman 
the queen  and princess 
exeunt
enter the queen  posthumus leonatus  and imogen


queen

no  be assured you shall not find me  daughter 
after the slander of most stepmothers 
evil eyed unto you  you my prisoner  but
your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
that lock up your restraint  for you  posthumus 
so soon as i can win the offended king 
i will be known your advocate  marry  yet
the fire of rage is in him  and  good
you lean unto his sentence with what patience
your wisdom may inform you 


posthumus leonatus

please your highness 
i will from hence to day 


queen

you know the peril 
i fetch a turn about the garden  pitying
the pangs of barr affections  though the king
hath charged you should not speak together 
exit


imogen

o
dissembling courtesy  how fine this tyrant
can tickle where she wounds  my dearest husband 
i something fear my father wrath  but nothing 
always reserved my holy duty what
his rage can do on me  you must be gone 
and i shall here abide the hourly shot
of angry eyes  not comforted to live 
but that there is this jewel in the world
that i may see again 


posthumus leonatus

my queen  my mistress 
o lady  weep no more  lest i give cause
to be suspected of more tenderness
than doth become a man  i will remain
the loyal husband that did e plight troth 
my residence in rome at one philario s 
who to my father was a friend  to me
known but by letter  thither write  my queen 
and with mine eyes i drink the words you send 
though ink be made of gall 
re enter queen


queen

be brief  i pray you 
if the king come  i shall incur i know not
how much of his displeasure 
aside
yet i move him
to walk this way  i never do him wrong 
but he does buy my injuries  to be friends 
pays dear for my offences 
exit


posthumus leonatus

should we be taking leave
as long a term as yet we have to live 
the loathness to depart would grow  adieu 


imogen

nay  stay a little 
were you but riding forth to air yourself 
such parting were too petty  look here  love 
this diamond was my mother s  take it  heart 
but keep it till you woo another wife 
when imogen is dead 


posthumus leonatus

how  how  another 
you gentle gods  give me but this i have 
and sear up my embracements from a next
with bonds of death 
putting on the ring
remain  remain thou here
while sense can keep it on  and  sweetest  fairest 
as i my poor self did exchange for you 
to your so infinite loss  so in our trifles
i still win of you  for my sake wear this 
it is a manacle of love  i place it
upon this fairest prisoner 
putting a bracelet upon her arm


imogen

o the gods 
when shall we see again 
enter cymbeline and lords


posthumus leonatus

alack  the king 


cymbeline

thou basest thing  avoid  hence  from my sight 
if after this command thou fraught the court
with thy unworthiness  thou diest  away 
thou poison to my blood 


posthumus leonatus

the gods protect you 
and bless the good remainders of the court  i am gone 
exit


imogen

                  there cannot be a pinch in death
more sharp than this is 


cymbeline

o disloyal thing 
that shouldst repair my youth  thou heap 
a year age on me 


imogen

i beseech you  sir 
harm not yourself with your vexation
i am senseless of your wrath  a touch more rare
subdues all pangs  all fears 


cymbeline

past grace  obedience 


imogen

past hope  and in despair  that way  past grace 


cymbeline

that mightst have had the sole son of my queen 


imogen

o blest  that i might not  i chose an eagle 
and did avoid a puttock 


cymbeline

thou took a beggar  wouldst have made my throne
a seat for baseness 


imogen

no  i rather added
a lustre to it 


cymbeline

                  o thou vile one 


imogen

sir 
it is your fault that i have loved posthumus 
you bred him as my playfellow  and he is
a man worth any woman  overbuys me
almost the sum he pays 


cymbeline

what  art thou mad 


imogen

almost  sir  heaven restore me  would i were
a neat herd daughter  and my leonatus
our neighbour shepherd son 


cymbeline

thou foolish thing 
re enter queen
they were again together  you have done
not after our command  away with her 
and pen her up 


queen

                  beseech your patience  peace 
dear lady daughter  peace  sweet sovereign 
leave us to ourselves  and make yourself some comfort
out of your best advice 


cymbeline

a drop of blood a day  and  being aged 
die of this folly 
exeunt cymbeline and lords

and had no help of anger  they were parted
by gentlemen at hand

imogen

your son my father friend  he takes his part 
to draw upon an exile  o brave sir

the goer back  why came you from your master 


pisanio

on his command  he would not suffer me
to bring him to the haven  left these notes
of what commands i should be subject to 
when  pleased you to employ me
