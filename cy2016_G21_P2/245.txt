scene ii  the same  a public place 


enter cloten and two lords


first lord

sir  i would advise you to shift a shirt  the
violence of action hath made you reek as a
sacrifice  where air comes out  air comes in 
there none abroad so wholesome as that you vent 


cloten

if my shirt were bloody  then to shift it  have i hurt him 


second lord

 aside   no   faith  not so much as his patience 


first lord

hurt him  his body a passable carcass  if he be
not hurt  it is a thoroughfare for steel  if it be not hurt 


second lord

 aside   his steel was in debt  it went o  the
backside the town 


cloten

the villain would not stand me 


second lord

 aside   no  but he fled forward still  toward your face 


first lord

stand you  you have land enough of your own  but
he added to your having  gave you some ground 


second lord

 aside   as many inches as you have oceans  puppies 


cloten

i would they had not come between us 


second lord

 aside   so would i  till you had measured how long
a fool you were upon the ground 


cloten

and that she should love this fellow and refuse me 


second lord

 aside   if it be a sin to make a true election  she
is damned 


first lord

sir  as i told you always  her beauty and her brain
go not together  she a good sign  but i have seen
small reflection of her wit 


second lord

 aside   she shines not upon fools  lest the
reflection should hurt her 


cloten

come  i to my chamber  would there had been some
hurt done 


second lord

 aside   i wish not so  unless it had been the fall
of an ass  which is no great hurt 


cloten

you go with us 


first lord

i attend your lordship 


cloten

nay  come  let go together 


second lord

well  my lord
