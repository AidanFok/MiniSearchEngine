scene iii  a room in cymbeline palace 


enter imogen and pisanio


imogen

i would thou grew unto the shores o  the haven 
and question every sail  if he should write
and not have it   a paper lost 
as offer mercy is  what was the last
that he spake to thee 


pisanio

it was his queen  his queen 


imogen

then waved his handkerchief 


pisanio

and kiss it  madam 


imogen

senseless linen  happier therein than i 
and that was all 


pisanio

                  no  madam  for so long
as he could make me with this eye or ear
distinguish him from others  he did keep
the deck  with glove  or hat  or handkerchief 
still waving  as the fits and stirs of  mind
could best express how slow his soul sail on 
how swift his ship 


imogen

thou shouldst have made him
as little as a crow  or less  ere left
to after eye him 


pisanio

                  madam  so i did 


imogen

i would have broke mine eye strings  crack them  but
to look upon him  till the diminution
of space had pointed him sharp as my needle 
nay  follow him  till he had melted from
the smallness of a gnat to air  and then
have turn mine eye and wept  but  good pisanio 
when shall we hear from him 


pisanio

be assured  madam 
with his next vantage 


imogen

i did not take my leave of him  but had
most pretty things to say  ere i could tell him
how i would think on him at certain hours
such thoughts and such  or i could make him swear
the shes of italy should not betray
mine interest and his honour  or have charged him 
at the sixth hour of morn  at noon  at midnight 
to encounter me with orisons  for then
i am in heaven for him  or ere i could
give him that parting kiss which i had set
betwixt two charming words  comes in my father
and like the tyrannous breathing of the north
shakes all our buds from growing 
enter a lady


lady

the queen  madam 
desires your highness  company 


imogen

those things i bid you do  get them dispatch d 
i will attend the queen 


pisanio

madam  i shall 
exeunt
