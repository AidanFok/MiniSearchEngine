scene v  britain  a room in cymbeline palace 


enter queen  ladies  and cornelius


queen

whiles yet the dew on ground  gather those flowers 
make haste  who has the note of them 


first lady

i  madam 


queen

dispatch 
exeunt ladies
now  master doctor  have you brought those drugs 


cornelius

pleaseth your highness  ay  here they are  madam 
presenting a small box
but i beseech your grace  without offence 
my conscience bids me ask wherefore you have
commanded of me those most poisonous compounds 
which are the movers of a languishing death 
but though slow  deadly 


queen

i wonder  doctor 
thou ask me such a question  have i not been
thy pupil long  hast thou not learn me how
to make perfumes  distil  preserve  yea  so
that our great king himself doth woo me oft
for my confections  having thus far proceeded 
unless thou think me devilish is not meet
that i did amplify my judgment in
other conclusions  i will try the forces
of these thy compounds on such creatures as
we count not worth the hanging  but none human 
to try the vigour of them and apply
allayments to their act  and by them gather
their several virtues and effects 


cornelius

your highness
shall from this practise but make hard your heart 
besides  the seeing these effects will be
both noisome and infectious 


queen

o  content thee 
enter pisanio
aside
here comes a flattering rascal  upon him
will i first work  he for his master 
an enemy to my son  how now  pisanio 
doctor  your service for this time is ended 
take your own way 


cornelius

 aside           i do suspect you  madam 
but you shall do no harm 


queen

 to pisanio             hark thee  a word 


cornelius

 aside   i do not like her  she doth think she has
strange lingering poisons  i do know her spirit 
and will not trust one of her malice with
a drug of such damn nature  those she has
will stupefy and dull the sense awhile 
which first  perchance  she prove on
cats and dogs 
then afterward up higher  but there is
no danger in what show of death it makes 
more than the locking up the spirits a time 
to be more fresh  reviving  she is fool 
with a most false effect  and i the truer 
so to be false with her 


queen

no further service  doctor 
until i send for thee 


cornelius

i humbly take my leave 
exit


queen

weeps she still  say thou  dost thou think in time
she will not quench and let instructions enter
where folly now possesses  do thou work 
when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son 
i tell thee on the instant thou art then
as great as is thy master  greater  for
his fortunes all lie speechless and his name
is at last gasp  return he cannot  nor
continue where he is  to shift his being
is to exchange one misery with another 
and every day that comes comes to decay
a day work in him  what shalt thou expect 
to be depender on a thing that leans 
who cannot be new built  nor has no friends 
so much as but to prop him 
the queen drops the box  pisanio takes it up
thou takest up
thou know not what  but take it for thy labour 
it is a thing i made  which hath the king
five times redeem from death  i do not know
what is more cordial  nay  i prethee  take it 
it is an earnest of a further good
that i mean to thee  tell thy mistress how
the case stands with her  do as from thyself 
think what a chance thou changest on  but think
thou hast thy mistress still  to boot  my son 
who shall take notice of thee  i move the king
to any shape of thy preferment such
as thou desire  and then myself  i chiefly 
that set thee on to this desert  am bound
to load thy merit richly  call my women 
think on my words 
exit pisanio
a sly and constant knave 
not to be shaked  the agent for his master
and the remembrancer of her to hold
the hand fast to her lord  i have given him that
which  if he take  shall quite unpeople her
of liegers for her sweet  and which she after 
except she bend her humour  shall be assured
to taste of too 
re enter pisanio and ladies
so  so  well done  well done 
the violets  cowslips  and the primroses 
bear to my closet  fare thee well  pisanio 
think on my words 
exeunt queen and ladies


pisanio

and shall do 
but when to my good lord i prove untrue 
i choke myself  there all i do for you 
exit
