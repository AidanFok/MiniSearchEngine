a father cruel  and a step dame false 
a foolish suitor to a wedded lady 
that hath her husband banish d o  that husband 
my supreme crown of grief  and those repeated
vexations of it  had i been thief stol n 
as my two brothers  happy  but most miserable
is the desire that glorious  blest be those 
how mean soe er  that have their honest wills 
which seasons comfort  who may this be  fie 
enter pisanio and iachimo


pisanio

madam  a noble gentleman of rome 
comes from my lord with letters 


iachimo

change you  madam 
the worthy leonatus is in safety
and greets your highness dearly 
presents a letter


imogen

thanks  good sir 
you kindly welcome 


iachimo

 aside   all of her that is out of door most rich 
if she be furnish with a mind so rare 
she is alone the arabian bird  and i
have lost the wager  boldness be my friend 
arm me  audacity  from head to foot 
or  like the parthian  i shall flying fight 
rather directly fly 


imogen

 reads    is one of the noblest note  to whose
kindnesses i am most infinitely tied  reflect upon
him accordingly  as you value your trust 
leonatus 
so far i read aloud 
but even the very middle of my heart
is warm by the rest  and takes it thankfully 
you are as welcome  worthy sir  as i
have words to bid you  and shall find it so
in all that i can do 


iachimo

thanks  fairest lady 
what  are men mad  hath nature given them eyes
to see this vaulted arch  and the rich crop
of sea and land  which can distinguish  
the fiery orbs above and the twinn stones
upon the number beach  and can we not
partition make with spectacles so precious
 fair and foul 


imogen

what makes your admiration 


iachimo

it cannot be i  the eye  for apes and monkeys
 two such shes would chatter this way and
contemn with mows the other  nor i  the judgment 
for idiots in this case of favour would
be wisely definite  nor i  the appetite 
sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
should make desire vomit emptiness 
not so allured to feed 


imogen

what is the matter  trow 


iachimo

the cloyed will 
that satiate yet unsatisfied desire  that tub
both fill and running  ravening first the lamb
longs after for the garbage 


imogen

what  dear sir 
thus raps you  are you well 


iachimo

thanks  madam  well 
to pisanio
beseech you  sir  desire
my man abode where i did leave him  he
is strange and peevish 


pisanio

i was going  sir 
to give him welcome 
exit


imogen

continues well my lord  his health  beseech you 


iachimo

well  madam 


imogen

is he disposed to mirth  i hope he is 


iachimo

exceeding pleasant  none a stranger there
so merry and so gamesome  he is call 
the briton reveller 


imogen

when he was here 
he did incline to sadness  and oft times
not knowing why 


iachimo

                  i never saw him sad 
there is a frenchman his companion  one
an eminent monsieur  that  it seems  much loves
a gallian girl at home  he furnaces
the thick sighs from him  whiles the jolly briton 
your lord  i mean laughs from free lungs  cries  o 
can my sides hold  to think that man  who knows
by history  report  or his own proof 
what woman is  yea  what she cannot choose
but must be  will his free hours languish for
assured bondage 


imogen

                  will my lord say so 


iachimo

ay  madam  with his eyes in flood with laughter 
it is a recreation to be by
and hear him mock the frenchman  but  heavens know 
some men are much to blame 


imogen

not he  i hope 


iachimo

not he  but yet heaven bounty towards him might
be used more thankfully  in himself   much 
in you  which i account his beyond all talents 
whilst i am bound to wonder  i am bound
to pity too 


imogen

                  what do you pity  sir 


iachimo

two creatures heartily 


imogen

am i one  sir 
you look on me  what wreck discern you in me
deserves your pity 


iachimo

lamentable  what 
to hide me from the radiant sun and solace
i  the dungeon by a snuff 


imogen

i pray you  sir 
deliver with more openness your answers
to my demands  why do you pity me 


iachimo

that others do 
i was about to say enjoy your but
it is an office of the gods to venge it 
not mine to speak on  t 


imogen

you do seem to know
something of me  or what concerns me  pray you 
since doubling things go ill often hurts more
than to be sure they do  for certainties
either are past remedies  or  timely knowing 
the remedy then born discover to me
what both you spur and stop 


iachimo

had i this cheek
to bathe my lips upon  this hand  whose touch 
whose every touch  would force the feeler soul
to the oath of loyalty  this object  which
takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye 
fixing it only here  should i  damn then 
slaver with lips as common as the stairs
that mount the capitol  join gripes with hands
made hard with hourly falsehood falsehood  as
with labour  then by peeping in an eye
base and unlustrous as the smoky light
that fed with stinking tallow  it were fit
that all the plagues of hell should at one time
encounter such revolt 


imogen

my lord  i fear 
has forgot britain 


iachimo

and himself  not i 
inclined to this intelligence  pronounce
the beggary of his change  but  your graces
that from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
charms this report out 


imogen

let me hear no more 


iachimo

o dearest soul  your cause doth strike my heart
with pity  that doth make me sick  a lady
so fair  and fasten to an empery 
would make the great king double to be partner 
with tomboys hired with that self exhibition
which your own coffers yield  with diseased ventures
that play with all infirmities for gold
which rottenness can lend nature  such boil stuff
as well might poison poison  be revenged 
or she that bore you was no queen  and you
recoil from your great stock 


imogen

revenged 
how should i be revenged  if this be true 
as i have such a heart that both mine ears
must not in haste abuse if it be true 
how should i be revenged 


iachimo

should he make me
live  like diana priest  betwixt cold sheets 
whiles he is vaulting variable ramps 
in your despite  upon your purse  revenge it 
i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure 
more noble than that runagate to your bed 
and will continue fast to your affection 
still close as sure 


imogen

what  ho  pisanio 


iachimo

let me my service tender on your lips 


imogen

away  i do condemn mine ears that have
so long attended thee  if thou wert honourable 
thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue  not
for such an end thou seek st as base as strange 
thou wrong a gentleman  who is as far
from thy report as thou from honour  and
solicit here a lady that disdains
thee and the devil alike  what ho  pisanio 
the king my father shall be made acquainted
of thy assault  if he shall think it fit 
a saucy stranger in his court to mart
as in a romish stew and to expound
his beastly mind to us  he hath a court
he little cares for and a daughter who
he not respects at all  what  ho  pisanio 


iachimo

o happy leonatus  i may say
the credit that thy lady hath of thee
deserves thy trust  and thy most perfect goodness
her assured credit  blessed live you long 
a lady to the worthiest sir that ever
country call his  and you his mistress  only
for the most worthiest fit  give me your pardon 
i have spoke this  to know if your affiance
were deeply rooted  and shall make your lord 
that which he is  new o er  and he is one
the truest manner d  such a holy witch
that he enchants societies into him 
half all men hearts are his 


imogen

you make amends 


iachimo

he sits  men like a descended god 
he hath a kind of honour sets him off 
more than a mortal seeming  be not angry 
most mighty princess  that i have adventured
to try your taking a false report  which hath
honour with confirmation your great judgment
in the election of a sir so rare 
which you know cannot err  the love i bear him
made me to fan you thus  but the gods made you 
unlike all others  chaffless  pray  your pardon 


imogen

all well  sir  take my power i  the court
for yours 


iachimo

my humble thanks  i had almost forgot
to entreat your grace but in a small request 
and yet of moment to  for it concerns
your lord  myself and other noble friends 
are partners in the business 


imogen

pray  what is t 


iachimo

some dozen romans of us and your lord 
the best feather of our wing have mingled sums
to buy a present for the emperor
which i  the factor for the rest  have done
in france   plate of rare device  and jewels
of rich and exquisite form  their values great 
and i am something curious  being strange 
to have them in safe stowage  may it please you
to take them in protection 


imogen

willingly 
and pawn mine honour for their safety  since
my lord hath interest in them  i will keep them
in my bedchamber 


iachimo

attended by my men  i will make bold
to send them to you  only for this night 
i must aboard to morrow 


imogen

o  no  no 


iachimo

yes  i beseech  or i shall short my word
by lengthening my return  from gallia
i cross the seas on purpose and on promise
to see your grace 


imogen

i thank you for your pains 
but not away to morrow 


iachimo

o  i must  madam 
therefore i shall beseech you  if you please
to greet your lord with writing  do to night

to the tender of our present
