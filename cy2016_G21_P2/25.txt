the day begins to break  and night is fled 
whose pitchy mantle over veil the earth 
here sound retreat  and cease our hot pursuit 
retreat sounded


talbot

bring forth the body of old salisbury 
and here advance it in the market place 
the middle centre of this cursed town 
now have i paid my vow unto his soul 
for every drop of blood was drawn from him 
there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight 
and that hereafter ages may behold
what ruin happen in revenge of him 
within their chiefest temple i erect
a tomb  wherein his corpse shall be interr d 
upon the which  that every one may read 
shall be engraved the sack of orleans 
the treacherous manner of his mournful death
and what a terror he had been to france 
but  lords  in all our bloody massacre 
i muse we met not with the dauphin grace 
his new come champion  virtuous joan of arc 
nor any of his false confederates 


bedford

 thought  lord talbot  when the fight began 
roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds 
they did amongst the troops of armed men
leap o the walls for refuge in the field 


burgundy

myself  as far as i could well discern
for smoke and dusky vapours of the night 
am sure i scared the dauphin and his trull 
when arm in arm they both came swiftly running 
like to a pair of loving turtle doves
that could not live asunder day or night 
after that things are set in order here 
we follow them with all the power we have 
enter a messenger


messenger

all hail  my lords  which of this princely train
call ye the warlike talbot  for his acts
so much applauded through the realm of france 


talbot

here is the talbot  who would speak with him 


messenger

the virtuous lady  countess of auvergne 
with modesty admiring thy renown 
by me entreats  great lord  thou wouldst vouchsafe
to visit her poor castle where she lies 
that she may boast she hath beheld the man
whose glory fills the world with loud report 


burgundy

is it even so  nay  then  i see our wars
will turn unto a peaceful comic sport 
when ladies crave to be encounter with 
you may not  my lord  despise her gentle suit 


talbot

ne trust me then  for when a world of men
could not prevail with all their oratory 
yet hath a woman kindness over ruled 
and therefore tell her i return great thanks 
and in submission will attend on her 
will not your honours bear me company 


bedford

no  truly  it is more than manners will 
and i have heard it said  unbidden guests
are often welcomest when they are gone 


talbot

well then  alone  since there no remedy 
i mean to prove this lady courtesy 
come hither  captain 
whispers
you perceive my mind 


captain

i do  my lord  and mean accordingly
