scene i  britain  before cymbeline palace 


enter cloten and two lords


cloten

was there ever man had such luck  when i kissed the
jack  upon an up cast to be hit away  i had a
hundred pound on t  and then a whoreson jackanapes
must take me up for swearing  as if i borrowed mine
oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure 


first lord

what got he by that  you have broke his pate with
your bowl 


second lord

 aside   if his wit had been like him that broke it 
it would have run all out 


cloten

when a gentleman is disposed to swear  it is not for
any standers by to curtail his oaths  ha 


second lord

no my lord 
aside
nor crop the ears of them 


cloten

whoreson dog  i give him satisfaction 
would he had been one of my rank 


second lord

 aside   to have smelt like a fool 


cloten

i am not vexed more at any thing in the earth  a
pox on t  i had rather not be so noble as i am 
they dare not fight with me  because of the queen my
mother  every jack slave hath his bellyful of
fighting  and i must go up and down like a cock that
nobody can match 


second lord

 aside   you are cock and capon too  and you crow 
cock  with your comb on 


cloten

sayest thou 


second lord

it is not fit your lordship should undertake every
companion that you give offence to 


cloten

no  i know that  but it is fit i should commit
offence to my inferiors 


second lord

ay  it is fit for your lordship only 


cloten

why  so i say 


first lord

did you hear of a stranger that come to court to night 


cloten

a stranger  and i not know on t 


second lord

 aside   he a strange fellow himself  and knows it
not 


first lord

there an italian come  and   thought  one of
leonatus  friends 


cloten

leonatus  a banished rascal  and he another 
whatsoever he be  who told you of this stranger 


first lord

one of your lordship pages 


cloten

is it fit i went to look upon him  is there no
derogation in t 


second lord

you cannot derogate  my lord 


cloten

not easily  i think 


second lord

 aside   you are a fool granted  therefore your
issues  being foolish  do not derogate 


cloten

come  i go see this italian  what i have lost
to day at bowls i win to night of him  come  go 


second lord

i attend your lordship 
exeunt cloten and first lord
that such a crafty devil as is his mother
should yield the world this ass  a woman that
bears all down with her brain  and this her son
cannot take two from twenty  for his heart 
and leave eighteen  alas  poor princess 
thou divine imogen  what thou endurest 
betwixt a father by thy step dame govern d 
a mother hourly coining plots  a wooer
more hateful than the foul expulsion is
of thy dear husband  than that horrid act
of the divorce he make  the heavens hold firm
the walls of thy dear honour  keep unshaked
that temple  thy fair mind  that thou mayst stand 
to enjoy thy banish lord and this great land 
exit
