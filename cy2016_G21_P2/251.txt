scene ii  imogen bedchamber in cymbeline palace 


a trunk in one corner of it 
imogen in bed  reading  a lady attending


imogen

who there  my woman helen 


lady

please you  madam


imogen

what hour is it 


lady

                  almost midnight  madam 


imogen

i have read three hours then  mine eyes are weak 
fold down the leaf where i have left  to bed 
take not away the taper  leave it burning 
and if thou canst awake by four o  the clock 
i prithee  call me  sleep hath seized me wholly
exit lady
to your protection i commend me  gods 
from fairies and the tempters of the night
guard me  beseech ye 
sleeps  iachimo comes from the trunk


iachimo

the crickets sing  and man o er labour sense
repairs itself by rest  our tarquin thus
did softly press the rushes  ere he waken 
the chastity he wounded  cytherea 
how bravely thou becomest thy bed  fresh lily 
and whiter than the sheets  that i might touch 
but kiss  one kiss  rubies unparagon d 
how dearly they do t   her breathing that
perfumes the chamber thus  the flame o  the taper
bows toward her  and would under peep her lids 
to see the enclosed lights  now canopied
under these windows  white and azure laced
with blue of heaven own tinct  but my design 
to note the chamber  i will write all down 
such and such pictures  there the window  such
the adornment of her bed  the arras  figures 
why  such and such  and the contents o  the story 
ah  but some natural notes about her body 
above ten thousand meaner moveables
would testify  to enrich mine inventory 
o sleep  thou ape of death  lie dull upon her 
and be her sense but as a monument 
thus in a chapel lying  come off  come off 
taking off her bracelet
as slippery as the gordian knot was hard 
 mine  and this will witness outwardly 
as strongly as the conscience does within 
to the madding of her lord  on her left breast
a mole cinque spotted  like the crimson drops
i  the bottom of a cowslip  here a voucher 
stronger than ever law could make  this secret
will force him think i have pick the lock and ta 
the treasure of her honour  no more  to what end 
why should i write this down  that riveted 
screw to my memory  she hath been reading late
the tale of tereus  here the leaf turn down
where philomel gave up  i have enough 
to the trunk again  and shut the spring of it 
swift  swift  you dragons of the night  that dawning
may bare the raven eye  i lodge in fear 
though this a heavenly angel  hell is here 
clock strikes
one  two  three  time  time 
goes into the trunk  the scene closes


scene iii

an ante chamber adjoining imogen apartments 
enter cloten and lords


first lord

your lordship is the most patient man in loss  the
most coldest that ever turned up ace 


cloten

it would make any man cold to lose 


first lord

but not every man patient after the noble temper of
your lordship  you are most hot and furious when you win 


cloten

winning will put any man into courage  if i could
get this foolish imogen  i should have gold enough 
it almost morning  is not 


first lord

day  my lord 


cloten

i would this music would come  i am advised to give
her music o  mornings  they say it will penetrate 
enter musicians
come on  tune  if you can penetrate her with your
fingering  so  we try with tongue too  if none
will do  let her remain  but i never give o er 
first  a very excellent good conceited thing 
after  a wonderful sweet air  with admirable rich
words to it  and then let her consider 
song
hark  hark  the lark at heaven gate sings 
and phoebus  arise 
his steeds to water at those springs
on chaliced flowers that lies 
and winking mary buds begin
to ope their golden eyes 
with every thing that pretty is 
my lady sweet  arise 
arise  arise 


cloten

so  get you gone  if this penetrate  i will
consider your music the better  if it do not  it is
a vice in her ears  which horse hairs and
calves guts  nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
boot  can never amend 
exeunt musicians


second lord

here comes the king 


cloten

i am glad i was up so late  for that the reason i
was up so early  he cannot choose but take this
service i have done fatherly

cymbeline

the exile of her minion is too new 
she hath not yet forgot him  some more time
must wear the print of his remembrance out 
and then she yours 


queen

you are most bound to the king 
who lets go by no vantages that may
prefer you to his daughter  frame yourself
to orderly soliciting  and be friended
with aptness of the season  make denials
increase your services  so seem as if
you were inspired to do those duties which
you tender to her  that you in all obey her 
save when command to your dismission tends 
and therein you are senseless 


cloten

senseless  not so 
enter a messenger

if i do line one of their hands   gold
which buys admittance  oft it doth  yea  and makes
diana rangers false themselves  yield up
their deer to the stand o  the stealer  and  gold
which makes the true man kill and saves the thief 
nay  sometime hangs both thief and true man  what
can it not do and undo  i will make
one of her women lawyer to me  for

imogen

if you swear still  your recompense is still
that i regard it not 


cloten

imogen

but that you shall not say i yield being silent 
i would not speak  i pray you  spare me   faith

by the very truth of it  i care not for you 
and am so near the lack of charity 
to accuse myself i hate you  which i had rather
you felt than make my boast 


cloten

obedience  which you owe your father  for
the contract you pretend with that base wretch 
one bred of alms and foster with cold dishes 
with scraps o  the court  it is no contract  none 
and though it be allow in meaner parties 
yet who than he more mean to knit their souls 
on whom there is no more dependency
but brats and beggary  in self figured knot 
yet you are curb from that enlargement by
the consequence o  the crown  and must not soil
the precious note of it with a base slave 
a hilding for a livery  a squire cloth 
a pantler  not so eminent 


imogen

profane fellow
wert thou the son of jupiter and no more
but what thou art besides  thou wert too base
to be his groom  thou wert dignified enough 
even to the point of envy  if  made
comparative for your virtues  to be styled
the under hangman of his kingdom  and hated
for being preferred so well 


cloten
