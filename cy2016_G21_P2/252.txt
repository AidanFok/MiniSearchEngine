scene iv  rome  philario house 


enter posthumus and philario


posthumus leonatus

fear it not  sir  i would i were so sure
to win the king as i am bold her honour
will remain hers 


philario

                  what means do you make to him 


posthumus leonatus

not any  but abide the change of time 
quake in the present winter state and wish
that warmer days would come  in these sear hopes 
i barely gratify your love  they failing 
i must die much your debtor 


philario

your very goodness and your company
o all i can do  by this  your king
hath heard of great augustus  caius lucius
will do commission throughly  and i think
he grant the tribute  send the arrearages 
or look upon our romans  whose remembrance
is yet fresh in their grief 


posthumus leonatus

i do believe 
statist though i am none  nor like to be 
that this will prove a war  and you shall hear
the legions now in gallia sooner landed
in our not fearing britain than have tidings
of any penny tribute paid  our countrymen
are men more order than when julius caesar
smiled at their lack of skill  but found
their courage
worthy his frowning at  their discipline 
now mingled with their courages  will make known
to their approvers they are people such
that mend upon the world 
enter iachimo


philario

see  iachimo 


posthumus leonatus

the swiftest harts have posted you by land 
and winds of all the comers kiss your sails 
to make your vessel nimble 


philario

welcome  sir 


posthumus leonatus

i hope the briefness of your answer made
the speediness of your return 


iachimo

your lady
is one of the fairest that i have look upon 


posthumus leonatus

and therewithal the best  or let her beauty
look through a casement to allure false hearts
and be false with them 


iachimo

here are letters for you 


posthumus leonatus

their tenor good  i trust 


iachimo

 very like 


philario

was caius lucius in the britain court
when you were there 


iachimo

he was expected then 
but not approach d 


posthumus leonatus

all is well yet 
sparkles this stone as it was wont  or is not
too dull for your good wearing 


iachimo

if i had lost it 
i should have lost the worth of it in gold 
i make a journey twice as far  to enjoy
a second night of such sweet shortness which
was mine in britain  for the ring is won 


posthumus leonatus

the stone too hard to come by 


iachimo

not a whit 
your lady being so easy 


posthumus leonatus

make not  sir 
your loss your sport  i hope you know that we
must not continue friends 


iachimo

good sir  we must 
if you keep covenant  had i not brought
the knowledge of your mistress home  i grant
we were to question further  but i now
profess myself the winner of her honour 
together with your ring  and not the wronger
of her or you  having proceeded but
by both your wills 


posthumus leonatus

if you can make apparent
that you have tasted her in bed  my hand
and ring is yours  if not  the foul opinion
you had of her pure honour gains or loses
your sword or mine  or masterless leaves both
to who shall find them 


iachimo

sir  my circumstances 
being so near the truth as i will make them 
must first induce you to believe  whose strength
i will confirm with oath  which  i doubt not 
you give me leave to spare  when you shall find
you need it not 


posthumus leonatus

                  proceed 


iachimo

first  her bedchamber 
where  i confess  i slept not  but profess
had that was well worth watching it was hang 
with tapesty of silk and silver  the story
proud cleopatra  when she met her roman 
and cydnus swell above the banks  or for
the press of boats or pride  a piece of work
so bravely done  so rich  that it did strive
in workmanship and value  which i wonder 
could be so rarely and exactly wrought 
since the true life on was 


posthumus leonatus

this is true 
and this you might have heard of here  by me 
or by some other 


iachimo

more particulars
must justify my knowledge 


posthumus leonatus

so they must 
or do your honour injury 


iachimo

the chimney
is south the chamber  and the chimney piece
chaste dian bathing  never saw i figures
so likely to report themselves  the cutter
was as another nature  dumb  outwent her 
motion and breath left out 


posthumus leonatus

this is a thing
which you might from relation likewise reap 
being  as it is  much spoke of 


iachimo

the roof o  the chamber
with golden cherubins is fretted  her andirons 
i had forgot them were two winking cupids
of silver  each on one foot standing  nicely
depending on their brands 


posthumus leonatus

this is her honour 
let it be granted you have seen all this and praise
be given to your remembrance the description
of what is in her chamber nothing saves
the wager you have laid 


iachimo

then  if you can 
showing the bracelet
be pale  i beg but leave to air this jewel  see 
and now  up again  it must be married
to that your diamond  i keep them 


posthumus leonatus

jove 
once more let me behold it  is it that
which i left with her 


iachimo

sir i thank her that 
she stripp it from her arm  i see her yet 
her pretty action did outsell her gift 
and yet enrich it too  she gave it me  and said
she prized it once 


posthumus leonatus

may be she pluck it off
to send it me 


iachimo

she writes so to you  doth she 


posthumus leonatus

o  no  no  no   true  here  take this too 
gives the ring
it is a basilisk unto mine eye 
kills me to look on t  let there be no honour
where there is beauty  truth  where semblance  love 
where there another man  the vows of women
of no more bondage be  to where they are made 
than they are to their virtues  which is nothing 
o  above measure false 


philario

have patience  sir 
and take your ring again   not yet won 
it may be probable she lost it  or
who knows if one of her women  being corrupted 
hath stol it from her 


posthumus leonatus

very true 
and so  i hope  he came by t  back my ring 
render to me some corporal sign about her 
more evident than this  for this was stolen 


iachimo

by jupiter  i had it from her arm 


posthumus leonatus

hark you  he swears  by jupiter he swears 
 true nay  keep the ring true  i am sure
she would not lose it  her attendants are
all sworn and honourable they induced to steal it 
and by a stranger no  he hath enjoyed her 
the cognizance of her incontinency
is this  she hath bought the name of whore
thus dearly 
there  take thy hire  and all the fiends of hell
divide themselves between you 


philario

sir  be patient 
this is not strong enough to be believed
of one persuaded well of 


posthumus leonatus

never talk on t 
she hath been colted by him 


iachimo

if you seek
for further satisfying  under her breast 
worthy the pressing lies a mole  right proud
of that most delicate lodging  by my life 
i kiss it  and it gave me present hunger
to feed again  though full  you do remember
this stain upon her 


posthumus leonatus

ay  and it doth confirm
another stain  as big as hell can hold 
were there no more but it 


iachimo

will you hear more 


posthumus leonatus

spare your arithmetic  never count the turns 
once  and a million 


iachimo

i be sworn 


posthumus leonatus

no swearing 
if you will swear you have not done t  you lie 
and i will kill thee  if thou dost deny
thou made me cuckold 


iachimo

i deny nothing 


posthumus leonatus

o  that i had her here  to tear her limb meal 
i will go there and do t  i  the court  before
her father  i do something 
exit


philario

quite besides
the government of patience  you have won 
let follow him  and pervert the present wrath
he hath against himself 


iachimo

with an my heart 
exeunt
