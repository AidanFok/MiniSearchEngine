posthumus leonatus

is there no way for men to be but women
must be half workers  we are all bastards 
and that most venerable man which i
did call my father  was i know not where
when i was stamp d  some coiner with his tools
made me a counterfeit  yet my mother seem 
the dian of that time so doth my wife
the nonpareil of this  o  vengeance  vengeance 
me of my lawful pleasure she restrain 
and pray me oft forbearance  did it with
a pudency so rosy the sweet view on 
might well have warm old saturn  that i thought her
as chaste as unsunn snow  o  all the devils 
this yellow iachimo  in an hour wast not 
or less at first perchance he spoke not  but 
like a full acorn boar  a german one 
cried  o  and mounted  found no opposition
but what he look for should oppose and she
should from encounter guard  could i find out
the woman part in me  for there no motion
that tends to vice in man  but i affirm
it is the woman part  be it lying  note it 
the woman s  flattering  hers  deceiving  hers 
lust and rank thoughts  hers  hers  revenges  hers 
ambitions  covetings  change of prides  disdain 
nice longing  slanders  mutability 
all faults that may be named  nay  that hell knows 
why  hers  in part or all  but rather  all 
for even to vice
they are not constant but are changing still
one vice  but of a minute old  for one
not half so old as that  i write against them 
detest them  curse them  yet  greater skill
in a true hate  to pray they have their will 
the very devils cannot plague them better
