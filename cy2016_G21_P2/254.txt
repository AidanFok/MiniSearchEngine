scene i  britain  a hall in cymbeline palace 


enter in state  cymbeline  queen  cloten   and lords at one door  and at another  caius lucius and attendants


cymbeline

now say  what would augustus caesar with us 


caius lucius

when julius caesar  whose remembrance yet
lives in men eyes and will to ears and tongues
be theme and hearing ever  was in this britain
and conquer it  cassibelan  thine uncle 
famous in caesar praises  no whit less
than in his feats deserving it for him
and his succession granted rome a tribute 
yearly three thousand pounds  which by thee lately
is left untender d 


queen

and  to kill the marvel 
shall be so ever 


cloten

there be many caesars 
ere such another julius  britain is
a world by itself  and we will nothing pay
for wearing our own noses 


queen

that opportunity
which then they had to take from  s  to resume
we have again  remember  sir  my liege 
the kings your ancestors  together with
the natural bravery of your isle  which stands
as neptune park  ribbed and paled in
with rocks unscalable and roaring waters 
with sands that will not bear your enemies  boats 
but suck them up to the topmast  a kind of conquest
caesar made here  but made not here his brag
of  came  and  saw  and  overcame    with shame 
that first that ever touch him he was carried
from off our coast  twice beaten  and his shipping 
poor ignorant baubles  upon our terrible seas 
like egg shells moved upon their surges  crack 
as easily  our rocks  for joy whereof
the famed cassibelan  who was once at point 
o giglot fortune to master caesar sword 
made lud town with rejoicing fires bright
and britons strut with courage 


cloten

come  there no more tribute to be paid  our
kingdom is stronger than it was at that time  and 
as i said  there is no moe such caesars  other of
them may have crook noses  but to owe such
straight arms  none 


cymbeline

son  let your mother end 


cloten

we have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
cassibelan  i do not say i am one  but i have a
hand  why tribute  why should we pay tribute  if
caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket  or
put the moon in his pocket  we will pay him tribute
for light  else  sir  no more tribute  pray you now 


cymbeline

you must know 
till the injurious romans did extort
this tribute from us  we were free 
caesar ambition 
which swell so much that it did almost stretch
the sides o  the world  against all colour here
did put the yoke upon  s  which to shake off
becomes a warlike people  whom we reckon
ourselves to be 


cloten

lords

we do 


cymbeline

say  then  to caesar 
our ancestor was that mulmutius which
ordain our laws  whose use the sword of caesar
hath too much mangled  whose repair and franchise
shall  by the power we hold  be our good deed 
though rome be therefore angry  mulmutius made our laws 
who was the first of britain which did put
his brows within a golden crown and call 
himself a king 


caius lucius

                  i am sorry  cymbeline 
that i am to pronounce augustus caesar 
caesar  that hath more kings his servants than
thyself domestic officers thine enemy 
receive it from me  then  war and confusion
in caesar name pronounce i  thee  look
for fury not to be resisted  thus defied 
i thank thee for myself 


cymbeline

thou art welcome  caius 
thy caesar knighted me  my youth i spent
much under him  of him i gather honour 
which he to seek of me again  perforce 
behoves me keep at utterance  i am perfect
that the pannonians and dalmatians for
their liberties are now in arms  a precedent
which not to read would show the britons cold 
so caesar shall not find them 


caius lucius

let proof speak 


cloten

his majesty bids you welcome  make
pastime with us a day or two  or longer  if
you seek us afterwards in other terms  you
shall find us in our salt water girdle  if you
beat us out of it  it is yours  if you fall in
the adventure  our crows shall fare the better
for you  and there an end 


caius lucius

so  sir 


cymbeline

i know your master pleasure and he mine 
all the remain is  welcome 
exeunt
