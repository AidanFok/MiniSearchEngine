how  of adultery  wherefore write you not
what monster her accuser  leonatus 
o master  what a strange infection
is fall into thy ear  what false italian 
as poisonous tongued as handed  hath prevail 
on thy too ready hearing  disloyal  no 
she punish for her truth  and undergoes 
more goddess like than wife like  such assaults
as would take in some virtue  o my master 
thy mind to her is now as low as were
thy fortunes  how  that i should murder her 
upon the love and truth and vows which i
have made to thy command  i  her  her blood 
if it be so to do good service  never
let me be counted serviceable  how look i 
that i should seem to lack humanity
so much as this fact comes to 
reading
 do t  the letter
that i have sent her  by her own command
shall give thee opportunity  o damn paper 
black as the ink that on thee  senseless bauble 
art thou a feodary for this act  and look 
so virgin like without  lo  here she comes 
i am ignorant in what i am commanded

pisanio

madam  here is a letter from my lord 


imogen

who  thy lord  that is my lord  leonatus 
o  learn indeed were that astronomer
that knew the stars as i his characters 
he lay the future open  you good gods 
let what is here contain relish of love 
of my lord health  of his content  yet not
that we two are asunder  let that grieve him 
some griefs are med cinable  that is one of them 
for it doth physic love  of his content 
all but in that  good wax  thy leave  blest be
you bees that make these locks of counsel  lovers
and men in dangerous bonds pray not alike 
though forfeiters you cast in prison  yet
you clasp young cupid tables  good news  gods 
reads
 justice  and your father wrath  should he take me
in his dominion  could not be so cruel to me  as
you  o the dearest of creatures  would even renew me
with your eyes  take notice that i am in cambria 
at milford haven  what your own love will out of
this advise you  follow  so he wishes you all
happiness  that remains loyal to his vow  and your 
increasing in love 
leonatus posthumus 
o  for a horse with wings  hear thou  pisanio 
he is at milford haven  read  and tell me
how far  thither  if one of mean affairs
may plod it in a week  why may not i
glide thither in a day  then  true pisanio 
who long st  like me  to see thy lord  who long st 
let me bate but not like me yet long st 
but in a fainter kind o  not like me 
for mine beyond beyond say  and speak thick 
love counsellor should fill the bores of hearing 
to the smothering of the sense how far it is
to this same blessed milford  and by the way
tell me how wales was made so happy as
to inherit such a haven  but first of all 
how we may steal from hence  and for the gap
that we shall make in time  from our hence going
and our return  to excuse  but first  how get hence 
why should excuse be born or e begot 
we talk of that hereafter  prithee  speak 
how many score of miles may we well ride
 hour and hour 


pisanio

one score  sun and sun 
madam   enough for you 
aside
and too much too 


imogen

why  one that rode to execution  man 
could never go so slow  i have heard of
riding wagers 
where horses have been nimbler than the sands
that run i  the clock behalf  but this is foolery 
go bid my woman feign a sickness  say
she home to her father  and provide me presently
a riding suit  no costlier than would fit
a franklin housewife 


pisanio

madam  you best consider 


imogen

i see before me  man  nor here  nor here 
nor what ensues  but have a fog in them 
that i cannot look through  away  i prithee 
do as i bid thee  there no more to say 
accessible is none but milford way
