scene iv  country near milford haven 


enter pisanio and imogen


imogen

thou told me  when we came from horse  the place
was near at hand  ne long my mother so
to see me first  as i have now  pisanio  man 
where is posthumus  what is in thy mind 
that makes thee stare thus  wherefore breaks that sigh
from the inward of thee  one  but painted thus 
would be interpreted a thing perplex 
beyond self explication  put thyself
into a havior of less fear  ere wildness
vanquish my staider senses  what the matter 
why tender thou that paper to me  with
a look untender  if be summer news 
smile to before  if winterly  thou need 
but keep that countenance still  my husband hand 
that drug damn italy hath out craftied him 
and he at some hard point  speak  man  thy tongue
may take off some extremity  which to read
would be even mortal to me 


pisanio

please you  read 
and you shall find me  wretched man  a thing
the most disdain of fortune 


imogen

 reads    mistress  pisanio  hath played the
strumpet in my bed  the testimonies whereof lie
bleeding in me  i speak not out of weak surmises 
but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
as i expect my revenge  that part thou  pisanio 
must act for me  if thy faith be not tainted with
the breach of hers  let thine own hands take away
her life  i shall give thee opportunity at
milford haven  she hath my letter for the purpose
where  if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
it is done  thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
equally to me disloyal 


pisanio

what shall i need to draw my sword  the paper
hath cut her throat already  no   slander 
whose edge is sharper than the sword  whose tongue
outvenoms all the worms of nile  whose breath
rides on the posting winds and doth belie
all corners of the world  kings  queens and states 
maids  matrons  nay  the secrets of the grave
this viperous slander enters  what cheer  madam 


imogen

false to his bed  what is it to be false 
to lie in watch there and to think on him 
to weep  clock and clock  if sleep
charge nature 
to break it with a fearful dream of him
and cry myself awake  that false to bed  is it 


pisanio

alas  good lady 


imogen

i false  thy conscience witness  iachimo 
thou didst accuse him of incontinency 
thou then look like a villain  now methinks
thy favour good enough  some jay of italy
whose mother was her painting  hath betray him 
poor i am stale  a garment out of fashion 
and  for i am richer than to hang by the walls 
i must be ripp d to pieces with me o 
men vows are women traitors  all good seeming 
by thy revolt  o husband  shall be thought
put on for villany  not born where grows 
but worn a bait for ladies 


pisanio

good madam  hear me 


imogen

true honest men being heard  like false aeneas 
were in his time thought false  and sinon weeping
did scandal many a holy tear  took pity
from most true wretchedness  so thou  posthumus 
wilt lay the leaven on all proper men 
goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
from thy great fall  come  fellow  be thou honest 
do thou thy master bidding  when thou see him 
a little witness my obedience  look 
i draw the sword myself  take it  and hit
the innocent mansion of my love  my heart 
fear not   empty of all things but grief 
thy master is not there  who was indeed
the riches of it  do his bidding  strike
thou mayst be valiant in a better cause 
but now thou seem a coward 


pisanio

hence  vile instrument 
thou shalt not damn my hand 


imogen

why  i must die 
and if i do not by thy hand  thou art
no servant of thy master s  against self slaughter
there is a prohibition so divine
that cravens my weak hand  come  here my heart 
something afore t  soft  soft  we no defence 
obedient as the scabbard  what is here 
the scriptures of the loyal leonatus 
all turn to heresy  away  away 
corrupters of my faith  you shall no more
be stomachers to my heart  thus may poor fools
believe false teachers  though those that
are betray 
do feel the treason sharply  yet the traitor
stands in worse case of woe 
and thou  posthumus  thou that didst set up
my disobedience  the king my father
and make me put into contempt the suits
of princely fellows  shalt hereafter find
it is no act of common passage  but
a strain of rareness  and i grieve myself
to think  when thou shalt be disedged by her
that now thou tirest on  how thy memory
will then be pang by me  prithee  dispatch 
the lamb entreats the butcher  where thy knife 
thou art too slow to do thy master bidding 
when i desire it too 


pisanio

o gracious lady 
since i received command to do this business
i have not slept one wink 


imogen

do t  and to bed then 


pisanio

i wake mine eye balls blind first 


imogen

wherefore then
didst undertake it  why hast thou abused
so many miles with a pretence  this place 
mine action and thine own  our horses  labour 
the time inviting thee  the perturb court 
for my being absent  whereunto i never
purpose return  why hast thou gone so far 
to be unbent when thou hast ta thy stand 
the elected deer before thee 


pisanio

but to win time
to lose so bad employment  in the which
i have consider of a course  good lady 
hear me with patience 


imogen

talk thy tongue weary  speak
i have heard i am a strumpet  and mine ear
therein false struck  can take no greater wound 
nor tent to bottom that  but speak 


pisanio

then  madam 
i thought you would not back again 


imogen

most like 
bringing me here to kill me 


pisanio

not so  neither 
but if i were as wise as honest  then
my purpose would prove well  it cannot be
but that my master is abused 
some villain  ay  and singular in his art 
hath done you both this cursed injury 


imogen

some roman courtezan 


pisanio

no  on my life 
i give but notice you are dead and send him
some bloody sign of it  for  commanded
i should do so  you shall be miss at court 
and that will well confirm it 


imogen

why good fellow 
what shall i do the where  where bide  how live 
or in my life what comfort  when i am
dead to my husband 


pisanio

if you back to the court 


imogen

no court  no father  nor no more ado
with that harsh  noble  simple nothing 
that cloten  whose love suit hath been to me
as fearful as a siege 


pisanio

if not at court 
then not in britain must you bide 


imogen

where then
hath britain all the sun that shines  day  night 
are they not but in britain  i  the world volume
our britain seems as of it  but not in  t 
in a great pool a swan nest  prithee  think
there livers out of britain 


pisanio

i am most glad
you think of other place  the ambassador 
lucius the roman  comes to milford haven
to morrow  now  if you could wear a mind
dark as your fortune is  and but disguise
that which  to appear itself  must not yet be
but by self danger  you should tread a course
pretty and full of view  yea  haply  near
the residence of posthumus  so nigh at least
that though his actions were not visible  yet
report should render him hourly to your ear
as truly as he moves 


imogen

o  for such means 
though peril to my modesty  not death on t 
i would adventure 


pisanio

well  then  here the point 
you must forget to be a woman  change
command into obedience  fear and niceness 
the handmaids of all women  or  more truly 
woman its pretty self into a waggish courage 
ready in gibes  quick answer d  saucy and
as quarrelous as the weasel  nay  you must
forget that rarest treasure of your cheek 
exposing it but  o  the harder heart 
alack  no remedy to the greedy touch
of common kissing titan  and forget
your laboursome and dainty trims  wherein
you made great juno angry 


imogen

nay  be brief
i see into thy end  and am almost
a man already 


pisanio

first  make yourself but like one 
fore thinking this  i have already fit 
 in my cloak bag doublet  hat  hose  all
that answer to them  would you in their serving 
and with what imitation you can borrow
from youth of such a season   noble lucius
present yourself  desire his service  tell him
wherein you happy which you make him know 
if that his head have ear in music doubtless
with joy he will embrace you  for he honourable
and doubling that  most holy  your means abroad 
you have me  rich  and i will never fail
beginning nor supplyment 


imogen

thou art all the comfort
the gods will diet me with  prithee  away 
there more to be consider d  but we even
all that good time will give us  this attempt
i am soldier to  and will abide it with
a prince courage  away  i prithee 


pisanio

well  madam  we must take a short farewell 
lest  being miss d  i be suspected of
your carriage from the court  my noble mistress 
here is a box  i had it from the queen 
what in is precious  if you are sick at sea 
or stomach qualm at land  a dram of this
will drive away distemper  to some shade 
and fit you to your manhood  may the gods
direct you to the best 


imogen

amen  i thank thee 
exeunt  severally
