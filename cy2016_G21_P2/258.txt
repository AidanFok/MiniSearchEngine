cymbeline

our expectation that it would be thus
hath made us forward  but  my gentle queen 
where is our daughter  she hath not appear 
before the roman  nor to us hath tender 
the duty of the day  she looks us like
a thing more made of malice than of duty 
we have noted it  call her before us  for
we have been too slight in sufferance 
exit an attendant


queen

royal sir 
since the exile of posthumus  most retired
hath her life been  the cure whereof  my lord 
 time must do  beseech your majesty 
forbear sharp speeches to her  she a lady
so tender of rebukes that words are strokes
and strokes death to her 
re enter attendant


cymbeline

where is she  sir  how
can her contempt be answer d 


attendant

please you  sir 
her chambers are all lock d  and there no answer
that will be given to the loudest noise we make 


queen

my lord  when last i went to visit her 
she pray me to excuse her keeping close 
whereto constrain by her infirmity 
she should that duty leave unpaid to you 
which daily she was bound to proffer  this
she wish me to make known  but our great court
made me to blame in memory 


cymbeline

her doors lock d 
not seen of late  grant  heavens  that which i fear
prove false

cloten

that man of hers  pisanio  her old servant 
have not seen these two days 


queen

go  look after 
exit cloten
pisanio  thou that stand so for posthumus 
he hath a drug of mine  i pray his absence
proceed by swallowing that  for he believes
it is a thing most precious  but for her 
where is she gone  haply  despair hath seized her 
or  wing with fervor of her love  she flown
to her desired posthumus  gone she is
to death or to dishonour  and my end
can make good use of either  she being down 
i have the placing of the british crown 
re enter cloten
how now  my son 


cloten

 certain she is fled 
go in and cheer the king  he rages  none
dare come about him 


queen

 aside             all the better  may
this night forestall him of the coming day 
exit


cloten

i love and hate her  for she fair and royal 
and that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
than lady  ladies  woman  from every one
the best she hath  and she  of all compounded 
outsells them all  i love her therefore  but
disdaining me and throwing favours on
the low posthumus slanders so her judgment
that what else rare is choked  and in that point
i will conclude to hate her  nay  indeed 
to be revenged upon her  for when fools shall 
enter pisanio
who is here  what  are you packing  sirrah 
come hither  ah  you precious pander  villain 
where is thy lady  in a word  or else
thou art straightway with the fiends 


pisanio

o  good my lord 


cloten

where is thy lady  or  by jupiter 
i will not ask again  close villain 
i have this secret from thy heart  or rip
thy heart to find it  is she with posthumus 
from whose so many weights of baseness cannot
a dram of worth be drawn 


pisanio

alas  my lord 
how can she be with him  when was she missed 
he is in rome 


cloten

                  where is she  sir  come nearer 
no further halting  satisfy me home
what is become of her 


pisanio

o  my all worthy lord 


cloten

all worthy villain 
discover where thy mistress is at once 
at the next word  no more of  lord 
speak  or thy silence on the instant is
thy condemnation and thy death 


pisanio

then  sir 
this paper is the history of my knowledge
touching her flight 
presenting a letter


cloten

let see t  i will pursue her
even to augustus  throne 


pisanio

 aside                  or this  or perish 
she far enough  and what he learns by this
may prove his travel  not her danger 


cloten

hum 


pisanio

 aside   i write to my lord she dead  o imogen 
safe mayst thou wander  safe return again 


cloten

sirrah  is this letter true 


pisanio

sir  as i think 


cloten

it is posthumus  hand  i know t  sirrah  if thou
wouldst not be a villain  but do me true service 
undergo those employments wherein i should have
cause to use thee with a serious industry  that is 
what villany soe i bid thee do  to perform it
directly and truly  i would think thee an honest
man  thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
relief nor my voice for thy preferment 


pisanio

well  my good lord 


cloten

wilt thou serve me  for since patiently and
constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
that beggar posthumus  thou canst not  in the
course of gratitude  but be a diligent follower of
mine  wilt thou serve me 


pisanio

sir  i will 


cloten

give me thy hand  here my purse  hast any of thy
late master garments in thy possession 


pisanio

i have  my lord  at my lodging  the same suit he
wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress 


cloten

the first service thou dost me  fetch that suit
hither  let it be thy lint service  go 


pisanio

i shall  my lord 
exit


cloten

meet thee at milford haven i forgot to ask him one
thing  i remember anon even there  thou
villain posthumus  will i kill thee  i would these
garments were come  she said upon a time the
bitterness of it i now belch from my heart that she
held the very garment of posthumus in more respect
than my noble and natural person together with the
adornment of my qualities  with that suit upon my
back  will i ravish her  first kill him  and in her
eyes  there shall she see my valour  which will then
be a torment to her contempt  he on the ground  my
speech of insultment ended on his dead body  and
when my lust hath dined which  as i say  to vex
her i will execute in the clothes that she so
praised to the court i knock her back  foot
her home again  she hath despised me rejoicingly 
and i be merry in my revenge 
re enter pisanio  with the clothes
be those the garments 


pisanio

ay  my noble lord 


cloten

how long is since she went to milford haven 


pisanio

she can scarce be there yet 


cloten

bring this apparel to my chamber  that is the second
thing that i have commanded thee  the third is 
that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design  be
but duteous  and true preferment shall tender itself
to thee  my revenge is now at milford  would i had
wings to follow it  come  and be true 
exit


pisanio

thou bid me to my loss  for true to thee
were to prove false  which i will never be 
to him that is most true  to milford go 
and find not her whom thou pursuest  flow  flow 
you heavenly blessings  on her  this fool speed
be cross with slowness  labour be his meed 
exit
