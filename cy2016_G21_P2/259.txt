i see a man life is a tedious one 
i have tired myself  and for two nights together
have made the ground my bed  i should be sick 
but that my resolution helps me  milford 
when from the mountain top pisanio show thee 
thou wast within a ken  o jove  i think
foundations fly the wretched  such  i mean 
where they should be relieved  two beggars told me
i could not miss my way  will poor folks lie 
that have afflictions on them  knowing  
a punishment or trial  yes  no wonder 
when rich ones scarce tell true  to lapse in fulness
is sorer than to lie for need  and falsehood
is worse in kings than beggars  my dear lord 
thou art one o  the false ones  now i think on thee 
my hunger gone  but even before  i was
at point to sink for food  but what is this 
here is a path to t   some savage hold 
i were best not to call  i dare not call 
yet famine 
ere clean it o nature  makes it valiant 
plenty and peace breeds cowards  hardness ever
of hardiness is mother  ho  who here 
if any thing that civil  speak  if savage 
take or lend  ho  no answer  then i enter 
best draw my sword  and if mine enemy
but fear the sword like me  he scarcely look on t 
such a foe  good heavens
