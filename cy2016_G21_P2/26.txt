scene iii  auvergne  the countess castle 


enter the countess and her porter


countess


of auvergne

porter  remember what i gave in charge 
and when you have done so  bring the keys to me 


porter

madam  i will 
exit
countess


of auvergne

the plot is laid  if all things fall out right 
i shall as famous be by this exploit
as scythian tomyris by cyrus  death 
great is the rumor of this dreadful knight 
and his achievements of no less account 
fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears 
to give their censure of these rare reports 
enter messenger and talbot


messenger

madam 
according as your ladyship desired 
by message craved  so is lord talbot come 
countess


of auvergne

and he is welcome  what  is this the man 


messenger

madam  it is 
countess


of auvergne

                  is this the scourge of france 
is this the talbot  so much fear abroad
that with his name the mothers still their babes 
i see report is fabulous and false 
i thought i should have seen some hercules 
a second hector  for his grim aspect 
and large proportion of his strong knit limbs 
alas  this is a child  a silly dwarf 
it cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
should strike such terror to his enemies 


talbot

madam  i have been bold to trouble you 
but since your ladyship is not at leisure 
i sort some other time to visit you 
countess


of auvergne

what means he now  go ask him whither he goes 


messenger

stay  my lord talbot  for my lady craves
to know the cause of your abrupt departure 


talbot

marry  for that she in a wrong belief 
i go to certify her talbot here 
re enter porter with keys
countess


of auvergne

if thou be he  then art thou prisoner 


talbot

prisoner  to whom 
countess


of auvergne

to me  blood thirsty lord 
and for that cause i trained thee to my house 
long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me 
for in my gallery thy picture hangs 
but now the substance shall endure the like 
and i will chain these legs and arms of thine 
that hast by tyranny these many years
wasted our country  slain our citizens
and sent our sons and husbands captivate 


talbot

ha  ha  ha 
countess


of auvergne

laughest thou  wretch  thy mirth shall turn to moan 


talbot

i laugh to see your ladyship so fond
to think that you have aught but talbot shadow
whereon to practise your severity 
countess


of auvergne

why  art not thou the man 


talbot

i am indeed 
countess


of auvergne

then have i substance too 


talbot

no  no  i am but shadow of myself 
you are deceived  my substance is not here 
for what you see is but the smallest part
and least proportion of humanity 
i tell you  madam  were the whole frame here 
it is of such a spacious lofty pitch 
your roof were not sufficient to contain t 
countess


of auvergne

this is a riddling merchant for the nonce 
he will be here  and yet he is not here 
how can these contrarieties agree 


talbot

that will i show you presently 
winds his horn  drums strike up  a peal of ordnance  enter soldiers
how say you  madam  are you now persuaded
that talbot is but shadow of himself 
these are his substance  sinews  arms and strength 
with which he yoketh your rebellious necks 
razeth your cities and subverts your towns
and in a moment makes them desolate 
countess


of auvergne

victorious talbot  pardon my abuse 
i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
and more than may be gather by thy shape 
let my presumption not provoke thy wrath 
for i am sorry that with reverence
i did not entertain thee as thou art 


talbot

be not dismay d  fair lady  nor misconstrue
the mind of talbot  as you did mistake
the outward composition of his body 
what you have done hath not offended me 
nor other satisfaction do i crave 
but only  with your patience  that we may
taste of your wine and see what cates you have 
for soldiers  stomachs always serve them well 
countess


of auvergne

with all my heart  and think me honoured
to feast so great a warrior in my house
