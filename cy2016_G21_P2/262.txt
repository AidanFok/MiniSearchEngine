arviragus

 to imogen 	brother  stay here

imogen

so man and man should be 
but clay and clay differs in dignity 
whose dust is both alike  i am very sick 


guiderius

go you to hunting  i abide with him 


imogen

so sick i am not  yet i am not well 
but not so citizen a wanton as
to seem to die ere sick  so please you  leave me 
stick to your journal course  the breach of custom
is breach of all  i am ill  but your being by me
cannot amend me  society is no comfort
to one not sociable  i am not very sick 
since i can reason of it  pray you  trust me here 
i rob none but myself  and let me die 
stealing so poorly 


guiderius

i love thee  i have spoke it
how much the quantity  the weight as much 
as i do love my father 


belarius

what  how  how 


arviragus

if it be sin to say so  i yoke me
in my good brother fault  i know not why
i love this youth  and i have heard you say 
love reason without reason  the bier at door 
and a demand who is shall die  i say
 father  not this youth 


belarius

 aside 	o noble strain 
o worthiness of nature  breed of greatness 
cowards father cowards and base things sire base 
nature hath meal and bran  contempt and grace 
i not their father  yet who this should be 
doth miracle itself  loved before me 
 the ninth hour o  the morn 


arviragus

brother  farewell 


imogen

i wish ye sport 


arviragus

                  you health  so please you  sir 


imogen

 aside   these are kind creatures  gods  what lies
i have heard 
our courtiers say all savage but at court 
experience  o  thou disprovest report 
the imperious seas breed monsters  for the dish
poor tributary rivers as sweet fish 
i am sick still  heart sick  pisanio 
i now taste of thy drug 
swallows some


guiderius

i could not stir him 
he said he was gentle  but unfortunate 
dishonestly afflicted  but yet honest 


arviragus

thus did he answer me  yet said  hereafter
i might know more 


belarius

to the field  to the field 
we leave you for this time  go in and rest 


arviragus

we not be long away 


belarius

pray  be not sick 
for you must be our housewife 


imogen

well or ill 
i am bound to you 


belarius

and shalt be ever 
exit imogen  to the cave
this youth  how distress d  appears he hath had
good ancestors 


arviragus

                  how angel like he sings 


guiderius

but his neat cookery  he cut our roots
in characters 
and sauced our broths  as juno had been sick
and he her dieter 


arviragus

nobly he yokes
a smiling with a sigh  as if the sigh
was that it was  for not being such a smile 
the smile mocking the sigh  that it would fly
from so divine a temple  to commix
with winds that sailors rail at 


guiderius

i do note
that grief and patience  rooted in him both 
mingle their spurs together 


arviragus

grow  patience 
and let the stinking elder  grief  untwine
his perishing root with the increasing vine 


belarius

it is great morning  come  away 
who there 
enter cloten


cloten

i cannot find those runagates  that villain
hath mock me  i am faint 


belarius

 runagates 
means he not us  i partly know him   
cloten  the son o  the queen  i fear some ambush 
i saw him not these many years  and yet
i know  he  we are held as outlaws  hence 


guiderius

he is but one  you and my brother search
what companies are near  pray you  away 
let me alone with him 
exeunt belarius and arviragus


cloten

                  soft  what are you
that fly me thus  some villain mountaineers 
i have heard of such  what slave art thou 


guiderius

a thing
more slavish did i ne than answering
a slave without a knock 


cloten

thou art a robber 
a law breaker  a villain  yield thee  thief 


guiderius

to who  to thee  what art thou  have not i
an arm as big as thine  a heart as big 
thy words  i grant  are bigger  for i wear not
my dagger in my mouth  say what thou art 
why i should yield to thee 


cloten

thou villain base 
know me not by my clothes 


guiderius

no  nor thy tailor  rascal 
who is thy grandfather  he made those clothes 
which  as it seems  make thee 


cloten

thou precious varlet 
my tailor made them not 


guiderius

hence  then  and thank
the man that gave them thee  thou art some fool 
i am loath to beat thee 


cloten

thou injurious thief 
hear but my name  and tremble 


guiderius

what thy name 


cloten

cloten  thou villain 


guiderius

cloten  thou double villain  be thy name 
i cannot tremble at it  were it toad  or
adder  spider 
 move me sooner 


cloten

to thy further fear 
nay  to thy mere confusion  thou shalt know
i am son to the queen 


guiderius

i am sorry for  t  not seeming
so worthy as thy birth 


cloten

art not afeard 


guiderius

those that i reverence those i fear  the wise 
at fools i laugh  not fear them 


cloten

die the death 
when i have slain thee with my proper hand 
i follow those that even now fled hence 
and on the gates of lud s town set your heads 
yield  rustic mountaineer 
exeunt  fighting
re enter belarius and arviragus


belarius

no companies abroad 


arviragus

none in the world  you did mistake him  sure 


belarius

i cannot tell  long is it since i saw him 
but time hath nothing blurr those lines of favour
which then he wore  the snatches in his voice 
and burst of speaking  were as his  i am absolute
 very cloten 


arviragus

                  in this place we left them 
i wish my brother make good time with him 
you say he is so fell 


belarius

being scarce made up 
i mean  to man  he had not apprehension
of roaring terrors  for the effect of judgment
is oft the cause of fear  but  see  thy brother 
re enter guiderius  with cloten head


guiderius

this cloten was a fool  an empty purse 
there was no money in t  not hercules
could have knock out his brains  for he had none 
yet i not doing this  the fool had borne
my head as i do his 


belarius

what hast thou done 


guiderius

i am perfect what  cut off one cloten head 
son to the queen  after his own report 
who call me traitor  mountaineer  and swore
with his own single hand he take us in
displace our heads where thank the gods they grow 
and set them on lud s town 


belarius

we are all undone 


guiderius

why  worthy father  what have we to lose 
but that he swore to take  our lives  the law
protects not us  then why should we be tender
to let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us 
play judge and executioner all himself 
for we do fear the law  what company
discover you abroad 


belarius

no single soul
can we set eye on  but in all safe reason
he must have some attendants  though his humour
was nothing but mutation  ay  and that
from one bad thing to worse  not frenzy  not
absolute madness could so far have raved
to bring him here alone  although perhaps
it may be heard at court that such as we
cave here  hunt here  are outlaws  and in time
may make some stronger head  the which he hearing 
as it is like him might break out  and swear
he fetch us in  yet is not probable
to come alone  either he so undertaking 
or they so suffering  then on good ground we fear 
if we do fear this body hath a tail
more perilous than the head 


arviragus

let ordinance
come as the gods foresay it  howsoe er 
my brother hath done well 


belarius

i had no mind
to hunt this day  the boy fidele sickness
did make my way long forth 


guiderius

with his own sword 
which he did wave against my throat  i have ta 
his head from him  i throw into the creek
behind our rock  and let it to the sea 
and tell the fishes he the queen son  cloten 
that all i reck 
exit


belarius

i fear  be revenged 
would  polydote  thou hadst not done t  though valour
becomes thee well enough 


arviragus

would i had done 
so the revenge alone pursued me  polydore 
i love thee brotherly  but envy much
thou hast robb me of this deed  i would revenges 
that possible strength might meet  would seek us through
and put us to our answer 


belarius

well   done 
we hunt no more to day  nor seek for danger
where there no profit  i prithee  to our rock 
you and fidele play the cooks  i stay
till hasty polydote return  and bring him
to dinner presently 


arviragus

poor sick fidele 
i weringly to him  to gain his colour
i let a parish of such clotens  blood 
and praise myself for charity 
exit


belarius

o thou goddess 
thou divine nature  how thyself thou blazon 
in these two princely boys  they are as gentle
as zephyrs blowing below the violet 
not wagging his sweet head  and yet as rough 
their royal blood enchafed  as the rudest wind 
that by the top doth take the mountain pine 
and make him stoop to the vale   wonder
that an invisible instinct should frame them
to royalty unlearn d  honour untaught 
civility not seen from other  valour
that wildly grows in them  but yields a crop
as if it had been sow d  yet still it strange
what cloten being here to us portends 
or what his death will bring us 
re enter guiderius


guiderius

where my brother 
i have sent cloten clotpoll down the stream 
in embassy to his mother  his body hostage
for his return 
solemn music


belarius

                  my ingenious instrument 
hark  polydore  it sounds  but what occasion
hath cadwal now to give it motion  hark 


guiderius

is he at home 


belarius

                  he went hence even now 


guiderius

what does he mean  since death of my dear mother
it did not speak before  all solemn things
should answer solemn accidents  the matter 
triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
is jollity for apes and grief for boys 
is cadwal mad 


belarius

                  look  here he comes 
and brings the dire occasion in his arms
of what we blame him for 
re enter arviragus  with imogen  as dead  bearing her in his arms


arviragus

the bird is dead
that we have made so much on  i had rather
have skipp from sixteen years of age to sixty 
to have turn my leaping time into a crutch 
than have seen this 


guiderius

o sweetest  fairest lily 
my brother wears thee not the one half so well
as when thou grew thyself 


belarius

o melancholy 
who ever yet could sound thy bottom  find
the ooze  to show what coast thy sluggish crare
might easiliest harbour in  thou blessed thing 
jove knows what man thou mightst have made  but i 
thou diedst  a most rare boy  of melancholy 
how found you him 


arviragus

stark  as you see 
thus smiling  as some fly hid tickled slumber 
not as death dart  being laugh at  his
right cheek
reposing on a cushion 


guiderius

where 


arviragus

o  the floor 
his arms thus leagued  i thought he slept  and put
my clouted brogues from off my feet  whose rudeness
answer my steps too loud 


guiderius

why  he but sleeps 
if he be gone  he make his grave a bed 
with female fairies will his tomb be haunted 
and worms will not come to thee 


arviragus

with fairest flowers
whilst summer lasts and i live here  fidele 
i sweeten thy sad grave  thou shalt not lack
the flower that like thy face  pale primrose  nor
the azured harebell  like thy veins  no  nor
the leaf of eglantine  whom not to slander 
out sweeten not thy breath  the ruddock would 
with charitable bill o bill  sore shaming
those rich left heirs that let their fathers lie
without a monument bring thee all this 
yea  and furr moss besides  when flowers are none 
to winter ground thy corse 


guiderius

prithee  have done 
and do not play in wench like words with that
which is so serious  let us bury him 
and not protract with admiration what
is now due debt  to the grave 


arviragus

say  where shall lay him 


guiderius

by good euriphile  our mother 


arviragus

be so 
and let us  polydore  though now our voices
have got the mannish crack  sing him to the ground 
as once our mother  use like note and words 
save that euriphile must be fidele 


guiderius

cadwal 
i cannot sing  i weep  and word it with thee 
for notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
than priests and fanes that lie 


arviragus

we speak it  then 


belarius

great griefs  i see  medicine the less  for cloten
is quite forgot  he was a queen son  boys 
and though he came our enemy  remember
he was paid for that  though mean and
mighty  rotting
together  have one dust  yet reverence 
that angel of the world  doth make distinction
of place  high and low  our foe was princely
and though you took his life  as being our foe 
yet bury him as a prince 


guiderius

pray you  fetch him hither 
thersites  body is as good as ajax 
when neither are alive 


arviragus

if you go fetch him 
we say our song the whilst  brother  begin 
exit belarius


guiderius

nay  cadwal  we must lay his head to the east 
my father hath a reason for t 


arviragus

guiderius

come on then  and remove him 


arviragus

so  begin

nor the furious winter rages 
thou thy worldly task hast done 
home art gone  and ta thy wages 
golden lads and girls all must 
as chimney sweepers  come to dust

     fear no more the frown o  the great 
thou art past the tyrant stroke 
care no more to clothe and eat 
to thee the reed is as the oak 
the sceptre  learning  physic  must
all follow this  and come to dust 


guiderius

     fear no more the lightning flash 


arviragus

        nor the all dreaded thunder stone 


guiderius

     fear not slander  censure rash 


arviragus

        thou hast finish joy and moan 


guiderius

arviragus

all lovers young  all lovers must
consign to thee  and come to dust 


guiderius

     no exorciser harm thee

belarius

here a few flowers  but  midnight  more 
the herbs that have on them cold dew o  the night
are strewings fitt for graves  upon their faces 
you were as flowers  now wither d  even so
these herblets shall  which we upon you strew 
come on  away  apart upon our knees 
the ground that gave them first has them again 
their pleasures here are past  so is their pain

but  soft  no bedfellow o god s and goddesses 
seeing the body of cloten
these flowers are like the pleasures of the world 
this bloody man  the care on t  i hope i dream 
for so i thought i was a cave keeper 
and cook to honest creatures  but  not so 
 but a bolt of nothing  shot at nothing 
which the brain makes of fumes  our very eyes
are sometimes like our judgments  blind  good faith

yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
as a wren eye  fear gods  a part of it 
the dream here still  even when i wake  it is
without me  as within me  not imagined  felt 
a headless man  the garments of posthumus 
i know the shape of leg  this is his hand

from this most bravest vessel of the world
struck the main top  o posthumus  alas 
where is thy head  where that  ay me 
where that 
pisanio might have kill thee at the heart 
and left this head on  how should this be  pisanio 
 he and cloten  malice and lucre in them
have laid this woe here  o   pregnant  pregnant 
the drug he gave me  which he said was precious
and cordial to me  have i not found it
murderous to the senses  that confirms it home
