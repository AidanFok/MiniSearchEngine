scene iii  a room in cymbeline palace 


enter cymbeline  lords  pisanio  and attendants


cymbeline

again  and bring me word how  with her 
exit an attendant
a fever with the absence of her son 
a madness  of which her life in danger  heavens 
how deeply you at once do touch me  imogen 
the great part of my comfort  gone  my queen
upon a desperate bed  and in a time
when fearful wars point at me  her son gone 
so needful for this present  it strikes me  past
the hope of comfort  but for thee  fellow 
who needs must know of her departure and
dost seem so ignorant  we enforce it from thee
by a sharp torture 


pisanio

sir  my life is yours 
i humbly set it at your will  but  for my mistress 
i nothing know where she remains  why gone 
nor when she purposes return  beseech your highness 
hold me your loyal servant 


first lord

good my liege 
the day that she was missing he was here 
i dare be bound he true and shall perform
all parts of his subjection loyally  for cloten 
there wants no diligence in seeking him 
and will  no doubt  be found 


cymbeline

the time is troublesome 
to pisanio
we slip you for a season  but our jealousy
does yet depend 


first lord

                  so please your majesty 
the roman legions  all from gallia drawn 
are landed on your coast  with a supply
of roman gentlemen  by the senate sent 


cymbeline

now for the counsel of my son and queen 
i am amazed with matter 


first lord

good my liege 
your preparation can affront no less
than what you hear of  come more  for more
you ready 
the want is but to put those powers in motion
that long to move 


cymbeline

                  i thank you  let withdraw 
and meet the time as it seeks us  we fear not
what can from italy annoy us  but
we grieve at chances here  away 
exeunt all but pisanio


pisanio

i heard no letter from my master since
i wrote him imogen was slain   strange 
nor hear i from my mistress who did promise
to yield me often tidings  neither know i
what is betid to cloten  but remain
perplex in all  the heavens still must work 
wherein i am false i am honest  not true  to be true 
these present wars shall find i love my country 
even to the note o  the king  or i fall in them 
all other doubts  by time let them be clear d 
fortune brings in some boats that are not steer d 
exit
