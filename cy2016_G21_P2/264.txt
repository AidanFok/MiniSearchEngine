scene iv  wales  before the cave of belarius 


enter belarius  guiderius  and arviragus 


guiderius

the noise is round about us 


belarius

let us from it 


arviragus

what pleasure  sir  find we in life  to lock it
from action and adventure 


guiderius

nay  what hope
have we in hiding us  this way  the romans
must or for britons slay us  or receive us
for barbarous and unnatural revolts
during their use  and slay us after 


belarius

sons 
we higher to the mountains  there secure us 
to the king party there no going  newness
of cloten death we being not known  not muster 
among the bands may drive us to a render
where we have lived  and so extort from that
which we have done  whose answer would be death
drawn on with torture 


guiderius

this is  sir  a doubt
in such a time nothing becoming you 
nor satisfying us 


arviragus

                  it is not likely
that when they hear the roman horses neigh 
behold their quarter fires  have both their eyes
and ears so cloy importantly as now 
that they will waste their time upon our note 
to know from whence we are 


belarius

o  i am known
of many in the army  many years 
though cloten then but young  you see  not wore him
from my remembrance  and  besides  the king
hath not deserved my service nor your loves 
who find in my exile the want of breeding 
the certainty of this hard life  aye hopeless
to have the courtesy your cradle promised 
but to be still hot summer tamings and
the shrinking slaves of winter 


guiderius

than be so
better to cease to be  pray  sir  to the army 
i and my brother are not known  yourself
so out of thought  and thereto so o ergrown 
cannot be question d 


arviragus

by this sun that shines 
i thither  what thing is it that i never
did see man die  scarce ever look on blood 
but that of coward hares  hot goats  and venison 
never bestrid a horse  save one that had
a rider like myself  who ne wore rowel
nor iron on his heel  i am ashamed
to look upon the holy sun  to have
the benefit of his blest beams  remaining
so long a poor unknown 


guiderius

by heavens  i go 
if you will bless me  sir  and give me leave 
i take the better care  but if you will not 
the hazard therefore due fall on me by
the hands of romans 


arviragus

so say i	amen 


belarius

no reason i  since of your lives you set
so slight a valuation  should reserve
my crack one to more care  have with you  boys 
if in your country wars you chance to die 
that is my bed too  lads  an there i lie 
lead  lead 
aside
the time seems long  their blood
thinks scorn 
till it fly out and show them princes born 
exeunt
