scene i  britain  the roman camp 


enter posthumus  with a bloody handkerchief


posthumus leonatus

yea  bloody cloth  i keep thee  for i wish 
thou shouldst be colour thus  you married ones 
if each of you should take this course  how many
must murder wives much better than themselves
for wrying but a little  o pisanio 
every good servant does not all commands 
no bond but to do just ones  gods  if you
should have ta vengeance on my faults  i never
had lived to put on this  so had you saved
the noble imogen to repent  and struck
me  wretch more worth your vengeance  but  alack 
you snatch some hence for little faults  that love 
to have them fall no more  you some permit
to second ills with ills  each elder worse 
and make them dread it  to the doers  thrift 
but imogen is your own  do your best wills 
and make me blest to obey  i am brought hither
among the italian gentry  and to fight
against my lady kingdom   enough
that  britain  i have kill thy mistress  peace 
i give no wound to thee  therefore  good heavens 
hear patiently my purpose  i disrobe me
of these italian weeds and suit myself
as does a briton peasant  so i fight
against the part i come with  so i die
for thee  o imogen  even for whom my life
is every breath a death  and thus  unknown 
pitied nor hated  to the face of peril
myself i dedicate  let me make men know
more valour in me than my habits show 
gods  put the strength o  the leonati in me 
to shame the guise o  the world  i will begin
the fashion  less without and more within 
exit
