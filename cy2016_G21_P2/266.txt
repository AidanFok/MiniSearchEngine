iachimo

the heaviness and guilt within my bosom
takes off my manhood  i have belied a lady 
the princess of this country  and the air on 
revengingly enfeebles me  or could this carl 
a very drudge of nature s  have subdued me
in my profession  knighthoods and honours  borne
as i wear mine  are titles but of scorn 
if that thy gentry  britain  go before
this lout as he exceeds our lords  the odds
is that we scarce are men and you are gods

the battle continues  the britons fly  cymbeline is  taken  then enter  to his rescue  belarius  guiderius  and arviragus


belarius

stand  stand  we have the advantage of the ground 
the lane is guarded  nothing routs us but
the villany of our fears

away  boy  from the troops  and save thyself 
for friends kill friends  and the disorder such
as war were hoodwink d 


iachimo

 their fresh supplies 


caius lucius

it is a day turn strangely  or betimes
let reinforce  or fly
