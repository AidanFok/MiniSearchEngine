posthumus leonatus

most welcome  bondage  for thou art away 
think  to liberty  yet am i better
than one that sick o  the gout  since he had rather
groan so in perpetuity than be cured
by the sure physician  death  who is the key
to unbar these locks  my conscience  thou art fetter 
more than my shanks and wrists  you good gods  give me
the penitent instrument to pick that bolt 
then  free for ever  is enough i am sorry 
so children temporal fathers do appease 
gods are more full of mercy  must i repent 
i cannot do it better than in gyves 
desired more than constrain d  to satisfy 
if of my freedom  the main part  take
no stricter render of me than my all 
i know you are more clement than vile men 
who of their broken debtors take a third 
a sixth  a tenth  letting them thrive again
on their abatement  that not my desire 
for imogen dear life take mine  and though
 not so dear  yet  a life  you coin it 
 man and man they weigh not every stamp 
though light  take pieces for the figure sake 
you rather mine  being yours  and so  great powers 
if you will take this audit  take this life 
and cancel these cold bonds  o imogen 
i speak to thee in silence 
sleeps
solemn music  enter  as in an apparition   sicilius leonatus  father to posthumus leonatus   an old man  attired like a warrior  leading in  his hand an ancient matron  his wife  and mother  to posthumus leonatus  with music before them   then  after other music  follow the two young  leonati  brothers to posthumus leonatus  with  wounds as they died in the wars  they circle posthumus leonatus round  as he lies sleeping


sicilius leonatus

no more  thou thunder master  show
thy spite on mortal flies 
with mars fall out  with juno chide 
that thy adulteries
rates and revenges 
hath my poor boy done aught but well 
whose face i never saw 
i died whilst in the womb he stay 
attending nature law 
whose father then  as men report
thou orphans  father art 
thou shouldst have been  and shielded him
from this earth vexing smart 


mother

lucina lent not me her aid 
but took me in my throes 
that from me was posthumus ript 
came crying  his foes 
a thing of pity 


sicilius leonatus

great nature  like his ancestry 
moulded the stuff so fair 
that he deserved the praise o  the world 
as great sicilius  heir 


first brother

when once he was mature for man 
in britain where was he
that could stand up his parallel 
or fruitful object be
in eye of imogen  that best
could deem his dignity 


mother

with marriage wherefore was he mock d 
to be exiled  and thrown
from leonati seat  and cast
from her his dearest one 
sweet imogen 


sicilius leonatus

why did you suffer iachimo 
slight thing of italy 
to taint his nobler heart and brain
with needless jealosy 
and to become the geck and scorn
o  th  other villany 


second brother

for this from stiller seats we came 
our parents and us twain 
that striking in our country cause
fell bravely and were slain 
our fealty and tenantius  right
with honour to maintain 


first brother

like hardiment posthumus hath
to cymbeline perform d 
then  jupiter  thou king of gods 
why hast thou thus adjourn 
the graces for his merits due 
being all to dolours turn d 


sicilius leonatus

thy crystal window ope  look out 
no longer exercise
upon a valiant race thy harsh
and potent injuries 


mother

since  jupiter  our son is good 
take off his miseries 


sicilius leonatus

peep through thy marble mansion  help 
or we poor ghosts will cry
to the shining synod of the rest
against thy deity 


first brother

second brother

help  jupiter  or we appeal 
and from thy justice fly 
jupiter descends in thunder and lightning  sitting  upon an eagle  he throws a thunderbolt  the apparitions fall on their knees


jupiter

no more  you petty spirits of region low 
offend our hearing  hush  how dare you ghosts
accuse the thunderer  whose bolt  you know 
sky planted batters all rebelling coasts 
poor shadows of elysium  hence  and rest
upon your never withering banks of flowers 
be not with mortal accidents opprest 
no care of yours it is  you know  ours 
whom best i love i cross  to make my gift 
the more delay d  delighted  be content 
your low laid son our godhead will uplift 
his comforts thrive  his trials well are spent 
our jovial star reign at his birth  and in
our temple was he married  rise  and fade 
he shall be lord of lady imogen 
and happier much by his affliction made 
this tablet lay upon his breast  wherein
our pleasure his full fortune doth confine 
and so  away  no further with your din
express impatience  lest you stir up mine 
mount  eagle  to my palace crystalline 
ascends


sicilius leonatus

he came in thunder  his celestial breath
was sulphurous to smell  the holy eagle
stoop as to foot us  his ascension is
more sweet than our blest fields  his royal bird
prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak 
as when his god is pleased 


all

thanks  jupiter 


sicilius leonatus

the marble pavement closes  he is enter 
his radiant root  away  and  to be blest 
let us with care perform his great behest 
the apparitions vanish


posthumus leonatus

 waking   sleep  thou hast been a grandsire  and begot
a father to me  and thou hast created
a mother and two brothers  but  o scorn 
gone  they went hence so soon as they were born 
and so i am awake  poor wretches that depend
on greatness  favour dream as i have done 
wake and find nothing  but  alas  i swerve 
many dream not to find  neither deserve 
and yet are steep in favours  so am i 
that have this golden chance and know not why 
what fairies haunt this ground  a book  o rare one 
be not  as is our fangled world  a garment
nobler than that it covers  let thy effects
so follow  to be most unlike our courtiers 
as good as promise 
reads
 as a lion whelp shall  to himself unknown 
without seeking find  and be embraced by a piece of
tender air  and when from a stately cedar shall be
lopped branches  which  being dead many years 
shall after revive  be jointed to the old stock and
freshly grow  then shall posthumus end his miseries 
britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty 
 still a dream  or else such stuff as madmen
tongue and brain not  either both or nothing 
or senseless speaking or a speaking such
as sense cannot untie  be what it is 
the action of my life is like it  which
i keep  if but for sympathy 
re enter first gaoler


first gaoler

come  sir  are you ready for death 


posthumus leonatus

over roasted rather  ready long ago 


first gaoler

hanging is the word  sir  if
you be ready for that  you are well cooked 


posthumus leonatus

so  if i prove a good repast to the
spectators  the dish pays the shot 


first gaoler

a heavy reckoning for you  sir  but the comfort is 
you shall be called to no more payments  fear no
more tavern bills  which are often the sadness of
parting  as the procuring of mirth  you come in
flint for want of meat  depart reeling with too
much drink  sorry that you have paid too much  and
sorry that you are paid too much  purse and brain
both empty  the brain the heavier for being too
light  the purse too light  being drawn of
heaviness  of this contradiction you shall now be
quit  o  the charity of a penny cord  it sums up
thousands in a trice  you have no true debitor and
creditor but it  of what past  is  and to come 
the discharge  your neck  sir  is pen  book and
counters  so the acquittance follows 


posthumus leonatus

i am merrier to die than thou art to live 


first gaoler

indeed  sir  he that sleeps feels not the
tooth ache  but a man that were to sleep your
sleep  and a hangman to help him to bed  i think he
would change places with his officer  for  look you 
sir  you know not which way you shall go 


posthumus leonatus

yes  indeed do i  fellow 


first gaoler

your death has eyes in  head then  i have not seen
him so pictured  you must either be directed by
some that take upon them to know  or do take upon
yourself that which i am sure you do not know  or
jump the after inquiry on your own peril  and how
you shall speed in your journey end  i think you 
never return to tell one 


posthumus leonatus

i tell thee  fellow  there are none want eyes to
direct them the way i am going  but such as wink and
will not use them 


first gaoler

what an infinite mock is this  that a man should
have the best use of eyes to see the way of
blindness  i am sure hanging the way of winking 
enter a messenger


messenger

knock off his manacles  bring your prisoner to the king 


posthumus leonatus

thou bring good news  i am called to be made free 


first gaoler

i be hang then 


posthumus leonatus

thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler  no bolts for the dead 
exeunt posthumus leonatus and messenger


first gaoler

unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
gibbets  i never saw one so prone  yet  on my
conscience  there are verier knaves desire to live 
for all he be a roman  and there be some of them
too that die against their wills  so should i  if i
were one  i would we were all of one mind  and one
mind good  o  there were desolation of gaolers and
gallowses  i speak against my present profit  but
my wish hath a preferment in  t 
exeunt
