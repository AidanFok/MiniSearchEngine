cymbeline

stand by my side  you whom the gods have made
preservers of my throne  woe is my heart
that the poor soldier that so richly fought 
whose rags shamed gilded arms  whose naked breast
stepp before larges of proof  cannot be found 
he shall be happy that can find him  if
our grace can make him so 


belarius

i never saw
such noble fury in so poor a thing 
such precious deeds in one that promises nought
but beggary and poor looks 


cymbeline

no tidings of him 


pisanio

he hath been search among the dead and living 
but no trace of him 


cymbeline

to my grief  i am
the heir of his reward 
to belarius  guiderius  and arviragus
which i will add
to you  the liver  heart and brain of britain 
by whom i grant she lives   now the time
to ask of whence you are  report it 


belarius

sir

further to boast were neither true nor modest 
unless i add  we are honest

companions to our person and will fit you
with dignities becoming your estates 
enter cornelius and ladies
there business in these faces  why so sadly
greet you our victory  you look like romans 
and not o  the court of britain 


cornelius

hail  great king 
to sour your happiness  i must report
the queen is dead 


cymbeline

who worse than a physician
would this report become  but i consider 
by medicine life may be prolong d  yet death
will seize the doctor too  how ended she 


cornelius

with horror  madly dying  like her life 
which  being cruel to the world  concluded
most cruel to herself  what she confess 
i will report  so please you  these her women
can trip me  if i err  who with wet cheeks
were present when she finish d 


cymbeline

prithee  say 


cornelius

first  she confess she never loved you  only
affected greatness got by you  not you 
married your royalty  was wife to your place 
abhorr your person 


cymbeline

she alone knew this 
and  but she spoke it dying  i would not
believe her lips in opening it  proceed 


cornelius

your daughter  whom she bore in hand to love
with such integrity  she did confess
was as a scorpion to her sight  whose life 
but that her flight prevented it  she had
ta off by poison 


cymbeline

o most delicate fiend 
who is  can read a woman  is there more 


cornelius

more  sir  and worse  she did confess she had
for you a mortal mineral  which  being took 
should by the minute feed on life and lingering
by inches waste you  in which time she purposed 
by watching  weeping  tendance  kissing  to
o you with her show  and in time 
when she had fitted you with her craft  to work
her son into the adoption of the crown 
but  failing of her end by his strange absence 
grew shameless desperate  open d  in despite
of heaven and men  her purposes  repented
the evils she hatch were not effected  so
despairing died 


cymbeline

                  heard you all this  her women 


first lady

we did  so please your highness 


cymbeline

mine eyes
were not in fault  for she was beautiful 
mine ears  that heard her flattery  nor my heart 
that thought her like her seeming  it had
been vicious
to have mistrusted her  yet  o my daughter 
that it was folly in me  thou mayst say 
and prove it in thy feeling  heaven mend all 
enter lucius  iachimo  the soothsayer  and other  roman prisoners  guarded  posthumus leonatus behind  and imogen
thou comest not  caius  now for tribute that
the britons have razed out  though with the loss
of many a bold one  whose kinsmen have made suit
that their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
of you their captives  which ourself have granted 
so think of your estate 


caius lucius

consider  sir  the chance of war  the day
was yours by accident  had it gone with us 
we should not  when the blood was cool 
have threaten 
our prisoners with the sword  but since the gods
will have it thus  that nothing but our lives
may be call ransom  let it come  sufficeth
a roman with a roman heart can suffer 
augustus lives to think on t  and so much
for my peculiar care  this one thing only
i will entreat  my boy  a briton born 
let him be ransom d  never master had
a page so kind  so duteous  diligent 
so tender over his occasions  true 
so feat  so nurse like  let his virtue join
with my request  which i make bold your highness
cannot deny  he hath done no briton harm 
though he have served a roman  save him  sir 
and spare no blood beside 


cymbeline

i have surely seen him 
his favour is familiar to me  boy 
thou hast look thyself into my grace 
and art mine own  i know not why  wherefore 
to say  live  boy  ne thank thy master  live 
and ask of cymbeline what boon thou wilt 
fitting my bounty and thy state  i give it 
yea  though thou do demand a prisoner 
the noblest ta en 


imogen

                  i humbly thank your highness 


caius lucius

i do not bid thee beg my life  good lad 
and yet i know thou wilt 


imogen

no  no  alack 
there other work in hand  i see a thing
bitter to me as death  your life  good master 
must shuffle for itself 


caius lucius

the boy disdains me 
he leaves me  scorns me  briefly die their joys
that place them on the truth of girls and boys 
why stands he so perplex d 


cymbeline

what wouldst thou  boy 
i love thee more and more  think more and more
what best to ask  know him thou look on  speak 
wilt have him live  is he thy kin  thy friend 


imogen

he is a roman  no more kin to me
than i to your highness  who  being born your vassal 
am something nearer 


cymbeline

wherefore eyest him so 


imogen

i tell you  sir  in private  if you please
to give me hearing 


cymbeline

ay  with all my heart 
and lend my best attention  what thy name 


imogen

i be thy master  walk with me  speak freely 
cymbeline and imogen converse apart


belarius

is not this boy revived from death 


arviragus

one sand another
not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
who died  and was fidele  what think you 


guiderius

the same dead thing alive 


belarius

peace  peace  see further  he eyes us not  forbear 
creatures may be alike  were  he  i am sure
he would have spoke to us 


guiderius

but we saw him dead 


belarius

be silent  let see further 


pisanio

 aside 	it is my mistress 
since she is living  let the time run on
to good or bad 
cymbeline and imogen come forward


cymbeline

                  come  stand thou by our side 
make thy demand aloud 
to iachimo
sir  step you forth 
give answer to this boy  and do it freely 
or  by our greatness and the grace of it 
which is our honour  bitter torture shall
winnow the truth from falsehood  on  speak to him 


imogen

my boon is  that this gentleman may render
of whom he had this ring 


posthumus leonatus

 aside                  what that to him 


cymbeline

that diamond upon your finger  say
how came it yours 


iachimo

thou torture me to leave unspoken that
which  to be spoke  would torture thee 


cymbeline

how  me 


iachimo

i am glad to be constrain to utter that
which torments me to conceal  by villany
i got this ring   leonatus  jewel 
whom thou didst banish  and which more may
grieve thee 
as it doth me a nobler sir ne lived
 sky and ground  wilt thou hear more  my lord 


cymbeline

all that belongs to this 


iachimo

that paragon  thy daughter 
for whom my heart drops blood  and my false spirits
quail to remember give me leave  i faint 


cymbeline

my daughter  what of her  renew thy strength 
i had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
than die ere i hear more  strive  man  and speak 


iachimo

upon a time unhappy was the clock
that struck the hour it was in rome accursed
the mansion where at a feast o  would
our viands had been poison d  or at least
those which i heaved to head the good posthumus 
what should i say  he was too good to be
where ill men were  and was the best of all
amongst the rarest of good ones sitting sadly 
hearing us praise our loves of italy
for beauty that made barren the swell boast
of him that best could speak  for feature  laming
the shrine of venus  or straight pight minerva 
postures beyond brief nature  for condition 
a shop of all the qualities that man
loves woman for  besides that hook of wiving 
fairness which strikes the eye 


cymbeline

i stand on fire 
come to the matter 


iachimo

all too soon i shall 
unless thou wouldst grieve quickly  this posthumus 
most like a noble lord in love and one
that had a royal lover  took his hint 
and  not dispraising whom we praised therein
he was as calm as virtue he began
his mistress  picture  which by his tongue
being made 
and then a mind put in t  either our brags
were crack of kitchen trolls  or his description
proved us unspeaking sots 


cymbeline

nay  nay  to the purpose 


iachimo

your daughter chastity there it begins 
he spake of her  as dian had hot dreams 
and she alone were cold  whereat i  wretch 
made scruple of his praise  and wager with him
pieces of gold  this which then he wore
upon his honour finger  to attain
in suit the place of bed and win this ring
by hers and mine adultery  he  true knight 
no lesser of her honour confident
than i did truly find her  stakes this ring 
and would so  had it been a carbuncle
of phoebus  wheel  and might so safely  had it
been all the worth of car  away to britain
post i in this design  well may you  sir 
remember me at court  where i was taught
of your chaste daughter the wide difference
 amorous and villanous  being thus quench 
of hope  not longing  mine italian brain
 in your duller britain operate
most vilely  for my vantage  excellent 
and  to be brief  my practise so prevail d 
that i return with simular proof enough
to make the noble leonatus mad 
by wounding his belief in her renown
with tokens thus  and thus  averting notes
of chamber hanging  pictures  this her bracelet 
o cunning  how i got it nay  some marks
of secret on her person  that he could not
but think her bond of chastity quite crack d 
i having ta the forfeit  whereupon 
methinks  i see him now 


posthumus leonatus

 advancing              ay  so thou dost 
italian fiend  ay me  most credulous fool 
egregious murderer  thief  any thing
that due to all the villains past  in being 
to come  o  give me cord  or knife  or poison 
some upright justicer  thou  king  send out
for torturers ingenious  it is i
that all the abhorred things o  the earth amend
by being worse than they  i am posthumus 
that kill thy daughter villain like  i lie 
that caused a lesser villain than myself 
a sacrilegious thief  to do t  the temple
of virtue was she  yea  and she herself 
spit  and throw stone s  cast mire upon me  set
the dogs o  the street to bay me  every villain
be call posthumus leonitus  and
be villany less than  twas  o imogen 
my queen  my life  my wife  o imogen 
imogen  imogen 


imogen

                  peace  my lord  hear  hear 


posthumus leonatus

there lie thy part 
striking her  she falls


pisanio

o  gentlemen  help 
mine and your mistress  o  my lord posthumus 
you ne kill imogen til now  help  help 
mine honour lady 


cymbeline

posthumus leonatus

how come these staggers on me 


pisanio

cymbeline

if this be so  the gods do mean to strike me
to death with mortal joy 


pisanio

how fares thy mistress 


imogen

o  get thee from my sight 
thou gavest me poison  dangerous fellow  hence 
breathe not where princes are 


cymbeline

the tune of imogen 


pisanio

lady 
the gods throw stones of sulphur on me  if
that box i gave you was not thought by me
a precious thing  i had it from the queen 


cymbeline

new matter still 


imogen

                  it poison me 


cornelius

o gods 
i left out one thing which the queen confess d 
which must approve thee honest   pisanio
have  said she   his mistress that confection
which i gave him for cordial  she is served
as i would serve a rat 


cymbeline

what this  comelius 


cornelius

the queen  sir  very oft importuned me
to temper poisons for her  still pretending
the satisfaction of her knowledge only
in killing creatures vile  as cats and dogs 
of no esteem  i  dreading that her purpose
was of more danger  did compound for her
a certain stuff  which  being ta en  would cease
the present power of life  but in short time
all offices of nature should again
do their due functions  have you ta of it 


imogen

most like i did  for i was dead 


belarius

my boys 
there was our error 


guiderius

this is  sure  fidele 


imogen

why did you throw your wedded lady from you 
think that you are upon a rock  and now
throw me again 
embracing him


posthumus leonatus

hang there like a fruit  my soul 
till the tree die 


cymbeline

                  how now  my flesh  my child 
what  makest thou me a dullard in this act 
wilt thou not speak to me 


imogen

 kneeling                your blessing  sir 


belarius

 to guiderius and arviragus   though you did love
this youth  i blame ye not 
you had a motive for t 


cymbeline

my tears that fall
prove holy water on thee  imogen 
thy mother dead 


imogen

i am sorry for t  my lord 


cymbeline

o  she was nought  and long of her it was
that we meet here so strangely  but her son
is gone  we know not how nor where 


pisanio

my lord 
now fear is from me  i speak troth  lord cloten 
upon my lady missing  came to me
with his sword drawn  foam at the mouth  and swore 
if i discover not which way she was gone 
it was my instant death  by accident 
had a feigned letter of my master 
then in my pocket  which directed him
to seek her on the mountains near to milford 
where  in a frenzy  in my master garments 
which he enforced from me  away he posts
with unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
my lady honour  what became of him
i further know not 


guiderius

let me end the story 
i slew him there 


cymbeline

marry  the gods forfend 
i would not thy good deeds should from my lips
pluck a bard sentence  prithee  valiant youth 
deny again 


guiderius

                  i have spoke it  and i did it 


cymbeline

he was a prince 


guiderius

a most incivil one  the wrongs he did me
were nothing prince like  for he did provoke me
with language that would make me spurn the sea 
if it could so roar to me  i cut off head 
and am right glad he is not standing here
to tell this tale of mine 


cymbeline

i am sorry for thee 
by thine own tongue thou art condemn d  and must
endure our law  thou dead 


imogen

that headless man
i thought had been my lord 


cymbeline

bind the offender 
and take him from our presence 


belarius

stay  sir king 
this man is better than the man he slew 
as well descended as thyself  and hath
more of thee merited than a band of clotens
had ever scar for 
to the guard
let his arms alone 
they were not born for bondage 


cymbeline

why  old soldier 
wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for 
by tasting of our wrath  how of descent
as good as we 


arviragus

                  in that he spake too far 


cymbeline

and thou shalt die for t 


belarius

we will die all three 
but i will prove that two on are as good
as i have given out him  my sons  i must 
for mine own part  unfold a dangerous speech 
though  haply  well for you 


arviragus

your danger ours 


guiderius

and our good his 


belarius

                  have at it then  by leave 
thou hadst  great king  a subject who
was call belarius 


cymbeline

what of him  he is
a banish traitor 


belarius

he it is that hath
assumed this age  indeed a banish man 
i know not how a traitor 


cymbeline

take him hence 
the whole world shall not save him 


belarius

not too hot 
first pay me for the nursing of thy sons 
and let it be confiscate all  so soon
as i have received it 


cymbeline

nursing of my sons 


belarius

i am too blunt and saucy  here my knee 
ere i arise  i will prefer my sons 
then spare not the old father  mighty sir 
these two young gentlemen  that call me father
and think they are my sons  are none of mine 
they are the issue of your loins  my liege 
and blood of your begetting 


cymbeline

how  my issue 


belarius

so sure as you your father s  i  old morgan 
am that belarius whom you sometime banish d 
your pleasure was my mere offence  my punishment
itself  and all my treason  that i suffer 
was all the harm i did  these gentle princes 
for such and so they are these twenty years
have i train up  those arts they have as i
could put into them  my breeding was  sir  as
your highness knows  their nurse  euriphile 
whom for the theft i wedded  stole these children
upon my banishment  i moved her to t 
having received the punishment before 
for that which i did then  beaten for loyalty
excited me to treason  their dear loss 
the more of you  felt  the more it shaped
unto my end of stealing them  but  gracious sir 
here are your sons again  and i must lose
two of the sweet companions in the world 
the benediction of these covering heavens
fall on their heads like dew  for they are worthy
to inlay heaven with stars 


cymbeline

thou weep st  and speak st 
the service that you three have done is more
unlike than this thou tell st  i lost my children 
if these be they  i know not how to wish
a pair of worthier sons 


belarius

be pleased awhile 
this gentleman  whom i call polydore 
most worthy prince  as yours  is true guiderius 
this gentleman  my cadwal  arviragus 
your younger princely son  he  sir  was lapp 
in a most curious mantle  wrought by the hand
of his queen mother  which for more probation
i can with ease produce 


cymbeline

guiderius had
upon his neck a mole  a sanguine star 
it was a mark of wonder 


belarius

this is he 
who hath upon him still that natural stamp 
it was wise nature end in the donation 
to be his evidence now 


cymbeline

o  what  am i
a mother to the birth of three  ne mother
rejoiced deliverance more  blest pray you be 
that  after this strange starting from your orbs 
may reign in them now  o imogen 
thou hast lost by this a kingdom 


imogen

no  my lord 
i have got two worlds by  t  o my gentle brothers 
have we thus met  o  never say hereafter
but i am truest speaker you call me brother 
when i was but your sister  i you brothers 
when ye were so indeed 


cymbeline

did you e meet 


arviragus

ay  my good lord 


guiderius

                  and at first meeting loved 
continued so  until we thought he died 


cornelius

by the queen dram she swallow d 


cymbeline

o rare instinct 
when shall i hear all through  this fierce
abridgement
hath to it circumstantial branches  which
distinction should be rich in  where  how lived you 
and when came you to serve our roman captive 
how parted with your brothers  how first met them 
why fled you from the court  and whither  these 
and your three motives to the battle  with
i know not how much more  should be demanded 
and all the other by dependencies 
from chance to chance  but nor the time nor place
will serve our long inter gatories  see 
posthumus anchors upon imogen 
and she  like harmless lightning  throws her eye
on him  her brother  me  her master  hitting
each object with a joy  the counterchange
is severally in all  let quit this ground 
and smoke the temple with our sacrifices 
to belarius
thou art my brother  so we hold thee ever 


imogen

you are my father too  and did relieve me 
to see this gracious season 


cymbeline

all o erjoy d 
save these in bonds  let them be joyful too 
for they shall taste our comfort 


imogen

my good master 
i will yet do you service 


caius lucius

happy be you 


cymbeline

the forlorn soldier  that so nobly fought 
he would have well becomed this place  and graced
the thankings of a king 


posthumus leonatus

i am  sir 
the soldier that did company these three
in poor beseeming   a fitment for
the purpose i then follow d  that i was he 
speak  iachimo  i had you down and might
have made you finish 


iachimo

 kneeling           i am down again 
but now my heavy conscience sinks my knee 
as then your force did  take that life  beseech you 
which i so often owe  but your ring first 
and here the bracelet of the truest princess
that ever swore her faith 


posthumus leonatus

kneel not to me 
the power that i have on you is  to spare you 
the malice towards you to forgive you  live 
and deal with others better 


cymbeline

nobly doom d 
we learn our freeness of a son in law 
pardon the word to all 


arviragus

you holp us  sir 
as you did mean indeed to be our brother 
joy are we that you are 


posthumus leonatus

your servant  princes  good my lord of rome 
call forth your soothsayer  as i slept  methought
great jupiter  upon his eagle back d 
appear to me  with other spritely shows
of mine own kindred  when i waked  i found
this label on my bosom  whose containing
is so from sense in hardness  that i can
make no collection of it  let him show
his skill in the construction 


caius lucius

philarmonus 


soothsayer

here  my good lord 


caius lucius

read  and declare the meaning 


soothsayer

 reads    as a lion whelp shall  to himself
unknown  without seeking find  and be embraced by a
piece of tender air  and when from a stately cedar
shall be lopped branches  which  being dead many
years  shall after revive  be jointed to the old
stock  and freshly grow  then shall posthumus end
his miseries  britain be fortunate and flourish in
peace and plenty 
thou  leonatus  art the lion whelp 
the fit and apt construction of thy name 
being leonatus  doth import so much 
to cymbeline
the piece of tender air  thy virtuous daughter 
which we call  aer  and  aer 
we term it  mulier  which  mulier  i divine
is this most constant wife  who  even now 
answering the letter of the oracle 
unknown to you  unsought  were clipp about
with this most tender air 


cymbeline

this hath some seeming 


soothsayer

the lofty cedar  royal cymbeline 
personates thee  and thy lopp branches point
thy two sons forth  who  by belarius stol n 
for many years thought dead  are now revived 
to the majestic cedar join d  whose issue
promises britain peace and plenty 


cymbeline

well
my peace we will begin  and  caius lucius 
although the victor  we submit to caesar 
and to the roman empire  promising
to pay our wonted tribute  from the which
we were dissuaded by our wicked queen 
whom heavens  in justice  both on her and hers 
have laid most heavy hand 


soothsayer

the fingers of the powers above do tune
the harmony of this peace  the vision
which i made known to lucius  ere the stroke
of this yet scarce cold battle  at this instant
is full accomplish d  for the roman eagle 
from south to west on wing soaring aloft 
lessen herself  and in the beams o  the sun
so vanish d  which foreshow our princely eagle 
the imperial caesar  should again unite
his favour with the radiant cymbeline 
which shines here in the west 


cymbeline

laud we the gods 
and let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
from our blest altars  publish we this peace
to all our subjects  set we forward  let
a roman and a british ensign wave
friendly together  so through lud s town march 
and in the temple of great jupiter
our peace we ratify  seal it with feasts 
set on there  never was a war did cease 
ere bloody hands were wash d  with such a peace 
exeunt
