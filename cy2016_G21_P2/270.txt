of bowhay in devon  esquire 


the love i bore to your brother  and will do to his memory  hath craved
from me this last duty of a friend  i am herein but a second to the
privilege of truth  who can warrant more in his behalf than i undertook to
deliver   exercise in this kind i will little affect  and am less addicted
to  but there must be miracle in that labor which  to witness my
remembrance to this departed gentleman  i would not willingly undergo   yet
whatsoever is here done  is done to him and to him only  for whom and whose
sake i will not forget to remember any friendly respects to you  or to any
of those that have loved him for himself  and himself for his
deserts

a funeral elegy 



        since time  and his predestinated end 
        abridged the circuit of his hopeful days 
        whiles both his youth and virtue did intend
        the good endeavors of deserving praise 
5       what memorable monument can last
        whereon to build his never blemished name
        but his own worth  wherein his life was graced     
        sith as that ever he maintained the same 
        oblivion in the darkest day to come 
10      when sin shall tread on merit in the dust 
        cannot rase out the lamentable tomb
        of his short lived deserts  but still they must 
        even in the hearts and memories of men 
        claim fit respect  that they  in every limb
15      remembering what he was  with comfort then
        may pattern out one truly good  by him 
        for he was truly good  if honest care
        of harmless conversation may commend
        a life free from such stains as follies are 
20      ill recompensed only in his end 
        nor can the tongue of him who loved him least
         if there can be minority of love
        to one superlative above the rest
        of many men in steady faith  reprove
25      his constant temper  in the equal weight
        of thankfulness and kindness  truth doth leave
        sufficient proof  he was in every right
        as kind to give  as thankful to receive 
        the curious eye of a quick brained survey
30      could scantly find a mote amidst the sun
        of his too shortened days  or make a prey
        of any faulty errors he had done 
        not that he was above the spleenful sense
        and spite of malice  but for that he had
35      warrant enough in his own innocence
        against the sting of some in nature bad 
        yet who is he so absolutely blest
        that lives encompassed in a mortal frame 
        sometime in reputation not oppressed
40      by some in nothing famous but defame 
        such in the bypath and the ridgeway lurk
        that leads to ruin  in a smooth pretense
        of what they do to be a special work
        of singleness  not tending to offense 
45      whose very virtues are  not to detract
        whiles hope remains of gain  base fee of slaves 
        despising chiefly men in fortunes wracked 
        but death to such gives unremembered graves 
          now therein lived he happy  if to be
50        free from detraction happiness it be 
        his younger years gave comfortable hope
        to hope for comfort in his riper youth 
        which  harvest like  did yield again the crop
        of education  bettered in his truth 
55      those noble twins of heaven infused races 
        learning and wit  refined in their kind
        did jointly both  in their peculiar graces 
        enrich the curious temple of his mind 
        indeed a temple  in whose precious white
60      sat reason by religion overswayed 
        teaching his other senses  with delight 
        how piety and zeal should be obeyed 
        not fruitlessly in prodigal expense
        wasting his best of time  but so content
65      with reason golden mean to make defense
        against the assault of youth encouragement 
        as not the tide of this surrounding age
         when now his father death had freed his will 
        could make him subject to the drunken rage
70      of such whose only glory is their ill 
        he from the happy knowledge of the wise
        draws virtue to reprove secured fools
        and shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice
        to spend his spring of days in sacred schools 
75      here gave he diet to the sick desires
        that day by day assault the weaker man 
        and with fit moderation still retires
        from what doth batter virtue now and then 
        but that i not intend in full discourse
80      to progress out his life  i could display
        a good man in each part exact and force
        the common voice to warrant what i say 
        for if his fate and heaven had decreed
        that full of days he might have lived to see
85      the grave in peace  the times that should succeed
        had been best speaking witnesses with me 
        whose conversation so untouched did move
        respect most in itself  as who would scan
        his honesty and worth  by them might prove
90      he was a kind  true  perfect gentleman 
        not in the outside of disgraceful folly 
        courting opinion with unfit disguise 
        affecting fashions  nor addicted wholly
        to unbeseeming blushless vanities 
95        but suiting so his habit and desire
          as that his virtue was his best attire 
        not in the waste of many idle words
        cared he to be heard talk  nor in the float
        of fond conceit  such as this age affords 
100     by vain discourse upon himself to dote 
        for his becoming silence gave such grace
        to his judicious parts  as what he spake
        seemed rather answers which the wise embrace
        than busy questions such as talkers make 
105     and though his qualities might well deserve
        just commendation  yet his furnished mind
        such harmony of goodness did preserve
        as nature never built in better kind 
        knowing the best  and therefore not presuming
110     in knowing  but for that it was the best 
        ever within himself free choice resuming
        of true perfection  in a perfect breast 
        so that his mind and body made an inn 
        the one to lodge the other  both like framed
115     for fair conditions  guests that soonest win
        applause  in generality  well famed 
        if trim behavior  gestures mild  discreet
        endeavors  modest speech  beseeming mirth 
        true friendship  active grace  persuasion sweet 
120     delightful love innated from his birth 
        acquaintance unfamiliar  carriage just 
        offenseless resolution  wished sobriety 
        clean tempered moderation  steady trust 
        unburthened conscience  unfeigned piety 
125     if these  or all of these  knit fast in one
        can merit praise  then justly may we say 
        not any from this frailer stage is gone
        whose name is like to live a longer day     
        though not in eminent courts or places great
130     for popular concourse  yet in that soil
        where he enjoyed his birth  life  death  and seat
        which now sits mourning his untimely spoil 
        and as much glory is it to be good
        for private persons  in their private home 
135     as those descended from illustrious blood
        in public view of greatness  whence they come 
        though i  rewarded with some sadder taste
        of knowing shame  by feeling it have proved
        my country thankless misconstruction cast
140     upon my name and credit  both unloved
        by some whose fortunes  sunk into the wane
        of plenty and desert  have strove to win
        justice by wrong  and sifted to embane
        my reputation with a witless sin 
145     yet time  the father of unblushing truth 
        may one day lay ope malice which hath crossed it 
        and right the hopes of my endangered youth 
        purchasing credit in the place i lost it 
        even in which place the subject of the verse
150      unhappy matter of a mourning style
        which now that subject merits doth rehearse 
        had education and new being  while
        by fair demeanor he had won repute
        amongst the all of all that lived there 
155     for that his actions did so wholly suit
        with worthiness  still memorable here 
        the many hours till the day of doom
        will not consume his life and hapless end 
        for should he lie obscured without a tomb 
160     time would to time his honesty commend 
        whiles parents to their children will make known 
        and they to their posterity impart 
        how such a man was sadly overthrown
        by a hand guided by a cruel heart 
165       whereof as many as shall hear that sadness
          will blame the one hard fate  the other madness 
        whiles such as do recount that tale of woe 
        told by remembrance of the wisest heads 
        will in the end conclude the matter so 
170     as they will all go weeping to their beds 
        for when the world lies wintered in the storms
        of fearful consummation  and lays down
        th  unsteady change of his fantastic forms 
        expecting ever to be overthrown 
175     when the proud height of much affected sin
        shall ripen to a head  and in that pride
        end in the miseries it did begin
        and fall amidst the glory of his tide 
        then in a book where every work is writ
180     shall this man actions be revealed  to show
        the gainful fruit of well employed wit 
        which paid to heaven the debt that it did owe 
        here shall be reckoned up the constant faith 
        never untrue  where once he love professed 
185     which is a miracle in men  one saith 
        long sought though rarely found  and he is best
          who can make friendship  in those times of change 
          admired more for being firm than strange 
        when those weak houses of our brittle flesh
190     shall ruined be by death  our grace and strength 
        youth  memory and shape that made us fresh
        cast down  and utterly decayed at length 
        when all shall turn to dust from whence we came
        and we low leveled in a narrow grave 
195     what can we leave behind us but a name 
        which  by a life well led  may honor have 
        such honor  o thou youth untimely lost 
        thou didst deserve and hast  for though thy soul
        hath took her flight to a diviner coast 
200     yet here on earth thy fame lives ever whole 
        in every heart sealed up  in every tongue
        fit matter to discourse  no day prevented
        that pities not thy sad and sudden wrong 
        of all alike beloved and lamented 
205     and i here to thy memorable worth 
        in this last act of friendship  sacrifice
        my love to thee  which i could not set forth
        in any other habit of disguise 
        although i could not learn  whiles yet thou wert 
210     to speak the language of a servile breath 
        my truth stole from my tongue into my heart 
        which shall not thence be sundered  but in death 
        and i confess my love was too remiss
        that had not made thee know how much i prized thee 
215     but that mine error was  as yet it is 
        to think love best in silence  for i sized thee
        by what i would have been  not only ready
        in telling i was thine  but being so 
        by some effect to show it   he is steady
220     who seems less than he is in open show 
        since then i still reserved to try the worst
        which hardest fate and time thus can lay on me 
        t  enlarge my thoughts was hindered at first 
        while thou hadst life  i took this task upon me 
225     to register with mine unhappy pen
        such duties as it owes to thy desert 
        and set thee as a president to men 
        and limn thee to the world but as thou wert     
        not hired  as heaven can witness in my soul 
230     by vain conceit  to please such ones as know it 
        nor servile to be liked  free from control 
        which  pain to many men  i do not owe it 
        but here i trust i have discharged now
         fair lovely branch too soon cut off  to thee 
235     my constant and irrefragable vow 
        as  had it chanced  thou mightst have done to me     
        but that no merit strong enough of mine
        had yielded store to thy well abled quill
        whereby t  enroll my name  as this of thine 
240     how s enriched by thy plenteous skill 
        here  then  i offer up to memory
        the value of my talent  precious man 
        whereby if thou live to posterity 
        though  be not as i would   as i can 
245       in minds from whence endeavor doth proceed 
          a ready will is taken for the deed 
        yet ere i take my longest last farewell
        from thee  fair mark of sorrow  let me frame
        some ampler work of thank  wherein to tell
250     what more thou didst deserve than in thy name 
        and free thee from the scandal of such senses
        as in the rancor of unhappy spleen
        measure thy course of life  with false pretenses
        comparing by thy death what thou hast been 
255       so in his mischiefs is the world accursed 
          it picks out matter to inform the worst 
        the willful blindness that hoodwinks the eyes
        of men enwrapped in an earthy veil
        makes them most ignorantly exercise
260     and yield to humor when it doth assail 
        whereby the candle and the body light
        darkens the inward eyesight of the mind 
        presuming still it sees  even in the night
        of that same ignorance which makes them blind 
265     hence conster they with corrupt commentaries 
        proceeding from a nature as corrupt 
        the text of malice  which so often varies
        as  by seeming reason underpropped 
        o  whither tends the lamentable spite
270     of this world teenful apprehension 
        which understands all things amiss  whose light
        shines not amidst the dark of their dissension 
        true  tis  this man  whiles yet he was a man 
        soothed not the current of besotted fashion 
275     nor could disgest  as some loose mimics can 
        an empty sound of overweening passion 
        so much to be made servant to the base
        and sensual aptness of disunioned vices 
        to purchase commendation by disgrace 
280     whereto the world and heat of sin entices 
        but in a safer contemplation 
        secure in what he knew  he ever chose
        the ready way to commendation 
        by shunning all invitements strange  of those
285     whose illness is  the necessary praise
        must wait upon their actions  only rare
        in being rare in shame  which strives to raise
        their name by doing what they do not care 
        as if the free commission of their ill
290     were even as boundless as their prompt desires 
        only like lords  like subjects to their will 
        which their fond dotage ever more admires 
        he was not so  but in a serious awe 
        ruling the little ordered commonwealth
295     of his own self  with honor to the law
        that gave peace to his bread  bread to his health 
        which ever he maintained in sweet content
        and pleasurable rest  wherein he joyed
        a monarchy of comfort government 
300     never until his last to be destroyed 
        for in the vineyard of heaven favored learning
        where he was double honored in degree 
        his observation and discreet discerning
        had taught him in both fortunes to be free 
305     whence now retired home  to a home indeed
        the home of his condition and estate 
        he well provided  the hand of need 
        whence young men sometime grow unfortunate 
        his disposition  by the bonds of unity 
310     so fastened to his reason that it strove
        with understanding grave immunity
        to purchase from all hearts a steady love 
        wherein not any one thing comprehends
        proportionable note of what he was 
315     than that he was so constant to his friends
        as he would no occasion overpass
        which might make known his unaffected care 
        in all respects of trial  to unlock
        his bosom and his store  which did declare
320     that christ was his  and he was friendship rock 
        a rock of friendship figured in his name 
        foreshowing what he was  and what should be 
        most true presage  and he discharged the same
        in every act of perfect amity 
325     though in the complemental phrase of words
        he never was addicted to the vain
        of boast  such as the common breath affords 
        he was in use most fast  in tongue most plain 
        nor amongst all those virtues that forever
330     adorned his reputation will be found
        one greater than his faith  which did persever 
        where once it was protested  alway sound 
        hence sprung the deadly fuel that revived
        the rage which wrought his end  for had he been
335     slacker in love  he had been longer lived
        and not oppressed by wrath unhappy sin     
        by wrath unhappy sin  which unadvised
        gave death for free good will  and wounds for love 
        pity it was that blood had not been prized
340     at higher rate  and reason set above
        most unjust choler  which untimely drew
        destruction on itself  and most unjust 
        robbed virtue of a follower so true
        as time can boast of  both for love and trust 
345       so henceforth all  great glory to his blood 
          shall be but seconds to him  being good 
          the wicked end their honor with their sin
          in death  which only then the good begin 
        lo  here a lesson by experience taught
350     for men whose pure simplicity hath drawn
        their trust to be betrayed by being caught
        within the snares of making truth a pawn 
        whiles it  not doubting whereinto it enters 
        without true proof and knowledge of a friend 
355     sincere in singleness of heart  adventers
        to give fit cause  ere love begin to end 
          his unfeigned friendship where it least was sought 
          him to a fatal timeless ruin brought 
        whereby the life that purity adorned
360     with real merit  by this sudden end
        is in the mouth of some in manner scorned 
        made questionable  for they do intend 
        according to the tenor of the saw
        mistook  if not observed  writ long ago
365     when men were only led by reason law 
        that  such as is the end  the life proves so 
        thus he  who to the universal lapse
        gave sweet redemption  offering up his blood
        to conquer death by death  and loose the traps
370     of hell  even in the triumph that it stood 
        he thus  for that his guiltless life was spilt
        by death  which was made subject to the curse 
        might in like manner be reproved of guilt
        in his pure life  for that his end was worse 
375     but o far be it  our unholy lips
        should so profane the deity above
        as thereby to ordain revenging whips
        against the day of judgment and of love 
        the hand that lends us honor in our days
380     may shorten when it please  and justly take
        our honor from us many sundry ways 
        as best becomes that wisdom did us make 
        the second brother  who was next begot
        of all that ever were begotten yet 
385     was by a hand in vengeance rude and hot
        sent innocent to be in heaven set 
        whose fame the angels in melodious choirs
        still witness to the world   then why should he 
        well profited in excellent desires 
390     be more rebuked  who had like destiny 
        those saints before the everlasting throne
        who sit with crowns of glory on their heads 
        washed white in blood  from earth hence have not gone
        all to their joys in quiet on their beds 
395     but tasted of the sour bitter scourge
        of torture and affliction ere they gained
        those blessings which their sufferance did urge 
        whereby the grace fore promised they attained 
        let then the false suggestions of the froward 
400     building large castles in the empty air 
        by suppositions fond and thoughts untoward
         issues of discontent and sick despair 
        rebound gross arguments upon their heart
        that may disprove their malice  and confound
405     uncivil loose opinions which insert
        their souls into the roll that doth unsound
        betraying policies  and show their brains 
        unto their shame  ridiculous  whose scope
        is envy  whose endeavors fruitless pains 
410     in nothing surely prosperous  but hope     
        and that same hope  so lame  so unprevailing 
        it buries self conceit in weak opinion 
        which being crossed  gives matter of bewailing
        their vain designs  on whom want hath dominion 
415     such  and of such condition  may devise
        which way to wound with defamation spirit
         close lurking whisper hidden forgeries 
        his taintless goodness  his desertful merit 
        but whiles the minds of men can judge sincerely 
420     upon assured knowledge  his repute
        and estimation shall be rumored clearly
        in equal worth time shall to time renew  t 
        the grave  that in his ever empty womb
        forever closes up the unrespected 
425     who when they die  die all  shall not entomb
        his pleading best perfections as neglected 
        they to his notice in succeeding years
        shall speak for him when he shall lie below 
        when nothing but his memory appears
430     of what he was  then shall his virtues grow 
        his being but a private man in rank
         and yet not ranked beneath a gentleman 
        shall not abridge the commendable thank
        which wise posterity shall give him then 
435     for nature  and his therein happy fate 
        ordained that by his quality of mind
        t  ennoble that best part  although his state
        were to a lower blessedness confined 
        blood  pomp  state  honor  glory and command 
440     without fit ornaments of disposition 
        are in themselves but heathenish and profaned 
        and much more peaceful is a mean condition
        which  underneath the roof of safe content 
        feeds on the bread of rest  and takes delight
445     to look upon the labors it hath spent
        for its own sustenance  both day and night 
        whiles others  plotting which way to be great 
        how to augment their portion and ambition 
        do toil their giddy brains  and ever sweat
450     for popular applause and power commission 
        but one in honors  like a seeled dove
        whose inward eyes are dimmed with dignity 
        does think most safety doth remain above 
        and seeks to be secure by mounting high 
455       whence  when he falls  who did erewhile aspire 
          falls deeper down  for that he climbed higher 
        now men who in lower region live
        exempt from danger of authority
        have fittest times in reason rules to thrive 
460     not vexed with envy of priority 
          and those are much more noble in the mind
          than many that have nobleness by kind 
        birth  blood  and ancestors  are none of ours 
        nor can we make a proper challenge to them
465     but virtues and perfections in our powers
        proceed most truly from us  if we do them 
        respective titles or a gracious style 
        with all what men in eminence possess 
        are  without ornaments to praise them  vile 
470     the beauty of the mind is nobleness 
        and such as have that beauty  well deserve
        eternal characters  that after death
        remembrance of their worth we may preserve 
        so that their glory die not with their breath 
475     else what avails it in a goodly strife
        upon this face of earth here to contend 
        the good t  exceed the wicked in their life 
        should both be like obscured in their end 
        until which end  there is none rightly can
480     be termed happy  since the happiness
        depends upon the goodness of the man 
        which afterwards his praises will express 
        look hither then  you that enjoy the youth
        of your best days  and see how unexpected
485     death can betray your jollity to ruth
        when death you think is least to be respected 
        the person of this model here set out
        had all that youth and happy days could give him 
        yet could not all encompass him about
490     against th  assault of death  who to relieve him
        strook home but to the frail and mortal parts
        of his humanity  but could not touch
        his flourishing and fair long lived deserts 
        above fate reach  his singleness was such 
495     so that he dies but once  but doubly lives 
        once in his proper self  then in his name 
        predestinated time  who all deprives 
        could never yet deprive him of the same 
        and had the genius which attended on him
500     been possibilited to keep him safe
        against the rigor that hath overgone him 
        he had been to the public use a staff 
        leading by his example in the path
        which guides to doing well  wherein so few
505     the proneness of this age to error hath
        informed rightly in the courses true 
        as then the loss of one  whose inclination
        stove to win love in general  is sad 
        so specially his friends  in soft compassion
510     do feel the greatest loss they could have had 
        amongst them all  she who those nine of years
        lived fellow to his counsels and his bed
        hath the most share in loss  for i in hers
        feel what distemperature this chance hath bred 
515     the chaste embracements of conjugal love 
        who in a mutual harmony consent 
        are so impatient of a strange remove
        as meager death itself seems to lament 
        and weep upon those cheeks which nature framed
520     to be delightful orbs in whom the force
        of lively sweetness plays  so that ashamed
        death often pities his unkind divorce 
        such was the separation here constrained
         well worthy to be termed a rudeness rather 
525     for in his life his love was so unfeigned
        as he was both an husband and a father     
        the one in firm affection and the other
        in careful providence  which ever strove
        with joint assistance to grace one another
530     with every helpful furtherance of love 
        but since the sum of all that can be said
        can be but said that  he was good   which wholly
        includes all excellence can be displayed
        in praise of virtue and reproach of folly 
535       his due deserts  this sentence on him gives 
           he died in life  yet in his death he lives 
        now runs the method of this doleful song
        in accents brief to thee  o thou deceased 
        to whom those pains do only all belong
540     as witnesses i did not love thee least 
        for could my worthless brain find out but how
        to raise thee from the sepulcher of dust 
        undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now
        of life with me  and heaven be counted just
545     if to a supplicating soul it would
        give life anew  by giving life again
        where life is missed  whereby discomfort should
        right his old griefs  and former joys retain
        which now with thee are leaped into thy tomb
550     and buried in that hollow vault of woe 
        expecting yet a more severer doom
        than time strict flinty hand will let  know 
        and now if i have leveled mine account
        and reckoned up in a true measured score
555     those perfect graces which were ever wont
        to wait on thee alive  i ask no more
         but shall hereafter in a poor content
        immure those imputations i sustain 
        learning my days of youth so to prevent
560     as not to be cast down by them again 
        only those hopes which fate denies to grant
        in full possession to a captive heart
        who  if it were in plenty  still would want
        before it may enjoy his better part 
565     from which detained  and banished in th  exile
        of dim misfortune  has none other prop
        whereon to lean and rest itself the while
        but the weak comfort of the hapless   hope 
        and hope must in despite of fearful change
570     play in the strongest closet of my breast 
        although perhaps i ignorantly range
        and court opinion in my deep unrest 
        but whether doth the stream of my mischance
        drive me beyond myself  fast friend  soon lost 
575     long may thy worthiness thy name advance
        amongst the virtuous and deserving most 
          who herein hast forever happy proved 
          in life thou lived st  in death thou died beloved
