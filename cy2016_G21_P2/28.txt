scene v  the tower of london 


enter mortimer  brought in a chair  and gaolers


mortimer

kind keepers of my weak decaying age 
let dying mortimer here rest himself 
even like a man new haled from the rack 
so fare my limbs with long imprisonment 
and these grey locks  the pursuivants of death 
nestor like aged in an age of care 
argue the end of edmund mortimer 
these eyes  like lamps whose wasting oil is spent 
wax dim  as drawing to their exigent 
weak shoulders  overborne with burthening grief 
and pithless arms  like to a wither vine
that droops his sapless branches to the ground 
yet are these feet  whose strengthless stay is numb 
unable to support this lump of clay 
swift winged with desire to get a grave 
as witting i no other comfort have 
but tell me  keeper  will my nephew come 


first gaoler

richard plantagenet  my lord  will come 
we sent unto the temple  unto his chamber 
and answer was return that he will come 


mortimer

enough  my soul shall then be satisfied 
poor gentleman  his wrong doth equal mine 
since henry monmouth first began to reign 
before whose glory i was great in arms 
this loathsome sequestration have i had 
and even since then hath richard been obscured 
deprived of honour and inheritance 
but now the arbitrator of despairs 
just death  kind umpire of men miseries 
with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence 
i would his troubles likewise were expired 
that so he might recover what was lost 
enter richard plantagenet


first gaoler

my lord  your loving nephew now is come 


mortimer

richard plantagenet  my friend  is he come 
richard


plantagenet

ay  noble uncle  thus ignobly used 
your nephew  late despised richard  comes 


mortimer

direct mine arms i may embrace his neck 
and in his bosom spend my latter gasp 
o  tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks 
that i may kindly give one fainting kiss 
and now declare  sweet stem from york great stock 
why didst thou say  of late thou wert despised 
richard


plantagenet

first  lean thine aged back against mine arm 
and  in that ease  i tell thee my disease 
this day  in argument upon a case 
some words there grew  somerset and me 
among which terms he used his lavish tongue
and did upbraid me with my father death 
which obloquy set bars before my tongue 
else with the like i had requited him 
therefore  good uncle  for my father sake 
in honour of a true plantagenet
and for alliance sake  declare the cause
my father  earl of cambridge  lost his head 


mortimer

that cause  fair nephew  that imprison me
and hath detain me all my flowering youth
within a loathsome dungeon  there to pine 
was cursed instrument of his decease 
richard


plantagenet

discover more at large what cause that was 
for i am ignorant and cannot guess 


mortimer

i will  if that my fading breath permit
and death approach not ere my tale be done 
henry the fourth  grandfather to this king 
deposed his nephew richard  edward son 
the first begotten and the lawful heir 
of edward king  the third of that descent 
during whose reign the percies of the north 
finding his usurpation most unjust 
endeavor my advancement to the throne 
the reason moved these warlike lords to this
was  for that young king richard thus removed 
leaving no heir begotten of his body 
i was the next by birth and parentage 
for by my mother i derived am
from lionel duke of clarence  the third son
to king edward the third  whereas he
from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree 
being but fourth of that heroic line 
but mark  as in this haughty attempt
they laboured to plant the rightful heir 
i lost my liberty and they their lives 
long after this  when henry the fifth 
succeeding his father bolingbroke  did reign 
thy father  earl of cambridge  then derived
from famous edmund langley  duke of york 
marrying my sister that thy mother was 
again in pity of my hard distress
levied an army  weening to redeem
and have install me in the diadem 
but  as the rest  so fell that noble earl
and was beheaded  thus the mortimers 
in whom the tide rested  were suppress d 
richard


plantagenet

of which  my lord  your honour is the last 


mortimer

true  and thou seest that i no issue have
and that my fainting words do warrant death 
thou art my heir  the rest i wish thee gather 
but yet be wary in thy studious care 
richard


plantagenet

thy grave admonishments prevail with me 
but yet  methinks  my father execution
was nothing less than bloody tyranny 


mortimer

with silence  nephew  be thou politic 
strong fixed is the house of lancaster 
and like a mountain  not to be removed 
but now thy uncle is removing hence 
as princes do their courts  when they are cloy 
with long continuance in a settled place 
richard


plantagenet

o  uncle  would some part of my young years
might but redeem the passage of your age 


mortimer

thou dost then wrong me  as that slaughterer doth
which giveth many wounds when one will kill 
mourn not  except thou sorrow for my good 
only give order for my funeral 
and so farewell  and fair be all thy hopes
and prosperous be thy life in peace and war 
dies
richard


plantagenet

and peace  no war  befall thy parting soul 
in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
and like a hermit overpass thy days 
well  i will lock his counsel in my breast 
and what i do imagine let that rest 
keepers  convey him hence  and i myself
will see his burial better than his life 
exeunt gaolers  bearing out the body of mortimer
here dies the dusky torch of mortimer 
choked with ambition of the meaner sort 
and for those wrongs  those bitter injuries 
which somerset hath offer to my house 
i doubt not but with honour to redress 
and therefore haste i to the parliament 
either to be restored to my blood 
or make my ill the advantage of my good 
exit
