exeunt carriers


gadshill

what  ho  chamberlain 


chamberlain

 within   at hand  quoth pick purse 


gadshill

that even as fair as at hand  quoth the
chamberlain  for thou variest no more from picking
of purses than giving direction doth from labouring 
thou layest the plot how 
enter chamberlain


chamberlain

good morrow  master gadshill  it holds current that
i told you yesternight  there a franklin in the
wild of kent hath brought three hundred marks with
him in gold  i heard him tell it to one of his
company last night at supper  a kind of auditor  one
that hath abundance of charge too  god knows what 
they are up already  and call for eggs and butter 
they will away presently 


gadshill

sirrah  if they meet not with saint nicholas 
clerks  i give thee this neck 


chamberlain

no  i none of it  i pray thee keep that for the
hangman  for i know thou worshippest st  nicholas
as truly as a man of falsehood may 


gadshill

what talkest thou to me of the hangman  if i hang 
i make a fat pair of gallows  for if i hang  old
sir john hangs with me  and thou knowest he is no
starveling  tut  there are other trojans that thou
dreamest not of  the which for sport sake are
content to do the profession some grace  that would 
if matters should be looked into  for their own
credit sake  make all whole  i am joined with no
foot land rakers  no long staff sixpenny strikers 
none of these mad mustachio purple hued malt worms 
but with nobility and tranquillity  burgomasters and
great oneyers  such as can hold in  such as will
strike sooner than speak  and speak sooner than
drink  and drink sooner than pray  and yet  zounds 
i lie  for they pray continually to their saint  the
commonwealth  or rather  not pray to her  but prey
on her  for they ride up and down on her and make
her their boots 


chamberlain

what  the commonwealth their boots  will she hold
out water in foul way 


gadshill

she will  she will  justice hath liquored her  we
steal as in a castle  cocksure  we have the receipt
of fern seed  we walk invisible 


chamberlain

nay  by my faith  i think you are more beholding to
the night than to fern seed for your walking invisible 


gadshill

give me thy hand  thou shalt have a share in our
purchase  as i am a true man 


chamberlain

nay  rather let me have it  as you are a false thief 


gadshill

go to   homo  is a common name to all men  bid the
ostler bring my gelding out of the stable  farewell 
you muddy knave 
exeunt
