joan la pucelle

these are the city gates  the gates of rouen 
through which our policy must make a breach 
take heed  be wary how you place your words 
talk like the vulgar sort of market men
that come to gather money for their corn 
if we have entrance  as i hope we shall 
and that we find the slothful watch but weak 
i by a sign give notice to our friends 
that charles the dauphin may encounter them 


first soldier

our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city 
and we be lords and rulers over rouen 
therefore we knock 
knocks

and once again we sleep secure in rouen 


bastard of orleans

here enter pucelle and her practisants 
now she is there  how will she specify
where is the best and safest passage in 


reignier

by thrusting out a torch from yonder tower 
which  once discern d  shows that her meaning is 
no way to that  for weakness  which she enter d 
enter joan la pucelle on the top  thrusting out a torch burning


joan la pucelle

behold  this is the happy wedding torch
that joineth rouen unto her countrymen 
but burning fatal to the talbotites

before he buy again at such a rate 
 full of darnel  do you like the taste 


burgundy

scoff on  vile fiend and shameless courtezan 
i trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
and make thee curse the harvest of that corn 


charles

your grace may starve perhaps before that time 


bedford

o  let no words  but deeds  revenge this treason 


joan la pucelle

what will you do  good grey beard  break a lance 
and run a tilt at death within a chair 


talbot

foul fiend of france  and hag of all despite 
encompass with thy lustful paramours 
becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
and twit with cowardice a man half dead 
damsel  i have a bout with you again 
or else let talbot perish with this shame 


joan la pucelle

are ye so hot  sir  yet  pucelle  hold thy peace 
if talbot do but thunder  rain will follow 
the english whisper together in council
god speed the parliament  who shall be the speaker 


talbot

dare ye come forth and meet us in the field 


joan la pucelle

belike your lordship takes us then for fools 
to try if that our own be ours or no 


talbot

i speak not to that railing hecate 
but unto thee  alencon  and the rest 
will ye  like soldiers  come and fight it out 


alencon

signior  no 


talbot

signior  hang  base muleters of france 
like peasant foot boys do they keep the walls
and dare not take up arms like gentlemen 


joan la pucelle

away  captains  let get us from the walls 
for talbot means no goodness by his looks 
god be wi  you  my lord  we came but to tell you
that we are here 
exeunt from the walls


talbot

and there will we be too  ere it be long 
or else reproach be talbot greatest fame 
vow  burgundy  by honour of thy house 
prick on by public wrongs sustain in france 
either to get the town again or die 
and i  as sure as english henry lives
and as his father here was conqueror 
as sure as in this late betrayed town
great coeur de lion heart was buried 
so sure i swear to get the town or die 


burgundy

my vows are equal partners with thy vows 


talbot

but  ere we go  regard this dying prince 
the valiant duke of bedford  come  my lord 
we will bestow you in some better place 
fitter for sickness and for crazy age 


bedford

lord talbot  do not so dishonour me 
here will i sit before the walls of rouen
and will be partner of your weal or woe 


burgundy

courageous bedford  let us now persuade you 


bedford

not to be gone from hence  for once i read
that stout pendragon in his litter sick
came to the field and vanquished his foes 
methinks i should revive the soldiers  hearts 
because i ever found them as myself 


talbot

undaunted spirit in a dying breast 
then be it so  heavens keep old bedford safe 
and now no more ado  brave burgundy 
but gather we our forces out of hand
and set upon our boasting enemy 
exeunt all but bedford and attendants
an alarum  excursions  enter fastolfe and a captain


captain

whither away  sir john fastolfe  in such haste 


fastolfe

whither away  to save myself by flight 
we are like to have the overthrow again 


captain

what  will you fly  and leave lord talbot 


fastolfe

ay 
all the talbots in the world  to save my life 
exit


captain

cowardly knight  ill fortune follow thee 
exit
retreat  excursions  joan la pucelle  alencon  and charles fly


bedford

now  quiet soul  depart when heaven please 
for i have seen our enemies  overthrow 
what is the trust or strength of foolish man 
they that of late were daring with their scoffs
are glad and fain by flight to save themselves 
bedford dies  and is carried in by two in his chair
an alarum  re enter talbot  burgundy  and the rest


talbot

lost  and recover in a day again 
this is a double honour  burgundy 
yet heavens have glory for this victory 


burgundy

warlike and martial talbot  burgundy
enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
thy noble deeds as valour monuments 


talbot

thanks  gentle duke  but where is pucelle now 
i think her old familiar is asleep 
now where the bastard braves  and charles his gleeks 
what  all amort  rouen hangs her head for grief
that such a valiant company are fled 
now will we take some order in the town 
placing therein some expert officers 
and then depart to paris to the king 
for there young henry with his nobles lie 


burgundy

what wills lord talbot pleaseth burgundy 


talbot

but yet  before we go  let not forget
the noble duke of bedford late deceased 
but see his exequies fulfill in rouen 
a braver soldier never couched lance 
a gentler heart did never sway in court 
but kings and mightiest potentates must die 
for that the end of human misery
