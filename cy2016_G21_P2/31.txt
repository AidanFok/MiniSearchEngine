enter charles  the bastard of orleans  alencon  joan la pucelle  and forces


joan la pucelle

dismay not  princes  at this accident 
nor grieve that rouen is so recovered 
care is no cure  but rather corrosive 
for things that are not to be remedied 
let frantic talbot triumph for a while
and like a peacock sweep along his tail 
we pull his plumes and take away his train 
if dauphin and the rest will be but ruled 


charles

we have been guided by thee hitherto 
and of thy cunning had no diffidence 
one sudden foil shall never breed distrust 


bastard of orleans

search out thy wit for secret policies 
and we will make thee famous through the world 


alencon

we set thy statue in some holy place 
and have thee reverenced like a blessed saint 
employ thee then  sweet virgin  for our good 


joan la pucelle

then thus it must be  this doth joan devise 
by fair persuasions mix with sugar words
we will entice the duke of burgundy
to leave the talbot and to follow us 


charles

ay  marry  sweeting  if we could do that 
france were no place for henry warriors 
nor should that nation boast it so with us 
but be extirped from our provinces 


alencon

for ever should they be expulsed from france
and not have title of an earldom here 


joan la pucelle

your honours shall perceive how i will work
to bring this matter to the wished end 
drum sounds afar off
hark  by the sound of drum you may perceive
their powers are marching unto paris ward 
here sound an english march  enter  and pass over at a distance  talbot and his forces
there goes the talbot  with his colours spread 
and all the troops of english after him 
french march  enter burgundy and forces
now in the rearward comes the duke and his 
fortune in favour makes him lag behind 
summon a parley  we will talk with him 
trumpets sound a parley


charles

a parley with the duke of burgundy 


burgundy

who craves a parley with the burgundy 


joan la pucelle

the princely charles of france  thy countryman 


burgundy

what say thou  charles  for i am marching hence 


charles

speak  pucelle  and enchant him with thy words 


joan la pucelle

brave burgundy  undoubted hope of france 
stay  let thy humble handmaid speak to thee 


burgundy

speak on  but be not over tedious 


joan la pucelle

look on thy country  look on fertile france 
and see the cities and the towns defaced
by wasting ruin of the cruel foe 
as looks the mother on her lowly babe
when death doth close his tender dying eyes 
see  see the pining malady of france 
behold the wounds  the most unnatural wounds 
which thou thyself hast given her woful breast 
o  turn thy edged sword another way 
strike those that hurt  and hurt not those that help 
one drop of blood drawn from thy country bosom
should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore 
return thee therefore with a flood of tears 
and wash away thy country stained spots 


burgundy

either she hath bewitch me with her words 
or nature makes me suddenly relent 


joan la pucelle

besides  all french and france exclaims on thee 
doubting thy birth and lawful progeny 
who joint thou with but with a lordly nation
that will not trust thee but for profit sake 
when talbot hath set footing once in france
and fashion thee that instrument of ill 
who then but english henry will be lord
and thou be thrust out like a fugitive 
call we to mind  and mark but this for proof 
was not the duke of orleans thy foe 
and was he not in england prisoner 
but when they heard he was thine enemy 
they set him free without his ransom paid 
in spite of burgundy and all his friends 
see  then  thou fight against thy countrymen
and joint with them will be thy slaughtermen 
come  come  return  return  thou wandering lord 
charles and the rest will take thee in their arms 


burgundy

i am vanquished  these haughty words of hers
have batter me like roaring cannon shot 
and made me almost yield upon my knees 
forgive me  country  and sweet countrymen 
and  lords  accept this hearty kind embrace 
my forces and my power of men are yours 
so farewell  talbot  i no longer trust thee 


joan la pucelle

 aside   done like a frenchman  turn  and turn again 


charles

welcome  brave duke  thy friendship makes us fresh 


bastard of orleans

and doth beget new courage in our breasts 


alencon

pucelle hath bravely play her part in this 
and doth deserve a coronet of gold 


charles

now let us on  my lords  and join our powers 
and seek how we may prejudice the foe
