what  has this thing appear again to night 


bernardo

i have seen nothing 


marcellus

horatio says  but our fantasy 
and will not let belief take hold of him
touching this dreaded sight  twice seen of us 
therefore i have entreated him along
with us to watch the minutes of this night 
that if again this apparition come 
he may approve our eyes and speak to it 


horatio

tush  tush   not appear 


bernardo

sit down awhile 
and let us once again assail your ears 
that are so fortified against our story
what we have two nights seen 


horatio

well  sit we down 
and let us hear bernardo speak of this 


bernardo

last night of all 
when yond same star that westward from the pole
had made his course to illume that part of heaven
where now it burns  marcellus and myself 
the bell then beating one 
enter ghost


marcellus

peace  break thee off  look  where it comes again 


bernardo

in the same figure  like the king that dead 


marcellus

thou art a scholar  speak to it  horatio 


bernardo

looks it not like the king   mark it  horatio 


horatio

most like  it harrows me with fear and wonder 


bernardo

it would be spoke to 


marcellus

question it  horatio 


horatio

what art thou that usurp this time of night 
together with that fair and warlike form
in which the majesty of buried denmark
did sometimes march  by heaven i charge thee  speak 


marcellus

it is offended 


bernardo

                  see  it stalks away 


horatio

stay  speak  speak  i charge thee  speak 
exit ghost


marcellus

 gone  and will not answer 


bernardo

how now  horatio  you tremble and look pale 
is not this something more than fantasy 
what think you on t 


horatio

before my god  i might not this believe
without the sensible and true avouch
of mine own eyes 


marcellus

                  is it not like the king 


horatio

as thou art to thyself 
such was the very armour he had on
when he the ambitious norway combated 
so frown he once  when  in an angry parle 
he smote the sledded polacks on the ice 
 strange 


marcellus

thus twice before  and jump at this dead hour 
with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch 


horatio

in what particular thought to work i know not 
but in the gross and scope of my opinion 
this bodes some strange eruption to our state 


marcellus

good now  sit down  and tell me  he that knows 
why this same strict and most observant watch
so nightly toils the subject of the land 
and why such daily cast of brazen cannon 
and foreign mart for implements of war 
why such impress of shipwrights  whose sore task
does not divide the sunday from the week 
what might be toward  that this sweaty haste
doth make the night joint labourer with the day 
who is that can inform me 


horatio

that can i 
at least  the whisper goes so  our last king 
whose image even but now appear to us 
was  as you know  by fortinbras of norway 
thereto prick on by a most emulate pride 
dared to the combat  in which our valiant hamlet 
for so this side of our known world esteem him 
did slay this fortinbras  who by a seal compact 
well ratified by law and heraldry 
did forfeit  with his life  all those his lands
which he stood seized of  to the conqueror 
against the which  a moiety competent
was gaged by our king  which had return 
to the inheritance of fortinbras 
had he been vanquisher  as  by the same covenant 
and carriage of the article design d 
his fell to hamlet  now  sir  young fortinbras 
of unimproved mettle hot and full 
hath in the skirts of norway here and there
shark up a list of lawless resolutes 
for food and diet  to some enterprise
that hath a stomach in t  which is no other 
as it doth well appear unto our state 
but to recover of us  by strong hand
and terms compulsatory  those foresaid lands
so by his father lost  and this  i take it 
is the main motive of our preparations 
the source of this our watch and the chief head
of this post haste and romage in the land 


bernardo

i think it be no other but e so 
well may it sort that this portentous figure
comes armed through our watch  so like the king
that was and is the question of these wars 


horatio

a mote it is to trouble the mind eye 
in the most high and palmy state of rome 
a little ere the mightiest julius fell 
the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber in the roman streets 
as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood 
disasters in the sun  and the moist star
upon whose influence neptune empire stands
was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse 
and even the like precurse of fierce events 
as harbingers preceding still the fates
and prologue to the omen coming on 
have heaven and earth together demonstrated
unto our climatures and countrymen 
but soft  behold  lo  where it comes again 
re enter ghost
i cross it  though it blast me  stay  illusion 
if thou hast any sound  or use of voice 
speak to me 
if there be any good thing to be done 
that may to thee do ease and grace to me 
speak to me 
cock crows
if thou art privy to thy country fate 
which  happily  foreknowing may avoid  o  speak 
or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
extorted treasure in the womb of earth 
for which  they say  you spirits oft walk in death 
speak of it  stay  and speak  stop it  marcellus 


marcellus

shall i strike at it with my partisan 


horatio

do  if it will not stand 


bernardo

 here 


horatio

 here 


marcellus

 gone 
exit ghost
we do it wrong  being so majestical 
to offer it the show of violence 
for it is  as the air  invulnerable 
and our vain blows malicious mockery 


bernardo

it was about to speak  when the cock crew 


horatio

and then it started like a guilty thing
upon a fearful summons  i have heard 
the cock  that is the trumpet to the morn 
doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat
awake the god of day  and  at his warning 
whether in sea or fire  in earth or air 
the extravagant and erring spirit hies
to his confine  and of the truth herein
this present object made probation 


marcellus

it faded on the crowing of the cock 
some say that ever  that season comes
wherein our saviour birth is celebrated 
the bird of dawning singeth all night long 
and then  they say  no spirit dares stir abroad 
the nights are wholesome  then no planets strike 
no fairy takes  nor witch hath power to charm 
so hallow and so gracious is the time 


horatio

so have i heard and do in part believe it 
but  look  the morn  in russet mantle clad 
walks o the dew of yon high eastward hill 
break we our watch up  and by my advice 
let us impart what we have seen to night
unto young hamlet  for  upon my life 
this spirit  dumb to us  will speak to him 
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it 
as needful in our loves  fitting our duty 


marcellus

let do t  i pray  and i this morning know
where we shall find him most conveniently 
exeunt
