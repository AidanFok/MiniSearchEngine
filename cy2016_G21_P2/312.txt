though yet of hamlet our dear brother death
the memory be green  and that it us befitted
to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
to be contracted in one brow of woe 
yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
that we with wisest sorrow think on him 
together with remembrance of ourselves 
therefore our sometime sister  now our queen 
the imperial jointress to this warlike state 
have we  as  with a defeated joy 
with an auspicious and a dropping eye 
with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage 
in equal scale weighing delight and dole 
taken to wife  nor have we herein barr 
your better wisdoms  which have freely gone
with this affair along  for all  our thanks 
now follows  that you know  young fortinbras 
holding a weak supposal of our worth 
or thinking by our late dear brother death
our state to be disjoint and out of frame 
colleagued with the dream of his advantage 
he hath not fail to pester us with message 
importing the surrender of those lands
lost by his father  with all bonds of law 
to our most valiant brother  so much for him 
now for ourself and for this time of meeting 
thus much the business is  we have here writ
to norway  uncle of young fortinbras 
who  impotent and bed rid  scarcely hears
of this his nephew purpose to suppress
his further gait herein  in that the levies 
the lists and full proportions  are all made
out of his subject  and we here dispatch
you  good cornelius  and you  voltimand 
for bearers of this greeting to old norway 
giving to you no further personal power
to business with the king  more than the scope
of these delated articles allow 
farewell  and let your haste commend your duty 


cornelius

voltimand

in that and all things will we show our duty 


king claudius

we doubt it nothing  heartily farewell 
exeunt voltimand and cornelius
and now  laertes  what the news with you 
you told us of some suit  what is t  laertes 
you cannot speak of reason to the dane 
and loose your voice  what wouldst thou beg  laertes 
that shall not be my offer  not thy asking 
the head is not more native to the heart 
the hand more instrumental to the mouth 
than is the throne of denmark to thy father 
what wouldst thou have  laertes 


laertes

my dread lord 
your leave and favour to return to france 
from whence though willingly i came to denmark 
to show my duty in your coronation 
yet now  i must confess  that duty done 
my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france
and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon 


king claudius

have you your father leave  what says polonius 


lord polonius

he hath  my lord  wrung from me my slow leave
by laboursome petition  and at last
upon his will i seal my hard consent 
i do beseech you  give him leave to go 


king claudius

take thy fair hour  laertes  time be thine 
and thy best graces spend it at thy will 
but now  my cousin hamlet  and my son 


hamlet

 aside   a little more than kin  and less than kind 


king claudius

how is it that the clouds still hang on you 


hamlet

not so  my lord  i am too much i  the sun 


queen gertrude

good hamlet  cast thy nighted colour off 
and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark 
do not for ever with thy vailed lids
seek for thy noble father in the dust 
thou know common  all that lives must die 
passing through nature to eternity 


hamlet

ay  madam  it is common 


queen gertrude

if it be 
why seems it so particular with thee 


hamlet

seems  madam  nay it is  i know not  seems 
 not alone my inky cloak  good mother 
nor customary suits of solemn black 
nor windy suspiration of forced breath 
no  nor the fruitful river in the eye 
nor the dejected  of the visage 
together with all forms  moods  shapes of grief 
that can denote me truly  these indeed seem 
for they are actions that a man might play 
but i have that within which passeth show 
these but the trappings and the suits of woe 


king claudius

 sweet and commendable in your nature  hamlet 
to give these mourning duties to your father 
but  you must know  your father lost a father 
that father lost  lost his  and the survivor bound
in filial obligation for some term
to do obsequious sorrow  but to persever
in obstinate condolement is a course
of impious stubbornness   unmanly grief 
it shows a will most incorrect to heaven 
a heart unfortified  a mind impatient 
an understanding simple and unschool d 
for what we know must be and is as common
as any the most vulgar thing to sense 
why should we in our peevish opposition
take it to heart  fie   a fault to heaven 
a fault against the dead  a fault to nature 
to reason most absurd  whose common theme
is death of fathers  and who still hath cried 
from the first corse till he that died to day 
 must be so  we pray you  throw to earth
this unprevailing woe  and think of us
as of a father  for let the world take note 
you are the most immediate to our throne 
and with no less nobility of love
than that which dearest father bears his son 
do i impart toward you  for your intent
in going back to school in wittenberg 
it is most retrograde to our desire 
and we beseech you  bend you to remain
here  in the cheer and comfort of our eye 
our chiefest courtier  cousin  and our son 


queen gertrude

let not thy mother lose her prayers  hamlet 
i pray thee  stay with us  go not to wittenberg 


hamlet

i shall in all my best obey you  madam 


king claudius

why   a loving and a fair reply 
be as ourself in denmark  madam  come 
this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet
sits smiling to my heart  in grace whereof 
no jocund health that denmark drinks to day 
but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell 
and the king rouse the heavens all bruit again 
re speaking earthly thunder  come away 
exeunt all but hamlet


hamlet

o  that this too too solid flesh would melt
thaw and resolve itself into a dew 
or that the everlasting had not fix 
his canon  self slaughter  o god  god 
how weary  stale  flat and unprofitable 
seem to me all the uses of this world 
fie on t  ah fie   an unweeded garden 
that grows to seed  things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely  that it should come to this 
but two months dead  nay  not so much  not two 
so excellent a king  that was  to this 
hyperion to a satyr  so loving to my mother
that he might not beteem the winds of heaven
visit her face too roughly  heaven and earth 
must i remember  why  she would hang on him 
as if increase of appetite had grown
by what it fed on  and yet  within a month 
let me not think on t frailty  thy name is woman 
a little month  or ere those shoes were old
with which she follow my poor father body 
like niobe  all tears why she  even she 
o  god  a beast  that wants discourse of reason 
would have mourn longer married with my uncle 
my father brother  but no more like my father
than i to hercules  within a month 
ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
had left the flushing in her galled eyes 
she married  o  most wicked speed  to post
with such dexterity to incestuous sheets 
it is not nor it cannot come to good 
but break  my heart  for i must hold my tongue 
enter horatio  marcellus  and bernardo

horatio

two nights together had these gentlemen 
marcellus and bernardo  on their watch 
in the dead vast and middle of the night 
been thus encounter d  a figure like your father 
armed at point exactly  cap a pe 
appears before them  and with solemn march
goes slow and stately by them  thrice he walk 
by their oppress and fear surprised eyes 
within his truncheon length  whilst they  distilled
almost to jelly with the act of fear 
stand dumb and speak not to him  this to me
in dreadful secrecy impart they did 
and i with them the third night kept the watch 
where  as they had deliver d  both in time 
form of the thing  each word made true and good 
the apparition comes  i knew your father 
these hands are not more like 


hamlet

but where was this 


marcellus

my lord  upon the platform where we watch d 


hamlet

did you not speak to it 


horatio

my lord  i did 
but answer made it none  yet once methought
it lifted up its head and did address
itself to motion  like as it would speak 
but even then the morning cock crew loud 
and at the sound it shrunk in haste away 
and vanish from our sight 


hamlet

 very strange 


horatio

as i do live  my honour lord   true 
and we did think it writ down in our duty
to let you know of it 


hamlet

indeed  indeed  sirs  but this troubles me 
hold you the watch to night

horatio

o  yes  my lord  he wore his beaver up 


hamlet

hamlet

pale or red 


horatio

longer  longer

i speak to it  though hell itself should gape
and bid me hold my peace  i pray you all
