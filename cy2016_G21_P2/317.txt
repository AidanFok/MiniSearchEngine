scene iv  the platform 


enter hamlet  horatio  and marcellus


hamlet

the air bites shrewdly  it is very cold 


horatio

it is a nipping and an eager air 


hamlet

what hour now 


horatio

                  i think it lacks of twelve 


hamlet

no  it is struck 


horatio

indeed  i heard it not  then it draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk 
a flourish of trumpets  and ordnance shot off  within
what does this mean  my lord 


hamlet

the king doth wake to night and takes his rouse 
keeps wassail  and the swaggering up spring reels 
and  as he drains his draughts of rhenish down 
the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out
the triumph of his pledge 


horatio

is it a custom 


hamlet

ay  marry  is t 
but to my mind  though i am native here
and to the manner born  it is a custom
more honour in the breach than the observance 
this heavy headed revel east and west
makes us traduced and tax of other nations 
they clepe us drunkards  and with swinish phrase
soil our addition  and indeed it takes
from our achievements  though perform at height 
the pith and marrow of our attribute 
so  oft it chances in particular men 
that for some vicious mole of nature in them 
as  in their birth wherein they are not guilty 
since nature cannot choose his origin 
by the o of some complexion 
oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason 
or by some habit that too much o er leavens
the form of plausive manners  that these men 
carrying  i say  the stamp of one defect 
being nature livery  or fortune star 
their virtues else be they as pure as grace 
as infinite as man may undergo 
shall in the general censure take corruption
from that particular fault  the dram of eale
doth all the noble substance of a doubt
to his own scandal 


horatio

look  my lord  it comes 
enter ghost


hamlet

angels and ministers of grace defend us 
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn d 
bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell 
be thy intents wicked or charitable 
thou comest in such a questionable shape
that i will speak to thee  i call thee hamlet 
king  father  royal dane  o  answer me 
let me not burst in ignorance  but tell
why thy canonized bones  hearsed in death 
have burst their cerements  why the sepulchre 
wherein we saw thee quietly inurn d 
hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws 
to cast thee up again  what may this mean 
that thou  dead corse  again in complete steel
revisit thus the glimpses of the moon 
making night hideous  and we fools of nature
so horridly to shake our disposition
with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls 
say  why is this  wherefore  what should we do 
ghost beckons hamlet


horatio

it beckons you to go away with it 
as if it some impartment did desire
to you alone 


marcellus

                  look  with what courteous action
it waves you to a more removed ground 
but do not go with it 


horatio

no  by no means 


hamlet

it will not speak  then i will follow it 


horatio

do not  my lord 


hamlet

                  why  what should be the fear 
i do not set my life in a pin fee 
and for my soul  what can it do to that 
being a thing immortal as itself 
it waves me forth again  i follow it 


horatio

what if it tempt you toward the flood  my lord 
or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
that beetles o his base into the sea 
and there assume some other horrible form 
which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
and draw you into madness  think of it 
the very place puts toys of desperation 
without more motive  into every brain
that looks so many fathoms to the sea
and hears it roar beneath 


hamlet

it waves me still 
go on  i follow thee 


marcellus

you shall not go  my lord 


hamlet

hold off your hands 


horatio

be ruled  you shall not go 


hamlet

my fate cries out 
and makes each petty artery in this body
as hardy as the nemean lion nerve 
still am i call d  unhand me  gentlemen 
by heaven  i make a ghost of him that lets me 
i say  away  go on  i follow thee 
exeunt ghost and hamlet


horatio

he waxes desperate with imagination 


marcellus

let follow   not fit thus to obey him 


horatio

have after  to what issue will this come 


marcellus

something is rotten in the state of denmark 


horatio

heaven will direct it 


marcellus

nay  let follow him 
exeunt
