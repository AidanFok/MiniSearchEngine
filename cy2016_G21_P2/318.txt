hamlet

where wilt thou lead me  speak  i go no further 


ghost

mark me 


hamlet

       i will 


ghost

                  my hour is almost come 
when i to sulphurous and tormenting flames
must render up myself 


hamlet

alas  poor ghost 


ghost

pity me not  but lend thy serious hearing
to what i shall unfold 


hamlet

speak  i am bound to hear 


ghost

 so art thou to revenge  when thou shalt hear 


hamlet

what 


ghost

i am thy father spirit 
doom for a certain term to walk the night 
and for the day confined to fast in fires 
till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
are burnt and purged away  but that i am forbid
to tell the secrets of my prison house 
i could a tale unfold whose lightest word
would harrow up thy soul  freeze thy young blood 
make thy two eyes  like stars  start from their spheres 
thy knotted and combined locks to part
and each particular hair to stand on end 
like quills upon the fretful porpentine 
but this eternal blazon must not be
to ears of flesh and blood  list  list  o  list 
if thou didst ever thy dear father love 


hamlet

o god 


ghost

revenge his foul and most unnatural murder 


hamlet

murder 


ghost

murder most foul  as in the best it is 
but this most foul  strange and unnatural 


hamlet

haste me to know t  that i  with wings as swift
as meditation or the thoughts of love 
may sweep to my revenge 


ghost

i find thee apt 
and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf 
wouldst thou not stir in this  now  hamlet  hear 
 given out that  sleeping in my orchard 
a serpent stung me  so the whole ear of denmark
is by a forged process of my death
rankly abused  but know  thou noble youth 
the serpent that did sting thy father life
now wears his crown 


hamlet

o my prophetic soul  my uncle 


ghost

ay  that incestuous  that adulterate beast 
with witchcraft of his wit  with traitorous gifts 
o wicked wit and gifts  that have the power
so to seduce won to his shameful lust
the will of my most seeming virtuous queen 
o hamlet  what a falling off was there 
from me  whose love was of that dignity
that it went hand in hand even with the vow
i made to her in marriage  and to decline
upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
to those of mine 
but virtue  as it never will be moved 
though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven 
so lust  though to a radiant angel link d 
will sate itself in a celestial bed 
and prey on garbage 
but  soft  methinks i scent the morning air 
brief let me be  sleeping within my orchard 
my custom always of the afternoon 
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole 
with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial 
and in the porches of my ears did pour
the leperous distilment  whose effect
holds such an enmity with blood of man
that swift as quicksilver it courses through
the natural gates and alleys of the body 
and with a sudden vigour doth posset
and curd  like eager droppings into milk 
the thin and wholesome blood  so did it mine 
and a most instant tetter bark about 
most lazar like  with vile and loathsome crust 
all my smooth body 
thus was i  sleeping  by a brother hand
of life  of crown  of queen  at once dispatch d 
cut off even in the blossoms of my sin 
unhousel d  disappointed  unanel d 
no reckoning made  but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head 
o  horrible  o  horrible  most horrible 
if thou hast nature in thee  bear it not 
let not the royal bed of denmark be
a couch for luxury and damned incest 
but  howsoever thou pursuest this act 
taint not thy mind  nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught  leave her to heaven
and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge 
to prick and sting her  fare thee well at once 
the glow worm shows the matin to be near 
and  to pale his uneffectual fire 
adieu  adieu  hamlet  remember me 
exit


hamlet

o all you host of heaven  o earth  what else 
and shall i couple hell  o  fie  hold  hold  my heart 
and you  my sinews  grow not instant old 
but bear me stiffly up  remember thee 
ay  thou poor ghost  while memory holds a seat
in this distracted globe  remember thee 
yea  from the table of my memory
i wipe away all trivial fond records 
all saws of books  all forms  all pressures past 
that youth and observation copied there 
and thy commandment all alone shall live
within the book and volume of my brain 
unmix with baser matter  yes  by heaven 
o most pernicious woman 
o villain  villain  smiling  damned villain 
my tables meet it is i set it down 
that one may smile  and smile  and be a villain 
at least i sure it may be so in denmark 
writing
so  uncle  there you are  now to my word 
it is  adieu  adieu  remember me 
i have sworn  t 


marcellus

horatio

but you be secret 


horatio

marcellus

ay  by heaven  my lord 


hamlet

there ne a villain dwelling in all denmark
but he an arrant knave 


horatio

there needs no ghost  my lord  come from the grave
to tell us this 


hamlet

                  why  right  you are i  the right 
and so  without more circumstance at all 
i hold it fit that we shake hands and part 
you  as your business and desire shall point you 
for every man has business and desire 
such as it is  and for mine own poor part 
look you  i go pray 


horatio

these are but wild and whirling words  my lord 


hamlet

i sorry they offend you  heartily 
yes   heartily 


horatio

there no offence  my lord 


hamlet

yes  by saint patrick  but there is  horatio 
and much offence too  touching this vision here 
it is an honest ghost  that let me tell you 
for your desire to know what is between us 
o as you may  and now  good friends 
as you are friends  scholars and soldiers 
give me one poor request 


horatio

what is t  my lord  we will 


hamlet

never make known what you have seen to night 


horatio

marcellus

my lord  we will not 


hamlet

nay  but swear t 


horatio

in faith 
my lord  not i 


marcellus

                  nor i  my lord  in faith 


hamlet

upon my sword 


marcellus

                  we have sworn  my lord  already 


hamlet

indeed  upon my sword  indeed 


ghost

 beneath   swear 


hamlet

ah  ha  boy  say thou so  art thou there 
truepenny 
come on you hear this fellow in the cellarage 
consent to swear 


horatio

                  propose the oath  my lord 


hamlet

never to speak of this that you have seen 
swear by my sword 


ghost

 beneath   swear 


hamlet

hic et ubique  then we shift our ground 
come hither  gentlemen 
and lay your hands again upon my sword 
never to speak of this that you have heard 
swear by my sword 


ghost

 beneath   swear 


hamlet

well said  old mole  canst work i  the earth so fast 
a worthy pioner  once more remove  good friends 


horatio

o day and night  but this is wondrous strange 


hamlet

and therefore as a stranger give it welcome 
there are more things in heaven and earth  horatio 
than are dreamt of in your philosophy  but come 
here  as before  never  so help you mercy 
how strange or odd soe i bear myself 
as i perchance hereafter shall think meet
to put an antic disposition on 
that you  at such times seeing me  never shall 
with arms encumber thus  or this headshake 
or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase 
as  well  well  we know  or  could  an if we would 
or  we list to speak  or  be  an if they might 
or such ambiguous giving out  to note
that you know aught of me  this not to do 
so grace and mercy at your most need help you  swear 


ghost

 beneath   swear 


hamlet

rest  rest  perturbed spirit 
they swear
so  gentlemen 
with all my love i do commend me to you 
and what so poor a man as hamlet is
may do  to express his love and friending to you 
god willing  shall not lack  let us go in together 
and still your fingers on your lips  i pray 
the time is out of joint  o cursed spite 
that ever i was born to set it right 
nay  come  let go together
