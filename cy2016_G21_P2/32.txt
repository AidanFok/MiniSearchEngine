my gracious prince  and honourable peers 
hearing of your arrival in this realm 
i have awhile given truce unto my wars 
to do my duty to my sovereign 
in sign  whereof  this arm  that hath reclaim 
to your obedience fifty fortresses 
twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength 
beside five hundred prisoners of esteem 
lets fall his sword before your highness  feet 
and with submissive loyalty of heart
ascribes the glory of his conquest got
first to my god and next unto your grace 
kneels

king henry vi

welcome  brave captain and victorious lord 
when i was young  as yet i am not old 
i do remember how my father said
a stouter champion never handled sword 
long since we were resolved of your truth 
your faithful service and your toil in war 
yet never have you tasted our reward 
or been reguerdon with so much as thanks 
because till now we never saw your face 
therefore  stand up  and  for these good deserts 
we here create you earl of shrewsbury 
and in our coronation take your place 
sennet  flourish  exeunt all but vernon and basset


vernon

now  sir  to you  that were so hot at sea 
disgracing of these colours that i wear
in honour of my noble lord of york 
darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest 


basset

yes  sir  as well as you dare patronage
the envious barking of your saucy tongue
against my lord the duke of somerset 


vernon

sirrah  thy lord i honour as he is 


basset

why  what is he  as good a man as york 


vernon

hark ye  not so  in witness  take ye that 
strikes him


basset

villain  thou know the law of arms is such
that whoso draws a sword   present death 
or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood 
but i unto his majesty  and crave
i may have liberty to venge this wrong 
when thou shalt see i meet thee to thy cost 


vernon

well  miscreant  i be there as soon as you 
and  after  meet you sooner than you would 
exeunt
