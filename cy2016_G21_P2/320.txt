scene i  a room in polonius  house 


enter polonius and reynaldo


lord polonius

give him this money and these notes  reynaldo 


reynaldo

i will  my lord 


lord polonius

you shall do marvellous wisely  good reynaldo 
before you visit him  to make inquire
of his behavior 


reynaldo

                  my lord  i did intend it 


lord polonius

marry  well said  very well said  look you  sir 
inquire me first what danskers are in paris 
and how  and who  what means  and where they keep 
what company  at what expense  and finding
by this encompassment and drift of question
that they do know my son  come you more nearer
than your particular demands will touch it 
take you  as  twere  some distant knowledge of him 
as thus   know his father and his friends 
and in part him    do you mark this  reynaldo 


reynaldo

ay  very well  my lord 


lord polonius

 in part him  but  you may say  well 
but  if be he i mean  he very wild 
addicted so and so  and there put on him
what forgeries you please  marry  none so rank
as may dishonour him  take heed of that 
but  sir  such wanton  wild and usual slips
as are companions noted and most known
to youth and liberty 


reynaldo

as gaming  my lord 


lord polonius

ay  or drinking  fencing  swearing  quarrelling 
drabbing  you may go so far 


reynaldo

my lord  that would dishonour him 


lord polonius

 faith  no  as you may season it in the charge
you must not put another scandal on him 
that he is open to incontinency 
that not my meaning  but breathe his faults so quaintly
that they may seem the taints of liberty 
the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind 
a savageness in unreclaimed blood 
of general assault 


reynaldo

but  my good lord 


lord polonius

wherefore should you do this 


reynaldo

ay  my lord 
i would know that 


lord polonius

                  marry  sir  here my drift 
and i believe  it is a fetch of wit 
you laying these slight sullies on my son 
as  a thing a little soil i  the working  mark you 
your party in converse  him you would sound 
having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
the youth you breathe of guilty  be assured
he closes with you in this consequence 
 sir  or so  or  friend  or  gentleman 
according to the phrase or the addition
of man and country 


reynaldo

very good  my lord 


lord polonius

and then  sir  does he this he does what was i
about to say  by the mass  i was about to say
something  where did i leave 


reynaldo

at  in the consequence  at  or so 
and  gentleman 


lord polonius

at  in the consequence  ay  marry 
he closes thus   know the gentleman 
i saw him yesterday  or t  other day 
or then  or then  with such  or such  and  as you say 
there was a  gaming  there o in rouse 
there falling out at tennis  or perchance 
 saw him enter such a house of sale 
videlicet  a brothel  or so forth 
see you now 
your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth 
and thus do we of wisdom and of reach 
with windlasses and with assays of bias 
by indirections find directions out 
so by my former lecture and advice 
shall you my son  you have me  have you not 


reynaldo

my lord  i have 


lord polonius

                  god be wi  you  fare you well 


reynaldo

good my lord 


lord polonius

observe his inclination in yourself 


reynaldo

i shall  my lord 


lord polonius

and let him ply his music 


reynaldo

well  my lord 


lord polonius

farewell 
exit reynaldo
enter ophelia
how now  ophelia  what the matter 


ophelia

o  my lord  my lord  i have been so affrighted 


lord polonius

with what  i  the name of god 


ophelia

my lord  as i was sewing in my closet 
lord hamlet  with his doublet all unbraced 
no hat upon his head  his stockings foul d 
ungarter d  and down gyved to his ancle 
pale as his shirt  his knees knocking each other 
and with a look so piteous in purport
as if he had been loosed out of hell
to speak of horrors he comes before me 


lord polonius

mad for thy love 


ophelia

                  my lord  i do not know 
but truly  i do fear it 


lord polonius

what said he 


ophelia

he took me by the wrist and held me hard 
then goes he to the length of all his arm 
and  with his other hand thus o his brow 
he falls to such perusal of my face
as he would draw it  long stay he so 
at last  a little shaking of mine arm
and thrice his head thus waving up and down 
he raised a sigh so piteous and profound
as it did seem to shatter all his bulk
and end his being  that done  he lets me go 
and  with his head over his shoulder turn d 
he seem to find his way without his eyes 
for out o  doors he went without their helps 
and  to the last  bended their light on me 


lord polonius

come  go with me  i will go seek the king 
this is the very ecstasy of love 
whose violent property fordoes itself
and leads the will to desperate undertakings
as oft as any passion under heaven
that does afflict our natures  i am sorry 
what  have you given him any hard words of late 


ophelia

no  my good lord  but  as you did command 
i did repel his fetters and denied
his access to me 


lord polonius

                  that hath made him mad 
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment
i had not quoted him  i fear he did but trifle 
and meant to wreck thee  but  beshrew my jealousy 
by heaven  it is as proper to our age
to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
as it is common for the younger sort
to lack discretion  come  go we to the king 
this must be known  which  being kept close  might
move
more grief to hide than hate to utter love
