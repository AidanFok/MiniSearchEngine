enter king claudius  queen gertrude  rosencrantz  guildenstern  and attendants


king claudius

welcome  dear rosencrantz and guildenstern 
moreover that we much did long to see you 
the need we have to use you did provoke
our hasty sending  something have you heard
of hamlet transformation  so call it 
sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
resembles that it was  what it should be 
more than his father death  that thus hath put him
so much from the understanding of himself 
i cannot dream of  i entreat you both 
that  being of so young days brought up with him 
and sith so neighbour to his youth and havior 
that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
some little time  so by your companies
to draw him on to pleasures  and to gather 
so much as from occasion you may glean 
whether aught  to us unknown  afflicts him thus 
that  open d  lies within our remedy 


queen gertrude

good gentlemen  he hath much talk of you 
and sure i am two men there are not living
to whom he more adheres  if it will please you
to show us so much gentry and good will
as to expend your time with us awhile 
for the supply and profit of our hope 
your visitation shall receive such thanks
as fits a king remembrance 


rosencrantz

both your majesties
might  by the sovereign power you have of us 
put your dread pleasures more into command
than to entreaty 


guildenstern

                  but we both obey 
and here give up ourselves  in the full bent
to lay our service freely at your feet 
to be commanded 


king claudius

thanks  rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern 


queen gertrude

thanks  guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz 
and i beseech you instantly to visit
my too much changed son  go  some of you 
and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is 


guildenstern

heavens make our presence and our practises
pleasant and helpful to him 


queen gertrude

ay  amen 
exeunt rosencrantz  guildenstern  and some attendants
enter polonius


lord polonius

the ambassadors from norway  my good lord 
are joyfully return d 


king claudius

thou still hast been the father of good news 


lord polonius

have i  my lord  i assure my good liege 
i hold my duty  as i hold my soul 
both to my god and to my gracious king 
and i do think  or else this brain of mine
hunts not the trail of policy so sure
as it hath used to do  that i have found
the very cause of hamlet lunacy 


king claudius

o  speak of that  that do i long to hear 


lord polonius

give first admittance to the ambassadors 
my news shall be the fruit to that great feast 


king claudius

thyself do grace to them  and bring them in 
exit polonius
he tells me  my dear gertrude  he hath found
the head and source of all your son distemper 


queen gertrude

i doubt it is no other but the main 
his father death  and our o marriage 


king claudius

well  we shall sift him 
re enter polonius  with voltimand and cornelius
welcome  my good friends 
say  voltimand  what from our brother norway 


voltimand

most fair return of greetings and desires 
upon our first  he sent out to suppress
his nephew levies  which to him appear 
to be a preparation  the polack 
but  better look into  he truly found
it was against your highness  whereat grieved 
that so his sickness  age and impotence
was falsely borne in hand  sends out arrests
on fortinbras  which he  in brief  obeys 
receives rebuke from norway  and in fine
makes vow before his uncle never more
to give the assay of arms against your majesty 
whereon old norway  overcome with joy 
gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee 
and his commission to employ those soldiers 
so levied as before  against the polack 
with an entreaty  herein further shown 
giving a paper
that it might please you to give quiet pass
through your dominions for this enterprise 
on such regards of safety and allowance
as therein are set down 


king claudius

it likes us well 
and at our more consider time well read 
answer  and think upon this business 
meantime we thank you for your well took labour 
go to your rest  at night we feast together 
most welcome home 
exeunt voltimand and cornelius


lord polonius

                  this business is well ended 
my liege  and madam  to expostulate
what majesty should be  what duty is 
why day is day  night night  and time is time 
were nothing but to waste night  day and time 
therefore  since brevity is the soul of wit 
and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes 
i will be brief  your noble son is mad 
mad call i it  for  to define true madness 
what is but to be nothing else but mad 
but let that go 


queen gertrude

                  more matter  with less art 


lord polonius

madam  i swear i use no art at all 
that he is mad   true   true  pity 
and pity  true  a foolish figure 
but farewell it  for i will use no art 
mad let us grant him  then  and now remains
that we find out the cause of this effect 
or rather say  the cause of this defect 
for this effect defective comes by cause 
thus it remains  and the remainder thus  perpend 
i have a daughter have while she is mine 
who  in her duty and obedience  mark 
hath given me this  now gather  and surmise 
reads
 the celestial and my soul idol  the most
beautified ophelia 
that an ill phrase  a vile phrase   beautified  is
a vile phrase  but you shall hear  thus 
reads
 her excellent white bosom  these     c 


queen gertrude

came this from hamlet to her 


lord polonius

good madam  stay awhile  i will be faithful 
reads
 thou the stars are fire 
doubt that the sun doth move 
doubt truth to be a liar 
but never doubt i love 
 dear ophelia  i am ill at these numbers 
i have not art to reckon my groans  but that
i love thee best  o most best  believe it  adieu 
 evermore most dear lady  whilst
this machine is to him  hamlet 
this  in obedience  hath my daughter shown me 
and more above  hath his solicitings 
as they fell out by time  by means and place 
all given to mine ear 


king claudius

but how hath she
received his love 


lord polonius

                  what do you think of me 


king claudius

as of a man faithful and honourable 


lord polonius

i would fain prove so  but what might you think 
when i had seen this hot love on the wing 
as i perceived it  i must tell you that 
before my daughter told me what might you 
or my dear majesty your queen here  think 
if i had play the desk or table book 
or given my heart a winking  mute and dumb 
or look upon this love with idle sight 
what might you think  no  i went round to work 
and my young mistress thus i did bespeak 
 hamlet is a prince  out of thy star 
this must not be  and then i precepts gave her 
that she should lock herself from his resort 
admit no messengers  receive no tokens 
which done  she took the fruits of my advice 
and he  repulsed a short tale to make 
fell into a sadness  then into a fast 
thence to a watch  thence into a weakness 
thence to a lightness  and  by this declension 
into the madness wherein now he raves 
and all we mourn for 


king claudius

do you think  this 


queen gertrude

it may be  very likely 


lord polonius

hath there been such a time i fain know that 
that i have positively said  so 
when it proved otherwise 


king claudius

not that i know 


lord polonius

 pointing to his head and shoulder 
take this from this  if this be otherwise 
if circumstances lead me  i will find
where truth is hid  though it were hid indeed
within the centre 


king claudius

                  how may we try it further 


lord polonius

you know  sometimes he walks four hours together
here in the lobby 


queen gertrude

                  so he does indeed 


lord polonius

at such a time i loose my daughter to him 
be you and i behind an arras then 
mark the encounter  if he love her not
and be not from his reason fall thereon 
let me be no assistant for a state 
but keep a farm and carters 


king claudius

we will try it 


queen gertrude

but  look  where sadly the poor wretch comes reading 


lord polonius

away  i do beseech you  both away 
i board him presently 
exeunt king claudius  queen gertrude  and attendants
enter hamlet  reading
o  give me leave 
how does my good lord hamlet 


hamlet

well  god a mercy 


lord polonius

do you know me  my lord 


hamlet

excellent well  you are a fishmonger 


lord polonius

not i  my lord 


hamlet

then i would you were so honest a man 


lord polonius

honest  my lord 


hamlet

ay  sir  to be honest  as this world goes  is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand 


lord polonius

that very true  my lord 


hamlet

for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog  being a
god kissing carrion have you a daughter 


lord polonius

i have  my lord 


hamlet

let her not walk i  the sun  conception is a
blessing  but not as your daughter may conceive 
friend  look to  t 


lord polonius

 aside   how say you by that  still harping on my
daughter  yet he knew me not at first  he said i
was a fishmonger  he is far gone  far gone  and
truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for
love  very near this  i speak to him again 
what do you read  my lord 


hamlet

words  words  words 


lord polonius

what is the matter  my lord 


hamlet

between who 


lord polonius

i mean  the matter that you read  my lord 


hamlet

slanders  sir  for the satirical rogue says here
that old men have grey beards  that their faces are
wrinkled  their eyes purging thick amber and
plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit  together with most weak hams  all which  sir 
though i most powerfully and potently believe  yet
i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down  for
yourself  sir  should be old as i am  if like a crab
you could go backward 


lord polonius

 aside   though this be madness  yet there is method
in  t  will you walk out of the air  my lord 


hamlet

into my grave 


lord polonius

indeed  that is out o  the air 
aside
how pregnant sometimes his replies are  a happiness
that often madness hits on  which reason and sanity
could not so prosperously be delivered of  i will
leave him  and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my daughter my honourable
lord  i will most humbly take my leave of you 


hamlet

you cannot  sir  take from me any thing that i will
more willingly part withal  except my life  except
my life  except my life 


lord polonius

fare you well  my lord 


hamlet

these tedious old fools 
enter rosencrantz and guildenstern


lord polonius

you go to seek the lord hamlet  there he is 


rosencrantz

 to polonius   god save you  sir 
exit polonius


guildenstern

my honoured lord 


rosencrantz

my most dear lord 


hamlet

my excellent good friends  how dost thou 
guildenstern  ah  rosencrantz  good lads  how do ye both 


rosencrantz

as the indifferent children of the earth 


guildenstern

happy  in that we are not over happy 
on fortune cap we are not the very button 


hamlet

nor the soles of her shoe 


rosencrantz

neither  my lord 


hamlet

then you live about her waist  or in the middle of
her favours 


guildenstern

 faith  her privates we 


hamlet

in the secret parts of fortune  o  most true  she
is a strumpet  what the news 


rosencrantz

none  my lord  but that the world grown honest 


hamlet

then is doomsday near  but your news is not true 
let me question more in particular  what have you 
my good friends  deserved at the hands of fortune 
that she sends you to prison hither 


guildenstern

prison  my lord 


hamlet

denmark a prison 


rosencrantz

then is the world one 


hamlet

a goodly one  in which there are many confines 
wards and dungeons  denmark being one o  the worst 


rosencrantz

we think not so  my lord 


hamlet

why  then   none to you  for there is nothing
either good or bad  but thinking makes it so  to me
it is a prison 


rosencrantz

why then  your ambition makes it one   too
narrow for your mind 


hamlet

o god  i could be bounded in a nut shell and count
myself a king of infinite space  were it not that i
have bad dreams 


guildenstern

which dreams indeed are ambition  for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream 


hamlet

a dream itself is but a shadow 


rosencrantz

truly  and i hold ambition of so airy and light a
quality that it is but a shadow shadow 


hamlet

then are our beggars bodies  and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes the beggars  shadows  shall we
to the court  for  by my fay  i cannot reason 


rosencrantz

guildenstern

we wait upon you 


hamlet

no such matter  i will not sort you with the rest
of my servants  for  to speak to you like an honest
man  i am most dreadfully attended  but  in the
beaten way of friendship  what make you at elsinore 


rosencrantz

to visit you  my lord  no other occasion 


hamlet

beggar that i am  i am even poor in thanks  but i
thank you  and sure  dear friends  my thanks are
too dear a halfpenny  were you not sent for  is it
your own inclining  is it a free visitation  come 
deal justly with me  come  come  nay  speak 


guildenstern

what should we say  my lord 


hamlet

why  any thing  but to the purpose  you were sent
for  and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour 
i know the good king and queen have sent for you 


rosencrantz

to what end  my lord 


hamlet

that you must teach me  but let me conjure you  by
the rights of our fellowship  by the consonancy of
our youth  by the obligation of our ever preserved
love  and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal  be even and direct with me 
whether you were sent for  or no 


rosencrantz

 aside to guildenstern   what say you 


hamlet

 aside   nay  then  i have an eye of you if you
love me  hold not off 


guildenstern

my lord  we were sent for 


hamlet

i will tell you why  so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery  and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather  i have of late but
wherefore i know not lost all my mirth  forgone all
custom of exercises  and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame  the
earth  seems to me a sterile promontory  this most
excellent canopy  the air  look you  this brave
o firmament  this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire  why  it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours 
what a piece of work is a man  how noble in reason 
how infinite in faculty  in form and moving how
express and admirable  in action how like an angel 
in apprehension how like a god  the beauty of the
world  the paragon of animals  and yet  to me 
what is this quintessence of dust  man delights not
me  no  nor woman neither  though by your smiling
you seem to say so 


rosencrantz

my lord  there was no such stuff in my thoughts 


hamlet

why did you laugh then  when i said  delights not me 


rosencrantz

to think  my lord  if you delight not in man  what
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
you  we coted them on the way  and hither are they
coming  to offer you service 


hamlet

he that plays the king shall be welcome  his majesty
shall have tribute of me  the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target  the lover shall not
sigh gratis  the humourous man shall end his part
in peace  the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o  the sere  and the lady shall
say her mind freely  or the blank verse shall halt
for t  what players are they 


rosencrantz

even those you were wont to take delight in  the
tragedians of the city 


hamlet

how chances it they travel  their residence  both
in reputation and profit  was better both ways 


rosencrantz

i think their inhibition comes by the means of the
late innovation 


hamlet

do they hold the same estimation they did when i was
in the city  are they so followed 


rosencrantz

no  indeed  are they not 


hamlet

how comes it  do they grow rusty 


rosencrantz

nay  their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace  but
there is  sir  an aery of children  little eyases 
that cry out on the top of question  and are most
tyrannically clapped for t  these are now the
fashion  and so berattle the common stages so they
call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose quills and dare scarce come thither 


hamlet

what  are they children  who maintains  em  how are
they escoted  will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing  will they not say
afterwards  if they should grow themselves to common
players as it is most like  if their means are no
better their writers do them wrong  to make them
exclaim against their own succession 


rosencrantz

 faith  there has been much to do on both sides  and
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
controversy  there was  for a while  no money bid
for argument  unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question 


hamlet

is possible 


guildenstern

o  there has been much throwing about of brains 


hamlet

do the boys carry it away 


rosencrantz

ay  that they do  my lord  hercules and his load too 


hamlet

it is not very strange  for mine uncle is king of
denmark  and those that would make mows at him while
my father lived  give twenty  forty  fifty  an
hundred ducats a piece for his picture in little 
 sblood  there is something in this more than
natural  if philosophy could find it out 
flourish of trumpets within


guildenstern

there are the players 


hamlet

gentlemen  you are welcome to elsinore  your hands 
come then  the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony  let me comply with you in this garb 
lest my extent to the players  which  i tell you 
must show fairly outward  should more appear like
entertainment than yours  you are welcome  but my
uncle father and aunt mother are deceived 


guildenstern

in what  my dear lord 


hamlet

i am but mad north north west  when the wind is
southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw 
enter polonius


lord polonius

well be with you  gentlemen 


hamlet

hark you  guildenstern  and you too  at each ear a
hearer  that great baby you see there is not yet
out of his swaddling clouts 


rosencrantz

happily he the second time come to them  for they
say an old man is twice a child 


hamlet

i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players 
mark it  you say right  sir  o  monday morning 
 so indeed 


lord polonius

my lord  i have news to tell you 


hamlet

my lord  i have news to tell you 
when roscius was an actor in rome 


lord polonius

the actors are come hither  my lord 


hamlet

buz  buz 


lord polonius

upon mine honour 


hamlet

then came each actor on his ass 


lord polonius

the best actors in the world  either for tragedy 
comedy  history  pastoral  pastoral comical 
historical pastoral  tragical historical  tragical 
comical historical pastoral  scene individable  or
poem unlimited  seneca cannot be too heavy  nor
plautus too light  for the law of writ and the
liberty  these are the only men 


hamlet

o jephthah  judge of israel  what a treasure hadst thou 


lord polonius

what a treasure had he  my lord 


hamlet

why 
 fair daughter and no more 
the which he loved passing well 


lord polonius

 aside   still on my daughter 


hamlet

am i not i  the right  old jephthah 


lord polonius

if you call me jephthah  my lord  i have a daughter
that i love passing well 


hamlet

nay  that follows not 


lord polonius

what follows  then  my lord 


hamlet

why 
 by lot  god wot 
and then  you know 
 came to pass  as most like it was 
the first row of the pious chanson will show you
more  for look  where my abridgement comes 
enter four or five players
you are welcome  masters  welcome  all  i am glad
to see thee well  welcome  good friends  o  my old
friend  thy face is valenced since i saw thee last 
comest thou to beard me in denmark  what  my young
lady and mistress  by lady  your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when i saw you last  by the
altitude of a chopine  pray god  your voice  like
apiece of uncurrent gold  be not cracked within the
ring  masters  you are all welcome  we e 
to like french falconers  fly at any thing we see 
we have a speech straight  come  give us a taste
of your quality  come  a passionate speech 


first player

what speech  my lord 


hamlet

i heard thee speak me a speech once  but it was
never acted  or  if it was  not above once  for the
play  i remember  pleased not the million   
caviare to the general  but it was as i received
it  and others  whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of mine an excellent play  well
digested in the scenes  set down with as much
modesty as cunning  i remember  one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury  nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation  but called it an
honest method  as wholesome as sweet  and by very
much more handsome than fine  one speech in it i
chiefly loved   aeneas  tale to dido  and
thereabout of it especially  where he speaks of
priam slaughter  if it live in your memory  begin
at this line  let me see  let me see 
 rugged pyrrhus  like the hyrcanian beast 
it is not so it begins with pyrrhus 
 rugged pyrrhus  he whose sable arms 
black as his purpose  did the night resemble
when he lay couched in the ominous horse 
hath now this dread and black complexion smear 
with heraldry more dismal  head to foot
now is he total gules  horridly trick 
with blood of fathers  mothers  daughters  sons 
baked and impasted with the parching streets 
that lend a tyrannous and damned light
to their lord murder  roasted in wrath and fire 
and thus o er sized with coagulate gore 
with eyes like carbuncles  the hellish pyrrhus
old grandsire priam seeks 
so  proceed you 


lord polonius

 god  my lord  well spoken  with good accent and
good discretion 


first player

 he finds him
striking too short at greeks  his antique sword 
rebellious to his arm  lies where it falls 
repugnant to command  unequal match d 
pyrrhus at priam drives  in rage strikes wide 
but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
the unnerved father falls  then senseless ilium 
seeming to feel this blow  with flaming top
stoops to his base  and with a hideous crash
takes prisoner pyrrhus  ear  for  lo  his sword 
which was declining on the milky head
of reverend priam  seem i  the air to stick 
so  as a painted tyrant  pyrrhus stood 
and like a neutral to his will and matter 
did nothing 
but  as we often see  against some storm 
a silence in the heavens  the rack stand still 
the bold winds speechless and the orb below
as hush as death  anon the dreadful thunder
doth rend the region  so  after pyrrhus  pause 
aroused vengeance sets him new a work 
and never did the cyclops  hammers fall
on mars armour forged for proof eterne
with less remorse than pyrrhus  bleeding sword
now falls on priam 
out  out  thou strumpet  fortune  all you gods 
in general synod  away her power 
break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel 
and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven 
as low as to the fiends 


lord polonius

first player

 barefoot up and down  threatening the flames
with bisson rheum  a clout upon that head
where late the diadem stood  and for a robe 
about her lank and all o er teemed loins 
a blanket  in the alarm of fear caught up 
who this had seen  with tongue in venom steep d 
 fortune state would treason have
pronounced 
but if the gods themselves did see her then
when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport
in mincing with his sword her husband limbs 
the instant burst of clamour that she made 
unless things mortal move them not at all 
would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven 
and passion in the gods

now i am alone 
o  what a rogue and peasant slave am i 
is it not monstrous that this player here 
but in a fiction  in a dream of passion 
could force his soul so to his own conceit
that from her working all his visage wann d 
tears in his eyes  distraction in aspect 
a broken voice  and his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit  and all for nothing 
for hecuba 
what hecuba to him  or he to hecuba 
that he should weep for her  what would he do 
had he the motive and the cue for passion
that i have  he would drown the stage with tears
and cleave the general ear with horrid speech 
make mad the guilty and appal the free 
confound the ignorant  and amaze indeed
the very faculties of eyes and ears  yet i 
a dull and muddy mettled rascal  peak 
like john a dreams  unpregnant of my cause 
and can say nothing  no  not for a king 
upon whose property and most dear life
a damn defeat was made  am i a coward 
who calls me villain  breaks my pate across 
plucks off my beard  and blows it in my face 
tweaks me by the nose  gives me the lie i  the throat 
as deep as to the lungs  who does me this 
ha 
 swounds  i should take it  for it cannot be
but i am pigeon liver and lack gall
to make oppression bitter  or ere this
i should have fatted all the region kites
with this slave offal  bloody  bawdy villain 
remorseless  treacherous  lecherous  kindless villain 
o  vengeance 
why  what an ass am i  this is most brave 
that i  the son of a dear father murder d 
prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell 
must  like a whore  unpack my heart with words 
and fall a cursing  like a very drab 
a scullion 
fie upon t  foh  about  my brain  i have heard
that guilty creatures sitting at a play
have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul that presently
they have proclaim their malefactions 
for murder  though it have no tongue  will speak
with most miraculous organ  i have these players
play something like the murder of my father
before mine uncle  i observe his looks 
i tent him to the quick  if he but blench 
i know my course  the spirit that i have seen
may be the devil  and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape  yea  and perhaps
out of my weakness and my melancholy 
as he is very potent with such spirits 
abuses me to damn me  i have grounds
more relative than this  the play  the thing
wherein i catch the conscience of the king
