hamlet

speak the speech  i pray you  as i pronounced it to
you  trippingly on the tongue  but if you mouth it 
as many of your players do  i had as lief the
town crier spoke my lines  nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand  thus  but use all gently 
for in the very torrent  tempest  and  as i may say 
the whirlwind of passion  you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness  o  it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters  to
very rags  to split the ears of the groundlings  who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise  i would have such
a fellow whipped for o termagant  it
out herods herod  pray you  avoid it

i warrant your honour 


hamlet

be not too tame neither  but let your own discretion
be your tutor  suit the action to the word  the
word to the action  with this special o not
the modesty of nature  for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing  whose end  both at the
first and now  was and is  to hold  as  twere  the
mirror up to nature  to show virtue her own feature 
scorn her own image  and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure  now this overdone 
or come tardy off  though it make the unskilful
laugh  cannot but make the judicious grieve  the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o a whole theatre of others  o  there be
players that i have seen play  and heard others
praise  and that highly  not to speak it profanely 
that  neither having the accent of christians nor
the gait of christian  pagan  nor man  have so
strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of
nature journeymen had made men and not made them
well  they imitated humanity so abominably 


first player

i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us 
sir 


hamlet

o  reform it altogether  and let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them 
for there be of them that will themselves laugh  to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too  though  in the mean time  some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered 
that villanous  and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it  go  make you ready

and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
where thrift may follow fawning  dost thou hear 
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
and could of men distinguish  her election
hath seal thee for herself  for thou hast been
as one  in suffering all  that suffers nothing 
a man that fortune buffets and rewards
hast ta with equal thanks  and blest are those
whose blood and judgment are so well commingled 
that they are not a pipe for fortune finger
to sound what stop she please  give me that man
that is not passion slave  and i will wear him
in my heart core  ay  in my heart of heart 
as i do thee something too much of this 
there is a play to night before the king 
one scene of it comes near the circumstance
which i have told thee of my father death 
i prithee  when thou seest that act afoot 
even with the very comment of thy soul
observe mine uncle  if his occulted guilt
do not itself unkennel in one speech 
it is a damned ghost that we have seen 
and my imaginations are as foul
as vulcan stithy  give him heedful note 
for i mine eyes will rivet to his face 
and after we will both our judgments join
in censure of his seeming

 brief  my lord 


hamlet

as woman love 
enter two players  king and queen


player king

   full thirty times hath phoebus  cart gone round
neptune salt wash and tellus  orbed ground 
and thirty dozen moons with borrow sheen
about the world have times twelve thirties been 
since love our hearts and hymen did our hands
unite commutual in most sacred bands 


player queen

   so many journeys may the sun and moon
make us again count o ere love be done 
but  woe is me  you are so sick of late 
so far from cheer and from your former state 
that i distrust you  yet  though i distrust 
discomfort you  my lord  it nothing must 
for women fear and love holds quantity 
in neither aught  or in extremity 
now  what my love is  proof hath made you know 
and as my love is sized  my fear is so 
where love is great  the littlest doubts are fear 
where little fears grow great  great love grows there 


player king

 faith  i must leave thee  love  and shortly too 
my operant powers their functions leave to do 
and thou shalt live in this fair world behind 
honour d  beloved  and haply one as kind
for husband shalt thou 


player queen

o  confound the rest 
such love must needs be treason in my breast 
in second husband let me be accurst 
none wed the second but who kill the first 


hamlet

 aside   wormwood  wormwood 


player queen

   the instances that second marriage move
are base respects of thrift  but none of love 
a second time i kill my husband dead 
when second husband kisses me in bed 


player king

   i do believe you think what now you speak 
but what we do determine oft we break 
purpose is but the slave to memory 
of violent birth  but poor validity 
which now  like fruit unripe  sticks on the tree 
but fall  unshaken  when they mellow be 
most necessary  that we forget
to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt 
what to ourselves in passion we propose 
the passion ending  doth the purpose lose 
the violence of either grief or joy
their own enactures with themselves destroy 
where joy most revels  grief doth most lament 
grief joys  joy grieves  on slender accident 
this world is not for aye  nor  not strange
that even our loves should with our fortunes change 
for  a question left us yet to prove 
whether love lead fortune  or else fortune love 
the great man down  you mark his favourite flies 
the poor advanced makes friends of enemies 
and hitherto doth love on fortune tend 
for who not needs shall never lack a friend 
and who in want a hollow friend doth try 
directly seasons him his enemy 
but  orderly to end where i begun 
our wills and fates do so contrary run
that our devices still are overthrown 
our thoughts are ours  their ends none of our own 
so think thou wilt no second husband wed 
but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead 


player queen

   nor earth to me give food  nor heaven light 
sport and repose lock from me day and night 
to desperation turn my trust and hope 
an anchor cheer in prison be my scope 
each opposite that blanks the face of joy
meet what i would have well and it destroy 
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife 
if  once a widow  ever i be wife 


hamlet

if she should break it now 


player king

 deeply sworn  sweet  leave me here awhile 
my spirits grow dull  and fain i would beguile
the tedious day with sleep 
sleeps


player queen

sleep rock thy brain 
and never come mischance between us twain

hamlet

with drink  sir 


guildenstern

no  my lord  rather with choler 


hamlet

your wisdom should show itself more richer to
signify this to his doctor  for  for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler 


guildenstern

good my lord  put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair

or  rather  as you say  my mother  therefore no
more  but to the matter  my mother  you say 


rosencrantz

then thus she says  your behavior hath struck her
into amazement and admiration 


hamlet

o wonderful son  that can so astonish a mother  but
is there no sequel at the heels of this mother 
admiration  impart 


rosencrantz

she desires to speak with you in her closet  ere you
go to bed

do  surely  bar the door upon your own liberty  if
you deny your griefs to your friend 


hamlet

sir  i lack advancement

himself for your succession in denmark

your fingers and thumb  give it breath with your
mouth  and it will discourse most eloquent music 
look you  these are the stops 


guildenstern

but these cannot i command to any utterance of
harmony  i have not the skill 


hamlet

why  look you now  how unworthy a thing you make of
me  you would play upon me  you would seem to know
my stops  you would pluck out the heart of my
mystery  you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass  and there is much music 
excellent voice  in this little organ  yet cannot
you make it speak   sblood  do you think i am
easier to be played on than a pipe  call me what
instrument you will  though you can fret me  yet you
cannot play upon me

would quake to look on  soft  now to my mother 
o heart  lose not thy nature  let not ever
the soul of nero enter this firm bosom 
let me be cruel  not unnatural 
i will speak daggers to her  but use none 
my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites 
how in my words soever she be shent 
to give them seals never  my soul  consent
