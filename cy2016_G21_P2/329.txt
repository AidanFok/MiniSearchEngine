enter king claudius  rosencrantz  and guildenstern


king claudius

i like him not  nor stands it safe with us
to let his madness range  therefore prepare you 
i your commission will forthwith dispatch 
and he to england shall along with you 
the terms of our estate may not endure
hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
out of his lunacies 


guildenstern

we will ourselves provide 
most holy and religious fear it is
to keep those many many bodies safe
that live and feed upon your majesty 


rosencrantz

the single and peculiar life is bound 
with all the strength and armour of the mind 
to keep itself from noyance  but much more
that spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
the lives of many  the cease of majesty
dies not alone  but  like a gulf  doth draw
what near it with it  it is a massy wheel 
fix on the summit of the highest mount 
to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
are mortised and adjoin d  which  when it falls 
each small annexment  petty consequence 
attends the boisterous ruin  never alone
did the king sigh  but with a general groan 


king claudius

arm you  i pray you  to this speedy voyage 
for we will fetters put upon this fear 
which now goes too free footed

we will haste us

enter polonius


lord polonius

my lord  he going to his mother closet 
behind the arras i convey myself 
to hear the process  and warrant she tax him home 
and  as you said  and wisely was it said 
 meet that some more audience than a mother 
since nature makes them partial  should o 
the speech  of vantage  fare you well  my liege 
i call upon you ere you go to bed 
and tell you what i know 


king claudius

thanks  dear my lord 
exit polonius
o  my offence is rank it smells to heaven 
it hath the primal eldest curse upon t 
a brother murder  pray can i not 
though inclination be as sharp as will 
my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent 
and  like a man to double business bound 
i stand in pause where i shall first begin 
and both neglect  what if this cursed hand
were thicker than itself with brother blood 
is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
to wash it white as snow  whereto serves mercy
but to confront the visage of offence 
and what in prayer but this two fold force 
to be forestalled ere we come to fall 
or pardon being down  then i look up 
my fault is past  but  o  what form of prayer
can serve my turn   me my foul murder 
that cannot be  since i am still possess 
of those effects for which i did the murder 
my crown  mine own ambition and my queen 
may one be pardon and retain the offence 
in the corrupted currents of this world
offence gilded hand may shove by justice 
and oft  seen the wicked prize itself
buys out the law  but  not so above 
there is no shuffling  there the action lies
in his true nature  and we ourselves compell d 
even to the teeth and forehead of our faults 
to give in evidence  what then  what rests 
try what repentance can  what can it not 
yet what can it when one can not repent 
o wretched state  o bosom black as death 
o limed soul  that  struggling to be free 
art more engaged  help  angels  make assay 
bow  stubborn knees  and  heart with strings of steel 
be soft as sinews of the newborn babe 
all may be well 
retires and kneels

now might i do it pat  now he is praying 
and now i do t  and so he goes to heaven 
and so am i revenged  that would be scann d 
a villain kills my father  and for that 
i  his sole son  do this same villain send
to heaven 
o  this is hire and salary  not revenge 
he took my father grossly  full of bread 
with all his crimes broad blown  as flush as may 
and how his audit stands who knows save heaven 
but in our circumstance and course of thought 
 heavy with him  and am i then revenged 
to take him in the purging of his soul 
when he is fit and season for his passage 
no 
up  sword  and know thou a more horrid hent 
when he is drunk asleep  or in his rage 
or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed 
at gaming  swearing  or about some act
that has no relish of salvation in t 
then trip him  that his heels may kick at heaven 
and that his soul may be as damn and black
as hell  whereto it goes  my mother stays 
this physic but prolongs thy sickly days 
exit


king claudius

 rising   my words fly up  my thoughts remain below 
words without thoughts never to heaven go
