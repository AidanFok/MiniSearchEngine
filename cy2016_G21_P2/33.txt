lord bishop  set the crown upon his head 
bishop


of winchester

god save king henry  of that name the sixth 


gloucester

now  governor of paris  take your oath 
that you elect no other king but him 
esteem none friends but such as are his friends 
and none your foes but such as shall pretend
malicious practises against his state 
this shall ye do  so help you righteous god

my gracious sovereign  as i rode from calais 
to haste unto your coronation 
a letter was deliver to my hands 
writ to your grace from the duke of burgundy 


talbot

shame to the duke of burgundy and thee 
i vow d  base knight  when i did meet thee next 
to tear the garter from thy craven leg 
plucking it off
which i have done  because unworthily
thou wast installed in that high degree 
pardon me  princely henry  and the rest
this dastard  at the battle of patay 
when but in all i was six thousand strong
and that the french were almost ten to one 
before we met or that a stroke was given 
like to a trusty squire did run away 
in which assault we lost twelve hundred men 
myself and divers gentlemen beside
were there surprised and taken prisoners 
then judge  great lords  if i have done amiss 
or whether that such cowards ought to wear
this ornament of knighthood  yea or no 


gloucester

to say the truth  this fact was infamous
and ill beseeming any common man 
much more a knight  a captain and a leader 


talbot

when first this order was ordain d  my lords 
knights of the garter were of noble birth 
valiant and virtuous  full of haughty courage 
such as were grown to credit by the wars 
not fearing death  nor shrinking for distress 
but always resolute in most extremes 
he then that is not furnish in this sort
doth but usurp the sacred name of knight 
profaning this most honourable order 
and should  if i were worthy to be judge 
be quite degraded  like a hedge born swain
that doth presume to boast of gentle blood 


king henry vi

stain to thy countrymen  thou hear thy doom 
be packing  therefore  thou that wast a knight 
henceforth we banish thee  on pain of death 
exit fastolfe
and now  my lord protector  view the letter
sent from our uncle duke of burgundy 


gloucester

what means his grace  that he hath changed his style 
no more but  plain and bluntly   the king 
hath he forgot he is his sovereign 
or doth this churlish superscription
pretend some alteration in good will 
what here 
reads
 have  upon especial cause 
moved with compassion of my country wreck 
together with the pitiful complaints
of such as your oppression feeds upon 
forsaken your pernicious faction
and join with charles  the rightful king of france 
o monstrous treachery  can this be so 
that in alliance  amity and oaths 
there should be found such false dissembling guile 


king henry vi

what  doth my uncle burgundy revolt 


gloucester

he doth  my lord  and is become your foe 


king henry vi

is that the worst this letter doth contain 


gloucester

it is the worst  and all  my lord  he writes 


king henry vi

why  then  lord talbot there shall talk with him
and give him chastisement for this abuse 
how say you  my lord  are you not content 


talbot

content  my liege  yes  but that i am prevented 
i should have begg i might have been employ d 


king henry vi

then gather strength and march unto him straight 
let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
and what offence it is to flout his friends 


talbot

i go  my lord  in heart desiring still
you may behold confusion of your foes 
exit
enter vernon and basset


vernon

grant me the combat  gracious sovereign 


basset

and me  my lord  grant me the combat too 


york

this is my servant  hear him  noble prince 


somerset

and this is mine  sweet henry  favour him 


king henry vi

be patient  lords  and give them leave to speak 
say  gentlemen  what makes you thus exclaim 
and wherefore crave you combat  or with whom 


vernon

with him  my lord  for he hath done me wrong 


basset

and i with him  for he hath done me wrong 


king henry vi

what is that wrong whereof you both complain 
first let me know  and then i answer you 


basset

crossing the sea from england into france 
this fellow here  with envious carping tongue 
upbraided me about the rose i wear 
saying  the sanguine colour of the leaves
did represent my master blushing cheeks 
when stubbornly he did repugn the truth
about a certain question in the law
argued betwixt the duke of york and him 
with other vile and ignominious terms 
in confutation of which rude reproach
and in defence of my lord worthiness 
i crave the benefit of law of arms 


vernon

and that is my petition  noble lord 
for though he seem with forged quaint conceit
to set a gloss upon his bold intent 
yet know  my lord  i was provoked by him 
and he first took exceptions at this badge 
pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
bewray the faintness of my master heart 


york

will not this malice  somerset  be left 


somerset

your private grudge  my lord of york  will out 
though ne so cunningly you smother it 


king henry vi

good lord  what madness rules in brainsick men 
when for so slight and frivolous a cause
such factious emulations shall arise 
good cousins both  of york and somerset 
quiet yourselves  i pray  and be at peace 


york

let this dissension first be tried by fight 
and then your highness shall command a peace 


somerset

the quarrel toucheth none but us alone 
betwixt ourselves let us decide it then 


york

there is my pledge  accept it  somerset 


vernon

nay  let it rest where it began at first 


basset

confirm it so  mine honourable lord 


gloucester

confirm it so  confounded be your strife 
and perish ye  with your audacious prate 
presumptuous vassals  are you not ashamed
with this immodest clamorous outrage
to trouble and disturb the king and us 
and you  my lords  methinks you do not well
to bear with their perverse objections 
much less to take occasion from their mouths
to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves 
let me persuade you take a better course 


exeter

it grieves his highness  good my lords  be friends 


king henry vi

come hither  you that would be combatants 
henceforth i charge you  as you love our favour 
quite to forget this quarrel and the cause 
and you  my lords  remember where we are 
in france  amongst a fickle wavering nation 
if they perceive dissension in our looks
and that within ourselves we disagree 
how will their grudging stomachs be provoked
to wilful disobedience  and rebel 
beside  what infamy will there arise 
when foreign princes shall be certified
that for a toy  a thing of no regard 
king henry peers and chief nobility
destroy themselves  and lost the realm of france 
o  think upon the conquest of my father 
my tender years  and let us not forego
that for a trifle that was bought with blood
let me be umpire in this doubtful strife 
i see no reason  if i wear this rose 
putting on a red rose
that any one should therefore be suspicious
i more incline to somerset than york 
both are my kinsmen  and i love them both 
as well they may upbraid me with my crown 
because  forsooth  the king of scots is crown d 
but your discretions better can persuade
than i am able to instruct or teach 
and therefore  as we hither came in peace 
so let us still continue peace and love 
cousin of york  we institute your grace
to be our regent in these parts of france 
and  good my lord of somerset  unite
your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot 
and  like true subjects  sons of your progenitors 
go cheerfully together and digest 
your angry choler on your enemies 
ourself  my lord protector and the rest
after some respite will return to calais 
from thence to england  where i hope ere long
to be presented  by your victories 
with charles  alencon and that traitorous rout 
flourish  exeunt all but york  warwick  exeter and vernon


warwick

my lord of york  i promise you  the king
prettily  methought  did play the orator 


york

and so he did  but yet i like it not 
in that he wears the badge of somerset 


warwick

tush  that was but his fancy  blame him not 
i dare presume  sweet prince  he thought no harm 


york

an if i wist he did but let it rest 
other affairs must now be managed 
exeunt all but exeter


exeter

well didst thou  richard  to suppress thy voice 
for  had the passions of thy heart burst out 
i fear we should have seen decipher there
more rancorous spite  more furious raging broils 
than yet can be imagined or supposed 
but howsoe er  no simple man that sees
this jarring discord of nobility 
this shouldering of each other in the court 
this factious bandying of their favourites 
but that it doth presage some ill event 
 much when sceptres are in children hands 
but more when envy breeds unkind division 
there comes the rain  there begins confusion 
exit
