hamlet

come  come  and sit you down  you shall not budge

where you may see the inmost part of you 


queen gertrude

what wilt thou do  thou wilt not murder me 
help  help  ho 


lord polonius

 behind   what  ho  help  help  help 


hamlet

 drawing   how now  a rat  dead  for a ducat  dead 
makes a pass through the arras


lord polonius

 behind   o  i am slain 
falls and dies


queen gertrude

o me  what hast thou done 


hamlet

nay  i know not 
is it the king 


queen gertrude

o  what a rash and bloody deed is this 


hamlet

a bloody deed  almost as bad  good mother 
as kill a king  and marry with his brother 


queen gertrude

as kill a king 


hamlet

                  ay  lady   my word 
lifts up the array and discovers polonius
thou wretched  rash  intruding fool  farewell 
i took thee for thy better  take thy fortune 
thou find to be too busy is some danger 
leave wringing of your hands  peace  sit you down 
and let me wring your heart  for so i shall 
if it be made of penetrable stuff 
if damned custom have not brass it so
that it is proof and bulwark against sense 


queen gertrude

what have i done  that thou darest wag thy tongue
in noise so rude against me 


hamlet

such an act
that blurs the grace and blush of modesty 
calls virtue hypocrite  takes off the rose
from the fair forehead of an innocent love
and sets a blister there  makes marriage vows
as false as dicers  oaths  o  such a deed
as from the body of contraction plucks
the very soul  and sweet religion makes
a rhapsody of words  heaven face doth glow 
yea  this solidity and compound mass 
with tristful visage  as against the doom 
is thought sick at the act 


queen gertrude

ay me  what act 
that roars so loud  and thunders in the index 


hamlet

look here  upon this picture  and on this 
the counterfeit presentment of two brothers 
see  what a grace was seated on this brow 
hyperion curls  the front of jove himself 
an eye like mars  to threaten and command 
a station like the herald mercury
new lighted on a heaven kissing hill 
a combination and a form indeed 
where every god did seem to set his seal 
to give the world assurance of a man 
this was your husband  look you now  what follows 
here is your husband  like a mildew ear 
blasting his wholesome brother  have you eyes 
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed 
and batten on this moor  ha  have you eyes 
you cannot call it love  for at your age
the hey day in the blood is tame  it humble 
and waits upon the judgment  and what judgment
would step from this to this  sense  sure  you have 
else could you not have motion  but sure  that sense
is apoplex d  for madness would not err 
nor sense to ecstasy was ne so thrall 
but it reserved some quantity of choice 
to serve in such a difference  what devil was 
that thus hath cozen you at hoodman blind 
eyes without feeling  feeling without sight 
ears without hands or eyes  smelling sans all 
or but a sickly part of one true sense
could not so mope 
o shame  where is thy blush  rebellious hell 
if thou canst mutine in a matron bones 
to flaming youth let virtue be as wax 
and melt in her own fire  proclaim no shame
when the compulsive ardour gives the charge 
since frost itself as actively doth burn
and reason panders will 


queen gertrude

o hamlet  speak no more 
thou turn mine eyes into my very soul 
and there i see such black and grained spots
as will not leave their tinct 


hamlet

nay  but to live
in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed 
stew in corruption  honeying and making love
over the nasty sty 


queen gertrude

o  speak to me no more 
these words  like daggers  enter in mine ears 
no more  sweet hamlet 


hamlet

a murderer and a villain 
a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
of your precedent lord  a vice of kings 
a cutpurse of the empire and the rule 
that from a shelf the precious diadem stole 
and put it in his pocket 


queen gertrude

no more 


hamlet

a king of shreds and patches 
enter ghost
save me  and hover o me with your wings 
you heavenly guards  what would your gracious figure 


queen gertrude

alas  he mad 


hamlet

do you not come your tardy son to chide 
that  lapsed in time and passion  lets go by
the important acting of your dread command  o  say 


ghost

do not forget  this visitation
is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose 
but  look  amazement on thy mother sits 
o  step between her and her fighting soul 
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works 
speak to her  hamlet 


hamlet

how is it with you  lady 


queen gertrude

alas  how is with you 
that you do bend your eye on vacancy
and with the incorporal air do hold discourse 
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep 
and  as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm 
your bedded hair  like life in excrements 
starts up  and stands on end  o gentle son 
upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
sprinkle cool patience  whereon do you look 


hamlet

on him  on him  look you  how pale he glares 
his form and cause conjoin d  preaching to stones 
would make them capable  do not look upon me 
lest with this piteous action you convert
my stern effects  then what i have to do
will want true colour  tears perchance for blood 


queen gertrude

to whom do you speak this 


hamlet

do you see nothing there 


queen gertrude

nothing at all  yet all that is i see 


hamlet

nor did you nothing hear 


queen gertrude

no  nothing but ourselves 


hamlet

why  look you there  look  how it steals away 
my father  in his habit as he lived 
look  where he goes  even now  out at the portal 
exit ghost


queen gertrude

this the very coinage of your brain 
this bodiless creation ecstasy
is very cunning in 


hamlet

ecstasy 
my pulse  as yours  doth temperately keep time 
and makes as healthful music  it is not madness
that i have utter d  bring me to the test 
and i the matter will re word  which madness
would gambol from  mother  for love of grace 
lay not that mattering unction to your soul 
that not your trespass  but my madness speaks 
it will but skin and film the ulcerous place 
whilst rank corruption  mining all within 
infects unseen  confess yourself to heaven 
repent what past  avoid what is to come 
and do not spread the compost on the weeds 
to make them ranker  forgive me this my virtue 
for in the fatness of these pursy times
virtue itself of vice must pardon beg 
yea  curb and woo for leave to do him good 


queen gertrude

o hamlet  thou hast cleft my heart in twain 


hamlet

o  throw away the worser part of it 
and live the purer with the other half 
good night  but go not to mine uncle bed 
assume a virtue  if you have it not 
that monster  custom  who all sense doth eat 
of habits devil  is angel yet in this 
that to the use of actions fair and good
he likewise gives a frock or livery 
that aptly is put on  refrain to night 
and that shall lend a kind of easiness
to the next abstinence  the next more easy 
for use almost can change the stamp of nature 
and either             the devil  or throw him out
with wondrous potency  once more  good night 
and when you are desirous to be bless d 
i blessing beg of you  for this same lord 
pointing to polonius
i do repent  but heaven hath pleased it so 
to punish me with this and this with me 
that i must be their scourge and minister 
i will bestow him  and will answer well
the death i gave him  so  again  good night 
i must be cruel  only to be kind 
thus bad begins and worse remains behind 
one word more  good lady 


queen gertrude

what shall i do 


hamlet

not this  by no means  that i bid you do 
let the bloat king tempt you again to bed 
pinch wanton on your cheek  call you his mouse 
and let him  for a pair of reechy kisses 
or paddling in your neck with his damn fingers 
make you to ravel all this matter out 
that i essentially am not in madness 
but mad in craft   good you let him know 
for who  that but a queen  fair  sober  wise 
would from a paddock  from a bat  a gib 
such dear concernings hide  who would do so 
no  in despite of sense and secrecy 
unpeg the basket on the house top 
let the birds fly  and  like the famous ape 
to try conclusions  in the basket creep 
and break your own neck down 


queen gertrude

be thou assured  if words be made of breath 
and breath of life  i have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me 


hamlet

i must to england  you know that 


queen gertrude

alack 
i had forgot   so concluded on 


hamlet

there letters seal d  and my two schoolfellows 
whom i will trust as i will adders fang d 
they bear the mandate  they must sweep my way 
and marshal me to knavery  let it work 
for  the sport to have the engineer
hoist with his own petard  and  shall go hard
but i will delve one yard below their mines 
and blow them at the moon  o   most sweet 
when in one line two crafts directly meet 
this man shall set me packing 
i lug the guts into the neighbour room 
mother  good night  indeed this counsellor
is now most still  most secret and most grave 
who was in life a foolish prating knave 
come  sir  to draw toward an end with you 
good night  mother 
exeunt severally  hamlet dragging in polonius
