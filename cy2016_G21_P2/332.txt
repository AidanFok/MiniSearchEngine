enter king claudius  queen gertrude  rosencrantz  and guildenstern


king claudius

there matter in these sighs  these profound heaves 
you must translate   fit we understand them 
where is your son 


queen gertrude

bestow this place on us a little while 
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
ah  my good lord  what have i seen to night 


king claudius

what  gertrude  how does hamlet 


queen gertrude

mad as the sea and wind  when both contend
which is the mightier  in his lawless fit 
behind the arras hearing something stir 
whips out his rapier  cries   rat  a rat 
and  in this brainish apprehension  kills
the unseen good old man 


king claudius

o heavy deed 
it had been so with us  had we been there 
his liberty is full of threats to all 
to you yourself  to us  to every one 
alas  how shall this bloody deed be answer d 
it will be laid to us  whose providence
should have kept short  restrain and out of haunt 
this mad young man  but so much was our love 
we would not understand what was most fit 
but  like the owner of a foul disease 
to keep it from divulging  let it feed
even on the pith of life  where is he gone 


queen gertrude

to draw apart the body he hath kill d 
o whom his very madness  like some ore
among a mineral of metals base 
shows itself pure  he weeps for what is done 


king claudius

o gertrude  come away 
the sun no sooner shall the mountains touch 
but we will ship him hence  and this vile deed
we must  with all our majesty and skill 
both countenance and excuse  ho  guildenstern 
re enter rosencrantz and guildenstern
friends both  go join you with some further aid 
hamlet in madness hath polonius slain 
and from his mother closet hath he dragg him 
go seek him out  speak fair  and bring the body
into the chapel  i pray you  haste in this 
exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern
come  gertrude  we call up our wisest friends 
and let them know  both what we mean to do 
and what untimely done  o  come away 
my soul is full of discord and dismay 
exeunt
