ay  sir  that soaks up the king countenance  his
rewards  his authorities  but such officers do the
king best service in the end  he keeps them  like
an ape  in the corner of his jaw  first mouthed  to
be last swallowed  when he needs what you have
gleaned  it is but squeezing you  and  sponge  you
shall be dry again

with us to the king

the body is with the king  but the king is not with
the body  the king is a thing

a thing  my lord 


hamlet

of nothing  bring me to him  hide fox  and all after 
exeunt
