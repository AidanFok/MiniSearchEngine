as my great power thereof may give thee sense

pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set
our sovereign process  which imports at full 
by letters congruing to that effect 
the present death of hamlet  do it  england 
for like the hectic in my blood he rages 
and thou must cure me  till i know  done 
howe my haps  my joys were ne begun
