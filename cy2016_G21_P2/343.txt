a compelled valour  and in the grapple i boarded

i alone became their prisoner  they have dealt with
me like thieves of mercy  but they knew what they
did  i am to do a good turn for them  let the king
have the letters i have sent  and repair thou to me
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death  i

dumb  yet are they much too light for the bore of
the matter  these good fellows will bring thee
where i am  rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their
course for england  of them i have much to tell
thee  farewell 
 that thou knowest thine  hamlet 
come  i will make you way for these your letters 
and do the speedier  that you may direct me
to him from whom you brought them
