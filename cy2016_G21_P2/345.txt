enter king claudius and laertes


king claudius

now must your conscience my acquaintance seal 
and you must put me in your heart for friend 
sith you have heard  and with a knowing ear 
that he which hath your noble father slain
pursued my life 


laertes

                  it well appears  but tell me
why you proceeded not against these feats 
so crimeful and so capital in nature 
as by your safety  wisdom  all things else 
you mainly were stirr up 


king claudius

o  for two special reasons 
which may to you  perhaps  seem much unsinew d 
but yet to me they are strong  the queen his mother
lives almost by his looks  and for myself 
my virtue or my plague  be it either which 
she so conjunctive to my life and soul 
that  as the star moves not but in his sphere 
i could not but by her  the other motive 
why to a public count i might not go 
is the great love the general gender bear him 
who  dipping all his faults in their affection 
would  like the spring that turneth wood to stone 
convert his gyves to graces  so that my arrows 
too slightly timber for so loud a wind 
would have reverted to my bow again 
and not where i had aim them 


laertes

and so have i a noble father lost 
a sister driven into desperate terms 
whose worth  if praises may go back again 
stood challenger on mount of all the age
for her perfections  but my revenge will come 


king claudius

break not your sleeps for that  you must not think
that we are made of stuff so flat and dull
that we can let our beard be shook with danger
and think it pastime  you shortly shall hear more 
i loved your father  and we love ourself 
and that  i hope  will teach you to imagine 
enter a messenger
how now  what news 


messenger

letters  my lord  from hamlet 
this to your majesty  this to the queen 


king claudius

from hamlet  who brought them 


messenger

sailors  my lord  they say  i saw them not 
they were given me by claudio  he received them
of him that brought them 


king claudius

laertes  you shall hear them  leave us 
exit messenger
reads
 and mighty  you shall know i am set naked on
your kingdom  to morrow shall i beg leave to see
your kingly eyes  when i shall  first asking your
pardon thereunto  recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return                    hamlet 
what should this mean  are all the rest come back 
or is it some abuse  and no such thing 


laertes

know you the hand 


king claudius

 hamlets character   naked 
and in a postscript here  he says  alone 
can you advise me 


laertes

i lost in it  my lord  but let him come 
it warms the very sickness in my heart 
that i shall live and tell him to his teeth 
 didest thou 


king claudius

if it be so  laertes 
as how should it be so  how otherwise 
will you be ruled by me 


laertes

ay  my lord 
so you will not o me to a peace 


king claudius

to thine own peace  if he be now return d 
as checking at his voyage  and that he means
no more to undertake it  i will work him
to an exploit  now ripe in my device 
under the which he shall not choose but fall 
and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe 
but even his mother shall uncharge the practise
and call it accident 


laertes

my lord  i will be ruled 
the rather  if you could devise it so
that i might be the organ 


king claudius

it falls right 
you have been talk of since your travel much 
and that in hamlet hearing  for a quality
wherein  they say  you shine  your sum of parts
did not together pluck such envy from him
as did that one  and that  in my regard 
of the unworthiest siege 


laertes

what part is that  my lord 


king claudius

a very riband in the cap of youth 
yet needful too  for youth no less becomes
the light and careless livery that it wears
than settled age his sables and his weeds 
importing health and graveness  two months since 
here was a gentleman of normandy 
i seen myself  and served against  the french 
and they can well on horseback  but this gallant
had witchcraft in t  he grew unto his seat 
and to such wondrous doing brought his horse 
as he had been incorpsed and demi natured
with the brave beast  so far he topp my thought 
that i  in forgery of shapes and tricks 
come short of what he did 


laertes

a norman was t 


king claudius

a norman 


laertes

upon my life  lamond 


king claudius

the very same 


laertes

i know him well  he is the brooch indeed
and gem of all the nation 


king claudius

he made confession of you 
and gave you such a masterly report
for art and exercise in your defence
and for your rapier most especially 
that he cried out   be a sight indeed 
if one could match you  the scrimers of their nation 
he swore  had had neither motion  guard  nor eye 
if you opposed them  sir  this report of his
did hamlet so envenom with his envy
that he could nothing do but wish and beg
your sudden coming o er  to play with him 
now  out of this 


laertes

what out of this  my lord 


king claudius

laertes  was your father dear to you 
or are you like the painting of a sorrow 
a face without a heart 


laertes

why ask you this 


king claudius

not that i think you did not love your father 
but that i know love is begun by time 
and that i see  in passages of proof 
time qualifies the spark and fire of it 
there lives within the very flame of love
a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it 
and nothing is at a like goodness still 
for goodness  growing to a plurisy 
dies in his own too much  that we would do
we should do when we would  for this  would  changes
and hath abatements and delays as many
as there are tongues  are hands  are accidents 
and then this  should  is like a spendthrift sigh 
that hurts by easing  but  to the quick o  the ulcer 
hamlet comes back  what would you undertake 
to show yourself your father son in deed
more than in words 


laertes

to cut his throat i  the church 


king claudius

no place  indeed  should murder sanctuarize 
revenge should have no bounds  but  good laertes 
will you do this  keep close within your chamber 
hamlet return shall know you are come home 
we put on those shall praise your excellence
and set a double varnish on the fame
the frenchman gave you  bring you in fine together
and wager on your heads  he  being remiss 
most generous and free from all contriving 
will not peruse the foils  so that  with ease 
or with a little shuffling  you may choose
a sword unbated  and in a pass of practise
requite him for your father 


laertes

i will do t 
and  for that purpose  i anoint my sword 
i bought an unction of a mountebank 
so mortal that  but dip a knife in it 
where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare 
collected from all simples that have virtue
under the moon  can save the thing from death
that is but scratch withal  i touch my point
with this contagion  that  if i gall him slightly 
it may be death 


king claudius

                  let further think of this 
weigh what convenience both of time and means
may fit us to our shape  if this should fail 
and that our drift look through our bad performance 
 better not assay d  therefore this project
should have a back or second  that might hold 
if this should blast in proof  soft  let me see 
we make a solemn wager on your cunnings  i ha t 
when in your motion you are hot and dry 
as make your bouts more violent to that end 
and that he calls for drink  i have prepared him
a chalice for the nonce  whereon but sipping 
if he by chance escape your venom stuck 
our purpose may hold there 
enter queen gertrude
how now  sweet queen 


queen gertrude

one woe doth tread upon another heel 
so fast they follow  your sister drown d  laertes 


laertes

drown d  o  where 


queen gertrude

there is a willow grows aslant a brook 
that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream 
there with fantastic garlands did she come
of crow flowers  nettles  daisies  and long purples
that liberal shepherds give a grosser name 
but our cold maids do dead men fingers call them 
there  on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
clambering to hang  an envious sliver broke 
when down her weedy trophies and herself
fell in the weeping brook  her clothes spread wide 
and  mermaid like  awhile they bore her up 
which time she chanted snatches of old tunes 
as one incapable of her own distress 
or like a creature native and indued
unto that element  but long it could not be
till that her garments  heavy with their drink 
pull the poor wretch from her melodious lay
to muddy death 


laertes

                  alas  then  she is drown d 


queen gertrude

drown d  drown d 


laertes

too much of water hast thou  poor ophelia 
and therefore i forbid my tears  but yet
it is our trick  nature her custom holds 
let shame say what it will  when these are gone 
the woman will be out  adieu  my lord 
i have a speech of fire  that fain would blaze 
but that this folly douts it 
exit


king claudius

let follow  gertrude 
how much i had to do to calm his rage 
now fear i this will give it start again 
therefore let follow
