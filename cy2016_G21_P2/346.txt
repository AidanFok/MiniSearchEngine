in youth  when i did love  did love 
methought it was very sweet 
to contract  o  the time  for  ah  my behove 
o  methought  there was nothing meet 


hamlet

has this fellow no feeling of his business  that he
sings at grave making 


horatio

custom hath made it in him a property of easiness 


hamlet

 e so  the hand of little employment hath
the daintier sense

how the knave jowls it to the ground  as if it were
cain jaw bone  that did the first murder  it
might be the pate of a politician  which this ass
now o er reaches  one that would circumvent god 
might it not

hamlet

or of a courtier  which could say  morrow

lawyer  where be his quiddities now  his quillets 
his cases  his tenures  and his tricks  why does he
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel  and will not tell him of
his action of battery  hum  this fellow might be
in time a great buyer of land  with his statutes 
his recognizances  his fines  his double vouchers 
his recoveries  is this the fine of his fines  and
the recovery of his recoveries  to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt  will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases  and double ones too  than
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures  the
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this box  and must the inheritor himself have no more  ha 


horatio

card  or equivocation will undo us  by the lord 
horatio  these three years i have taken a note of
it  the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier  he
gaffs his kibe  how long hast thou been a
grave maker 


first clown

of all the days i  the year  i came to that day
that our last king hamlet overcame fortinbras

are as mad as he

first clown

why  here in denmark  i have been sexton here  man
and boy  thirty years

have many pocky corses now a days  that will scarce
hold the laying in he will last you some eight year
or nine year  a tanner will last you nine year 


hamlet

why he more than another 


first clown

why  sir  his hide is so tanned with his trade  that
he will keep out water a great while  and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body 
here a skull now  this skull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years 


hamlet

whose was it 


first clown

a whoreson mad fellow it was  whose do you think it was 


hamlet

flagon of rhenish on my head once  this same skull

this 


first clown

hamlet

let me see 
takes the skull
alas  poor yorick  i knew him  horatio  a fellow
of infinite jest  of most excellent fancy  he hath
borne me on his back a thousand times  and now  how
abhorred in my imagination it is  my gorge rims at
it  here hung those lips that i have kissed i know
not how oft  where be your gibes now  your
gambols  your songs  your flashes of merriment 
that were wont to set the table on a roar  not one
now  to mock your own grinning  quite chap fallen 
now get you to my lady chamber  and tell her  let
her paint an inch thick  to this favour she must
come  make her laugh at that  prithee  horatio  tell
me one thing

e so  my lord 


hamlet

to what base uses we may return  horatio  why may
not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander 
till he find it stopping a bung hole 


horatio

 to consider too curiously  to consider so 


hamlet

no  faith  not a jot  but to follow him thither with
modesty enough  and likelihood to lead it  as
thus  alexander died  alexander was buried 
alexander returneth into dust  the dust is earth  of
earth we make loam  and why of that loam  whereto he
was converted  might they not stop a beer barrel 
imperious caesar  dead and turn to clay 
might stop a hole to keep the wind away 
o  that that earth  which kept the world in awe 
should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw 
but soft  but soft  aside  here comes the king 
enter priest     c  in procession  the corpse of  ophelia  laertes and mourners following  king claudius  queen gertrude  their trains     c

first priest

her obsequies have been as far enlarged
as we have warrantise  her death was doubtful 
and  but that great command o the order 
she should in ground unsanctified have lodged
till the last trumpet  for charitable prayers 
shards  flints and pebbles should be thrown on her 
yet here she is allow her virgin crants 
her maiden strewments and the bringing home
of bell and burial 


laertes

must there no more be done 


first priest

no more be done 
we should profane the service of the dead
to sing a requiem and such rest to her
as to peace parted souls 


laertes

lay her i  the earth 
and from her fair and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring  i tell thee  churlish priest 
a ministering angel shall my sister be 
when thou liest howling

what  the fair ophelia 


queen gertrude

scattering flowers

i thought thy bride bed to have deck d  sweet maid 
and not have strew thy grave

o  treble woe
fall ten times treble on that cursed head 
whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
deprived thee of  hold off the earth awhile 
till i have caught her once more in mine arms 
leaps into the grave
now pile your dust upon the quick and dead 
till of this flat a mountain you have made 
to o old pelion  or the skyish head
of blue olympus 


hamlet

 advancing      what is he whose grief
bears such an emphasis  whose phrase of sorrow
conjures the wandering stars  and makes them stand
like wonder wounded hearers  this is i 
hamlet the dane 
leaps into the grave


laertes

                  the devil take thy soul 
grappling with him


hamlet

thou pray not well 
i prithee  take thy fingers from my throat 
for  though i am not splenitive and rash 
yet have i something in me dangerous 
which let thy wiseness fear  hold off thy hand 


king claudius

pluck them asunder 


queen gertrude

                  good my lord  be quiet 
the attendants part them  and they come out of the grave


hamlet

why i will fight with him upon this theme
until my eyelids will no longer wag 


queen gertrude

o my son  what theme 


hamlet

i loved ophelia  forty thousand brothers
could not  with all their quantity of love 
make up my sum  what wilt thou do for her 


king claudius

o  he is mad  laertes

woo weep  woo fight  woo fast  woo tear thyself 
woo drink up eisel  eat a crocodile 
i do t  dost thou come here to whine 
to outface me with leaping in her grave 
be buried quick with her  and so will i 
and  if thou prate of mountains  let them throw
millions of acres on us  till our ground 
singeing his pate against the burning zone 
make ossa like a wart  nay  an thou mouth 
i rant as well as thou 


queen gertrude

this is mere madness 
and thus awhile the fit will work on him 
anon  as patient as the female dove 
when that her golden couplets are disclosed 
his silence will sit drooping 


hamlet

hear you  sir 
what is the reason that you use me thus 
i loved you ever  but it is no matter 
let hercules himself do what he may 
the cat will mew and dog will have his day 
exit


king claudius

i pray you  good horatio  wait upon him 
exit horatio
to laertes
strengthen your patience in our last night speech 
we put the matter to the present push 
good gertrude  set some watch over your son 
this grave shall have a living monument 
an hour of quiet shortly shall we see 
till then  in patience our proceeding be 
exeunt
