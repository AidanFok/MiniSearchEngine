enter hamlet and horatio


hamlet

so much for this  sir  now shall you see the other 
you do remember all the circumstance 


horatio

remember it  my lord 


hamlet

sir  in my heart there was a kind of fighting 
that would not let me sleep  methought i lay
worse than the mutines in the bilboes  rashly 
and praised be rashness for it  let us know 
our indiscretion sometimes serves us well 
when our deep plots do pall  and that should teach us
there a divinity that shapes our ends 
rough hew them how we will 


horatio

that is most certain 


hamlet

up from my cabin 
my sea gown scarf about me  in the dark
groped i to find out them  had my desire 
finger their packet  and in fine withdrew
to mine own room again  making so bold 
my fears forgetting manners  to unseal
their grand commission  where i found  horatio 
o royal knavery an exact command 
larded with many several sorts of reasons
importing denmark health and england too 
with  ho  such bugs and goblins in my life 
that  on the supervise  no leisure bated 
no  not to stay the grinding of the axe 
my head should be struck off 


horatio

is possible 


hamlet

here the commission  read it at more leisure 
but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed 


horatio

i beseech you 


hamlet

being thus be netted round with villanies 
ere i could make a prologue to my brains 
they had begun the play i sat me down 
devised a new commission  wrote it fair 
i once did hold it  as our statists do 
a baseness to write fair and labour much
how to forget that learning  but  sir  now
it did me yeoman service  wilt thou know
the effect of what i wrote 


horatio

ay  good my lord 


hamlet

an earnest conjuration from the king 
as england was his faithful tributary 
as love between them like the palm might flourish 
as peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
and stand a comma  their amities 
and many such like  as of great charge 
that  on the view and knowing of these contents 
without debatement further  more or less 
he should the bearers put to sudden death 
not shriving time allow d 


horatio

how was this seal d 


hamlet

why  even in that was heaven ordinant 
i had my father signet in my purse 
which was the model of that danish seal 
folded the writ up in form of the other 
subscribed it  gave the impression  placed it safely 
the changeling never known  now  the next day
was our sea fight  and what to this was sequent
thou know already 


horatio

so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to t 


hamlet

why  man  they did make love to this employment 
they are not near my conscience  their defeat
does by their own insinuation grow 
 dangerous when the baser nature comes
between the pass and fell incensed points
of mighty opposites 


horatio

why  what a king is this 


hamlet

does it not  think thee  stand me now upon 
he that hath kill my king and whored my mother 
popp in between the election and my hopes 
thrown out his angle for my proper life 
and with such cozenage is not perfect conscience 
to quit him with this arm  and is not to be damn d 
to let this canker of our nature come
in further evil 


horatio

it must be shortly known to him from england
what is the issue of the business there 


hamlet

it will be short  the interim is mine 
and a man life no more than to say  one 
but i am very sorry  good horatio 
that to laertes i forgot myself 
for  by the image of my cause  i see
the portraiture of his  i court his favours 
but  sure  the bravery of his grief did put me
into a towering passion 


horatio

peace  who comes here 
enter osric


osric

your lordship is right welcome back to denmark 


hamlet

i humbly thank you  sir  dost know this water fly 


horatio

no  my good lord 


hamlet

thy state is the more gracious  for  a vice to
know him  he hath much land  and fertile  let a
beast be lord of beasts  and his crib shall stand at
the king mess   a chough  but  as i say 
spacious in the possession of dirt 


osric

sweet lord  if your lordship were at leisure  i
should impart a thing to you from his majesty 


hamlet

i will receive it  sir  with all diligence of
spirit  put your bonnet to his right use   for the head 


osric

i thank your lordship  it is very hot 


hamlet

no  believe me   very cold  the wind is
northerly 


osric

it is indifferent cold  my lord  indeed 


hamlet

but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion 


osric

exceedingly  my lord  it is very sultry as
 twere i cannot tell how  but  my lord  his
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
great wager on your head  sir  this is the matter 


hamlet

i beseech you  remember 
hamlet moves him to put on his hat


osric

nay  good my lord  for mine ease  in good faith 
sir  here is newly come to court laertes  believe
me  an absolute gentleman  full of most excellent
differences  of very soft society and great showing 
indeed  to speak feelingly of him  he is the card or
calendar of gentry  for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see 


hamlet

sir  his definement suffers no perdition in you 
though  i know  to divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory  and yet but yaw
neither  in respect of his quick sail  but  in the
verity of extolment  i take him to be a soul of
great article  and his infusion of such dearth and
rareness  as  to make true diction of him  his
semblable is his mirror  and who else would trace
him  his umbrage  nothing more 


osric

your lordship speaks most infallibly of him 


hamlet

the concernancy  sir  why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath 


osric

sir 


horatio

is not possible to understand in another tongue 
you will do t  sir  really 


hamlet

what imports the nomination of this gentleman 


osric

of laertes 


horatio

his purse is empty already  all golden words are spent 


hamlet

of him  sir 


osric

i know you are not ignorant 


hamlet

i would you did  sir  yet  in faith  if you did 
it would not much approve me  well  sir 


osric

you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is 


hamlet

i dare not confess that  lest i should compare with
him in excellence  but  to know a man well  were to
know himself 


osric

i mean  sir  for his weapon  but in the imputation
laid on him by them  in his meed he unfellowed 


hamlet

what his weapon 


osric

rapier and dagger 


hamlet

that two of his weapons  but  well 


osric

the king  sir  hath wagered with him six barbary
horses  against the which he has imponed  as i take
it  six french rapiers and poniards  with their
assigns  as girdle  hangers  and so  three of the
carriages  in faith  are very dear to fancy  very
responsive to the hilts  most delicate carriages 
and of very liberal conceit 


hamlet

what call you the carriages 


horatio

i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done 


osric

the carriages  sir  are the hangers 


hamlet

the phrase would be more german to the matter  if we
could carry cannon by our sides  i would it might
be hangers till then  but  on  six barbary horses
against six french swords  their assigns  and three
liberal conceited carriages  that the french bet
against the danish  why is this  imponed  as you call it 


osric

the king  sir  hath laid  that in a dozen passes
between yourself and him  he shall not exceed you
three hits  he hath laid on twelve for nine  and it
would come to immediate trial  if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer 


hamlet

how if i answer  no 


osric

i mean  my lord  the opposition of your person in trial 


hamlet

sir  i will walk here in the hall  if it please his
majesty   the breathing time of day with me  let
the foils be brought  the gentleman willing  and the
king hold his purpose  i will win for him an i can 
if not  i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits 


osric

shall i re deliver you e so 


hamlet

to this effect  sir  after what flourish your nature will 


osric

i commend my duty to your lordship 


hamlet

yours  yours 
exit osric
he does well to commend it himself  there are no
tongues else for turn 


horatio

this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head 


hamlet

he did comply with his dug  before he sucked it 
thus has he and many more of the same bevy that i
know the dressy age dotes on only got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter  a kind of
yesty collection  which carries them through and
through the most fond and winnowed opinions  and do
but blow them to their trial  the bubbles are out 
enter a lord


lord

my lord  his majesty commended him to you by young
osric  who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall  he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with laertes  or that you will take longer time 


hamlet

i am constant to my purpose  they follow the king 
pleasure  if his fitness speaks  mine is ready  now
or whensoever  provided i be so able as now 


lord

the king and queen and all are coming down 


hamlet

in happy time 


lord

the queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to laertes before you fall to play 


hamlet

she well instructs me 
exit lord


horatio

you will lose this wager  my lord 


hamlet

i do not think so  since he went into france  i
have been in continual practise  i shall win at the
odds  but thou wouldst not think how ill all here
about my heart  but it is no matter 


horatio

nay  good my lord 


hamlet

it is but foolery  but it is such a kind of
gain giving  as would perhaps trouble a woman 


horatio

if your mind dislike any thing  obey it  i will
forestall their repair hither  and say you are not
fit 


hamlet

not a whit  we defy augury  there a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow  if it be now 
 not to come  if it be not to come  it will be
now  if it be not now  yet it will come  the
readiness is all  since no man has aught of what he
leaves  what is to leave betimes 
enter king claudius  queen gertrude  laertes  lords  osric  and attendants with foils     c


king claudius

come  hamlet  come  and take this hand from me 
king claudius puts laertes  hand into hamlet 


hamlet

give me your pardon  sir  i done you wrong 
but pardon t  as you are a gentleman 
this presence knows 
and you must needs have heard  how i am punish 
with sore distraction  what i have done 
that might your nature  honour and exception
roughly awake  i here proclaim was madness 
was hamlet wrong laertes  never hamlet 
if hamlet from himself be ta away 
and when he not himself does wrong laertes 
then hamlet does it not  hamlet denies it 
who does it  then  his madness  if be so 
hamlet is of the faction that is wrong d 
his madness is poor hamlet enemy 
sir  in this audience 
let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
free me so far in your most generous thoughts 
that i have shot mine arrow o the house 
and hurt my brother 


laertes

i am satisfied in nature 
whose motive  in this case  should stir me most
to my revenge  but in my terms of honour
i stand aloof  and will no reconcilement 
till by some elder masters  of known honour 
i have a voice and precedent of peace 
to keep my name ungored  but till that time 
i do receive your offer love like love 
and will not wrong it 


hamlet

i embrace it freely 
and will this brother wager frankly play 
give us the foils  come on 


laertes

come  one for me 


hamlet

hamlet

your grace hath laid the odds o  the weaker side 


king claudius

i do not fear it  i have seen you both 
but since he is better d  we have therefore odds 


laertes

this is too heavy  let me see another 


hamlet

this likes me well  these foils have all a length 
they prepare to play


osric

ay  my good lord 


king claudius

set me the stoops of wine upon that table 
if hamlet give the first or second hit 
or quit in answer of the third exchange 
let all the battlements their ordnance fire 
the king shall drink to hamlet better breath 
and in the cup an union shall he throw 
richer than that which four successive kings
in denmark crown have worn  give me the cups 
and let the kettle to the trumpet speak 
the trumpet to the cannoneer without 
the cannons to the heavens  the heavens to earth 
 the king dunks to hamlet  come  begin 
and you  the judges  bear a wary eye

dies


hamlet

heaven make thee free of it  i follow thee 
i am dead  horatio  wretched queen  adieu 
you that look pale and tremble at this chance 
that are but mutes or audience to this act 
had i but time as this fell sergeant  death 
is strict in his arrest o  i could tell you 
but let it be  horatio  i am dead 
thou livest  report me and my cause aright
to the unsatisfied 


horatio

never believe it 
i am more an antique roman than a dane 
here yet some liquor left 


hamlet

as thou a man 
give me the cup  let go  by heaven  i have t 
o good horatio  what a wounded name 
things standing thus unknown  shall live behind me 
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
absent thee from felicity awhile 
and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain 
to tell my story 
march afar off  and shot within
what warlike noise is this 


osric

young fortinbras  with conquest come from poland 
to the ambassadors of england gives
this warlike volley 


hamlet

o  i die  horatio 
the potent poison quite o er crows my spirit 
i cannot live to hear the news from england 
but i do prophesy the election lights
on fortinbras  he has my dying voice 
so tell him  with the occurrents  more and less 
which have solicited  the rest is silence 
dies


horatio

now cracks a noble heart  good night sweet prince 
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest 
why does the drum come hither 
march within
enter fortinbras  the english ambassadors  and others


prince fortinbras

where is this sight 


horatio

what is it ye would see 
if aught of woe or wonder  cease your search 


prince fortinbras

this quarry cries on havoc  o proud death 
what feast is toward in thine eternal cell 
that thou so many princes at a shot
so bloodily hast struck 


first ambassador

the sight is dismal 
and our affairs from england come too late 
the ears are senseless that should give us hearing 
to tell him his commandment is fulfill d 
that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead 
where should we have our thanks 


horatio

not from his mouth 
had it the ability of life to thank you 
he never gave commandment for their death 
but since  so jump upon this bloody question 
you from the polack wars  and you from england 
are here arrived give order that these bodies
high on a stage be placed to the view 
and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
how these things came about  so shall you hear
of carnal  bloody  and unnatural acts 
of accidental judgments  casual slaughters 
of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause 
and  in this upshot  purposes mistook
fall on the inventors  reads  all this can i
truly deliver 


prince fortinbras

                  let us haste to hear it 
and call the noblest to the audience 
for me  with sorrow i embrace my fortune 
i have some rights of memory in this kingdom 
which now to claim my vantage doth invite me 


horatio

of that i shall have also cause to speak 
and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more 
but let this same be presently perform d 
even while men minds are wild  lest more mischance
on plots and errors  happen 


prince fortinbras

let four captains
bear hamlet  like a soldier  to the stage 
for he was likely  had he been put on 
to have proved most royally  and  for his passage 
the soldiers  music and the rites of war
speak loudly for him 
take up the bodies  such a sight as this
becomes the field  but here shows much amiss 
go  bid the soldiers shoot 
a dead march  exeunt  bearing off the dead bodies  after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
