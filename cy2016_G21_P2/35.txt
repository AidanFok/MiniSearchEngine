that he is march to bourdeaux with his power 
to fight with talbot  as he march along

york

a plague upon that villain somerset 
that thus delays my promised supply
of horsemen  that were levied for this siege 
renowned talbot doth expect my aid 
and i am lowted by a traitor villain
and cannot help the noble chevalier 
god comfort him in this necessity 
if he miscarry  farewell wars in france 
enter sir william lucy


lucy

thou princely leader of our english strength 
never so needful on the earth of france 
spur to the rescue of the noble talbot 
who now is girdled with a waist of iron
and hemm about with grim destruction 
to bourdeaux  warlike duke  to bourdeaux  york 
else  farewell talbot  france  and england honour 


york

o god  that somerset  who in proud heart
doth stop my cornets  were in talbot place 
so should we save a valiant gentleman
by forfeiting a traitor and a coward 
mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep 
that thus we die  while remiss traitors sleep 


lucy

o  send some succor to the distress lord 


york

he dies  we lose  i break my warlike word 
we mourn  france smiles  we lose  they daily get 
all  of this vile traitor somerset 


lucy

then god take mercy on brave talbot soul 
and on his son young john  who two hours since
i met in travel toward his warlike father 
this seven years did not talbot see his son 
and now they meet where both their lives are done 


york

alas  what joy shall noble talbot have
to bid his young son welcome to his grave 
away  vexation almost stops my breath 
that sunder friends greet in the hour of death 
lucy  farewell  no more my fortune can 
but curse the cause i cannot aid the man 
maine  blois  poictiers  and tours  are won away 
 all of somerset and his delay 
exit  with his soldiers


lucy

thus  while the vulture of sedition
feeds in the bosom of such great commanders 
sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
the conquest of our scarce cold conqueror 
that ever living man of memory 
henry the fifth  whiles they each other cross 
lives  honours  lands and all hurry to loss 
exit
