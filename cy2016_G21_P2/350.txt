chorus

o for a muse of fire  that would ascend
the brightest heaven of invention 
a kingdom for a stage  princes to act
and monarchs to behold the swelling scene 
then should the warlike harry  like himself 
assume the port of mars  and at his heels 
leash in like hounds  should famine  sword and fire
crouch for employment  but pardon  and gentles all 
the flat unraised spirits that have dared
on this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
so great an object  can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of france  or may we cram
within this wooden o the very casques
that did affright the air at agincourt 
o  pardon  since a crooked figure may
attest in little place a million 
and let us  ciphers to this great accompt 
on your imaginary forces work 
suppose within the girdle of these walls
are now confined two mighty monarchies 
whose high upreared and abutting fronts
the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder 
piece out our imperfections with your thoughts 
into a thousand parts divide on man 
and make imaginary puissance 
think when we talk of horses  that you see them
printing their proud hoofs i  the receiving earth 
for  your thoughts that now must deck our kings 
carry them here and there  jumping o times 
turning the accomplishment of many years
into an hour glass  for the which supply 
admit me chorus to this history 
who prologue like your humble patience pray 
gently to hear  kindly to judge  our play
