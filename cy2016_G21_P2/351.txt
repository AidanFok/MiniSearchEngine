scene i  london  an ante chamber in the king palace 


enter the archbishop of canterbury  and the bishop of ely


canterbury

my lord  i tell you  that self bill is urged 
which in the eleventh year of the last king reign
was like  and had indeed against us pass d 
but that the scambling and unquiet time
did push it out of farther question 


ely

but how  my lord  shall we resist it now 


canterbury

it must be thought on  if it pass against us 
we lose the better half of our possession 
for all the temporal lands which men devout
by testament have given to the church
would they strip from us  being valued thus 
as much as would maintain  to the king honour 
full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights 
six thousand and two hundred good esquires 
and  to relief of lazars and weak age 
of indigent faint souls past corporal toil 
a hundred almshouses right well supplied 
and to the coffers of the king beside 
a thousand pounds by the year  thus runs the bill 


ely

this would drink deep 


canterbury

 drink the cup and all 


ely

but what prevention 


canterbury

the king is full of grace and fair regard 


ely

and a true lover of the holy church 


canterbury

the courses of his youth promised it not 
the breath no sooner left his father body 
but that his wildness  mortified in him 
seem to die too  yea  at that very moment
consideration  like an angel  came
and whipp the offending adam out of him 
leaving his body as a paradise 
to envelop and contain celestial spirits 
never was such a sudden scholar made 
never came reformation in a flood 
with such a heady currance  scouring faults
nor never hydra headed wilfulness
so soon did lose his seat and all at once
as in this king 


ely

                  we are blessed in the change 


canterbury

hear him but reason in divinity 
and all admiring with an inward wish
you would desire the king were made a prelate 
hear him debate of commonwealth affairs 
you would say it hath been all in all his study 
list his discourse of war  and you shall hear
a fearful battle render you in music 
turn him to any cause of policy 
the gordian knot of it he will unloose 
familiar as his garter  that  when he speaks 
the air  a charter libertine  is still 
and the mute wonder lurketh in men ears 
to steal his sweet and honey sentences 
so that the art and practic part of life
must be the mistress to this theoric 
which is a wonder how his grace should glean it 
since his addiction was to courses vain 
his companies unletter d  rude and shallow 
his hours fill up with riots  banquets  sports 
and never noted in him any study 
any retirement  any sequestration
from open haunts and popularity 


ely

the strawberry grows underneath the nettle
and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
neighbour by fruit of baser quality 
and so the prince obscured his contemplation
under the veil of wildness  which  no doubt 
grew like the summer grass  fastest by night 
unseen  yet crescive in his faculty 


canterbury

it must be so  for miracles are ceased 
and therefore we must needs admit the means
how things are perfected 


ely

but  my good lord 
how now for mitigation of this bill
urged by the commons  doth his majesty
incline to it  or no 


canterbury

he seems indifferent 
or rather swaying more upon our part
than cherishing the exhibiters against us 
for i have made an offer to his majesty 
upon our spiritual convocation
and in regard of causes now in hand 
which i have open to his grace at large 
as touching france  to give a greater sum
than ever at one time the clergy yet
did to his predecessors part withal 


ely

how did this offer seem received  my lord 


canterbury

with good acceptance of his majesty 
save that there was not time enough to hear 
as i perceived his grace would fain have done 
the severals and unhidden passages
of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
and generally to the crown and seat of france
derived from edward  his great grandfather 


ely

what was the impediment that broke this off 


canterbury

the french ambassador upon that instant
craved audience  and the hour  i think  is come
to give him hearing  is it four o clock 


ely

it is 


canterbury

then go we in  to know his embassy 
which i could with a ready guess declare 
before the frenchman speak a word of it 


ely

i wait upon you  and i long to hear it 
exeunt
