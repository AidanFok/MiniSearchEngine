chorus

now all the youth of england are on fire 
and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies 
now thrive the armourers  and honour thought
reigns solely in the breast of every man 
they sell the pasture now to buy the horse 
following the mirror of all christian kings 
with winged heels  as english mercuries 
for now sits expectation in the air 
and hides a sword from hilts unto the point
with crowns imperial  crowns and coronets 
promised to harry and his followers 
the french  advised by good intelligence
of this most dreadful preparation 
shake in their fear and with pale policy
seek to divert the english purposes 
o england  model to thy inward greatness 
like little body with a mighty heart 
what mightst thou do  that honour would thee do 
were all thy children kind and natural 
but see thy fault  france hath in thee found out
a nest of hollow bosoms  which he fills
with treacherous crowns  and three corrupted men 
one  richard earl of cambridge  and the second 
henry lord scroop of masham  and the third 
sir thomas grey  knight  of northumberland 
have  for the gilt of france o guilt indeed 
confirm conspiracy with fearful france 
and by their hands this grace of kings must die 
if hell and treason hold their promises 
ere he take ship for france  and in southampton 
linger your patience on  and we digest
the abuse of distance  force a play 
the sum is paid  the traitors are agreed 
the king is set from london  and the scene
is now transported  gentles  to southampton 
there is the playhouse now  there must you sit 
and thence to france shall we convey you safe 
and bring you back  charming the narrow seas
to give you gentle pass  for  if we may 
we not offend one stomach with our play 
but  till the king come forth  and not till then 
unto southampton do we shift our scene 
exit
