scene ii  southampton  a council chamber 


enter exeter  bedford  and westmoreland


bedford

 god  his grace is bold  to trust these traitors 


exeter

they shall be apprehended by and by 


westmoreland

how smooth and even they do bear themselves 
as if allegiance in their bosoms sat 
crowned with faith and constant loyalty 


bedford

the king hath note of all that they intend 
by interception which they dream not of 


exeter

nay  but the man that was his bedfellow 
whom he hath dull and cloy with gracious favours 
that he should  for a foreign purse  so sell
his sovereign life to death and treachery 
trumpets sound  enter king henry v  scroop  cambridge  grey  and attendants


king henry v

now sits the wind fair  and we will aboard 
my lord of cambridge  and my kind lord of masham 
and you  my gentle knight  give me your thoughts 
think you not that the powers we bear with us
will cut their passage through the force of france 
doing the execution and the act
for which we have in head assembled them 


scroop

no doubt  my liege  if each man do his best 


king henry v

i doubt not that  since we are well persuaded
we carry not a heart with us from hence
that grows not in a fair consent with ours 
nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
success and conquest to attend on us 


cambridge

never was monarch better fear and loved
than is your majesty  there not  i think  a subject
that sits in heart grief and uneasiness
under the sweet shade of your government 


grey

true  those that were your father enemies
have steep their galls in honey and do serve you
with hearts create of duty and of zeal 


king henry v

we therefore have great cause of thankfulness 
and shall forget the office of our hand 
sooner than quittance of desert and merit
according to the weight and worthiness 


scroop

so service shall with steeled sinews toil 
and labour shall refresh itself with hope 
to do your grace incessant services 


king henry v

we judge no less  uncle of exeter 
enlarge the man committed yesterday 
that rail against our person  we consider
it was excess of wine that set him on 
and on his more advice we pardon him 


scroop

that mercy  but too much security 
let him be punish d  sovereign  lest example
breed  by his sufferance  more of such a kind 


king henry v

o  let us yet be merciful 


cambridge

so may your highness  and yet punish too 


grey

sir 
you show great mercy  if you give him life 
after the taste of much correction 


king henry v

alas  your too much love and care of me
are heavy orisons  this poor wretch 
if little faults  proceeding on distemper 
shall not be wink at  how shall we stretch our eye
when capital crimes  chew d  swallow and digested 
appear before us  we yet enlarge that man 
though cambridge  scroop and grey  in their dear care
and tender preservation of our person 
would have him punished  and now to our french causes 
who are the late commissioners 


cambridge

i one  my lord 
your highness bade me ask for it to day 


scroop

so did you me  my liege 


grey

and i  my royal sovereign 


king henry v

then  richard earl of cambridge  there is yours 
there yours  lord scroop of masham  and  sir knight 
grey of northumberland  this same is yours 
read them  and know  i know your worthiness 
my lord of westmoreland  and uncle exeter 
we will aboard to night  why  how now  gentlemen 
what see you in those papers that you lose
so much complexion  look ye  how they change 
their cheeks are paper  why  what read you there
that hath so cowarded and chased your blood
out of appearance 


cambridge

                  i do confess my fault 
and do submit me to your highness  mercy 


grey

scroop

to which we all appeal 


king henry v

the mercy that was quick in us but late 
by your own counsel is suppress and kill d 
you must not dare  for shame  to talk of mercy 
for your own reasons turn into your bosoms 
as dogs upon their masters  worrying you 
see you  my princes  and my noble peers 
these english monsters  my lord of cambridge here 
you know how apt our love was to accord
to furnish him with all appertinents
belonging to his honour  and this man
hath  for a few light crowns  lightly conspired 
and sworn unto the practises of france 
to kill us here in hampton  to the which
this knight  no less for bounty bound to us
than cambridge is  hath likewise sworn  but  o 
what shall i say to thee  lord scroop  thou cruel 
ingrateful  savage and inhuman creature 
thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels 
that knew the very bottom of my soul 
that almost mightst have coin me into gold 
wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use 
may it be possible  that foreign hire
could out of thee extract one spark of evil
that might annoy my finger   so strange 
that  though the truth of it stands off as gross
as black and white  my eye will scarcely see it 
treason and murder ever kept together 
as two yoke devils sworn to either purpose 
working so grossly in a natural cause 
that admiration did not whoop at them 
but thou   all proportion  didst bring in
wonder to wait on treason and on murder 
and whatsoever cunning fiend it was
that wrought upon thee so preposterously
hath got the voice in hell for excellence 
all other devils that suggest by treasons
do botch and bungle up damnation
with patches  colours  and with forms being fetch 
from glistering semblances of piety 
but he that temper thee bade thee stand up 
gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason 
unless to dub thee with the name of traitor 
if that same demon that hath gull thee thus
should with his lion gait walk the whole world 
he might return to vasty tartar back 
and tell the legions  can never win
a soul so easy as that englishman s 
o  how hast thou with  infected
the sweetness of affiance  show men dutiful 
why  so didst thou  seem they grave and learned 
why  so didst thou  come they of noble family 
why  so didst thou  seem they religious 
why  so didst thou  or are they spare in diet 
free from gross passion or of mirth or anger 
constant in spirit  not swerving with the blood 
garnish and deck in modest complement 
not working with the eye without the ear 
and but in purged judgment trusting neither 
such and so finely bolted didst thou seem 
and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot 
to mark the full fraught man and best indued
with some suspicion  i will weep for thee 
for this revolt of thine  methinks  is like
another fall of man  their faults are open 
arrest them to the answer of the law 
and god acquit them of their practises 


exeter

   i arrest thee of high treason  by the name of
richard earl of cambridge 
i arrest thee of high treason  by the name of
henry lord scroop of masham 
i arrest thee of high treason  by the name of
thomas grey  knight  of northumberland 


scroop

our purposes god justly hath discover d 
and i repent my fault more than my death 
which i beseech your highness to forgive 
although my body pay the price of it 


cambridge

for me  the gold of france did not seduce 
although i did admit it as a motive
the sooner to effect what i intended 
but god be thanked for prevention 
which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice 
beseeching god and you to pardon me 


grey

never did faithful subject more rejoice
at the discovery of most dangerous treason
than i do at this hour joy o myself 
prevented from a damned enterprise 
my fault  but not my body  pardon  sovereign 


king henry v

god quit you in his mercy  hear your sentence 
you have conspired against our royal person 
join with an enemy proclaim and from his coffers
received the golden earnest of our death 
wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter 
his princes and his peers to servitude 
his subjects to oppression and contempt
and his whole kingdom into desolation 
touching our person seek we no revenge 
but we our kingdom safety must so tender 
whose ruin you have sought  that to her laws
we do deliver you  get you therefore hence 
poor miserable wretches  to your death 
the taste whereof  god of his mercy give
you patience to endure  and true repentance
of all your dear offences  bear them hence 
exeunt cambridge  scroop and grey  guarded
now  lords  for france  the enterprise whereof
shall be to you  as us  like glorious 
we doubt not of a fair and lucky war 
since god so graciously hath brought to light
this dangerous treason lurking in our way
to hinder our beginnings  we doubt not now
but every rub is smoothed on our way 
then forth  dear countrymen  let us deliver
our puissance into the hand of god 
putting it straight in expedition 
cheerly to sea  the signs of war advance 
no king of england  if not king of france 
exeunt
