a finer end and went away an it had been any
christom child  a  parted even just between twelve
and one  even at the turning o  the tide  for after
i saw him fumble with the sheets and play with
flowers and smile upon his fingers  ends  i knew
there was but one way  for his nose was as sharp as
a pen  and a  babbled of green fields   now 
sir john  quoth i	 what  man  be o  good
cheer  so a  cried out  god  god  god  three or
four times  now i  to comfort him  bid him a 
should not think of god  i hoped there was no need
to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet  so
a  bade me lay more clothes on his feet  i put my
hand into the bed and felt them  and they were as
cold as any stone  then i felt to his knees  and
they were as cold as any stone  and so upward and
upward  and all was as cold as any stone

he was rheumatic  and talked of the whore of babylon 


boy

do you not remember  a  saw a flea stick upon
bardolph nose  and a  said it was a black soul
burning in hell fire 


bardolph

let us to france  like horse leeches  my boys 
to suck  to suck  the very blood to suck
