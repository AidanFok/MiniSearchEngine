thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
in motion of no less celerity
than that of thought  suppose that you have seen
the well appointed king at hampton pier
embark his royalty  and his brave fleet
with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning 
play with your fancies  and in them behold
upon the hempen tackle ship boys climbing 
hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
to sounds confused  behold the threaden sails 
borne with the invisible and creeping wind 
draw the huge bottoms through the furrow sea 
breasting the lofty surge  o  do but think
you stand upon the ravage and behold
a city on the inconstant billows dancing 
for so appears this fleet majestical 
holding due course to harfleur  follow  follow 
grapple your minds to sternage of this navy 
and leave your england  as dead midnight still 
guarded with grandsires  babies and old women 
either past or not arrived to pith and puissance 
for who is he  whose chin is but enrich 
with one appearing hair  that will not follow
these cull and choice drawn cavaliers to france 
work  work your thoughts  and therein see a siege 
behold the ordnance on their carriages 
with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur 
suppose the ambassador from the french comes back 
tells harry that the king doth offer him
katharine his daughter  and with her  to dowry 
some petty and unprofitable dukedoms 
the offer likes not  and the nimble gunner
with linstock now the devilish cannon touches 
alarum  and chambers go off
and down goes all before them  still be kind 
and eke out our performance with your mind 
exit
