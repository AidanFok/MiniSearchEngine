king henry v

once more unto the breach  dear friends  once more 
or close the wall up with our english dead 
in peace there nothing so becomes a man
as modest stillness and humility 
but when the blast of war blows in our ears 
then imitate the action of the tiger 
stiffen the sinews  summon up the blood 
disguise fair nature with hard favour rage 
then lend the eye a terrible aspect 
let pry through the portage of the head
like the brass cannon  let the brow o it
as fearfully as doth a galled rock
o and jutty his confounded base 
swill with the wild and wasteful ocean 
now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide 
hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
to his full height  on  on  you noblest english 
whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof 
fathers that  like so many alexanders 
have in these parts from morn till even fought
and sheathed their swords for lack of argument 
dishonour not your mothers  now attest
that those whom you call fathers did beget you 
be copy now to men of grosser blood 
and teach them how to war  and you  good yeoman 
whose limbs were made in england  show us here
the mettle of your pasture  let us swear
that you are worth your breeding  which i doubt not 
for there is none of you so mean and base 
that hath not noble lustre in your eyes 
i see you stand like greyhounds in the slips 
straining upon the start  the game afoot 
follow your spirit  and upon this charge
cry  for harry  england  and saint george 
exeunt  alarum  and chambers go off
