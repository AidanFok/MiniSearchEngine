scene iv  other plains in gascony 


enter somerset  with his army  a captain of talbot with him


somerset

it is too late  i cannot send them now 
this expedition was by york and talbot
too rashly plotted  all our general force
might with a sally of the very town
be buckled with  the over daring talbot
hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
by this unheedful  desperate  wild adventure 
york set him on to fight and die in shame 
that  talbot dead  great york might bear the name 


captain

here is sir william lucy  who with me
set from our o ermatch forces forth for aid 
enter sir william lucy


somerset

how now  sir william  whither were you sent 


lucy

whither  my lord  from bought and sold lord talbot 
who  ring about with bold adversity 
cries out for noble york and somerset 
to beat assailing death from his weak legions 
and whiles the honourable captain there
drops bloody sweat from his war wearied limbs 
and  in advantage lingering  looks for rescue 
you  his false hopes  the trust of england honour 
keep off aloof with worthless emulation 
let not your private discord keep away
the levied succors that should lend him aid 
while he  renowned noble gentleman 
yields up his life unto a world of odds 
orleans the bastard  charles  burgundy 
alencon  reignier  compass him about 
and talbot perisheth by your default 


somerset

york set him on  york should have sent him aid 


lucy

and york as fast upon your grace exclaims 
swearing that you withhold his levied host 
collected for this expedition 


somerset

york lies  he might have sent and had the horse 
i owe him little duty  and less love 
and take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending 


lucy

the fraud of england  not the force of france 
hath now entrapp the noble minded talbot 
never to england shall he bear his life 
but dies  betray to fortune by your strife 


somerset

come  go  i will dispatch the horsemen straight 
within six hours they will be at his aid 


lucy

too late comes rescue  he is ta or slain 
for fly he could not  if he would have fled 
and fly would talbot never  though he might 


somerset

if he be dead  brave talbot  then adieu 


lucy

his fame lives in the world  his shame in you
