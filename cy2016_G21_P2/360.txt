enter nym  bardolph  pistol  and boy


bardolph

on  on  on  on  on  to the breach  to the breach 


nym

pray thee  corporal  stay  the knocks are too hot 
and  for mine own part  i have not a case of lives 
the humour of it is too hot  that is the very
plain song of it 


pistol

the plain song is most just  for humours do abound 
knocks go and come  god vassals drop and die 
and sword and shield 
in bloody field 
doth win immortal fame 


boy

would i were in an alehouse in london  i would give
all my fame for a pot of ale and safety 


pistol

and i 
if wishes would prevail with me 
my purpose should not fail with me 
but thither would i hie 


boy

          as duly  but not as truly 
as bird doth sing on bough

up to the breach  you dogs  avaunt  you cullions 
driving them forward


pistol

be merciful  great duke  to men of mould 
abate thy rage  abate thy manly rage 
abate thy rage  great duke 
good bawcock  bate thy rage  use lenity  sweet chuck 


nym

these be good humours  your honour wins bad humours 
exeunt all but boy


boy

as young as i am  i have observed these three
swashers  i am boy to them all three  but all they
three  though they would serve me  could not be man
to me  for indeed three such antics do not amount to
a man  for bardolph  he is white livered and
red faced  by the means whereof a  faces it out  but
fights not  for pistol  he hath a killing tongue
and a quiet sword  by the means whereof a  breaks
words  and keeps whole weapons  for nym  he hath
heard that men of few words are the best men  and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers  lest a 
should be thought a coward  but his few bad words
are matched with as few good deeds  for a  never
broke any man head but his own  and that was
against a post when he was drunk  they will steal
any thing  and call it purchase  bardolph stole a
lute case  bore it twelve leagues  and sold it for
three half pence  nym and bardolph are sworn
brothers in filching  and in calais they stole a
fire shovel  i knew by that piece of service the
men would carry coals  they would have me as
familiar with men pockets as their gloves or their
handkerchers  which makes much against my manhood 
if i should take from another pocket to put into
mine  for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs  i
must leave them  and seek some better service 
their villany goes against my weak stomach  and
therefore i must cast it up
