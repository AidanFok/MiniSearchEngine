king henry v

how yet resolves the governor of the town 
this is the latest parle we will admit 
therefore to our best mercy give yourselves 
or like to men proud of destruction
defy us to our worst  for  as i am a soldier 
a name that in my thoughts becomes me best 
if i begin the battery once again 
i will not leave the half achieved harfleur
till in her ashes she lie buried 
the gates of mercy shall be all shut up 
and the flesh soldier  rough and hard of heart 
in liberty of bloody hand shall range
with conscience wide as hell  mowing like grass
your fresh fair virgins and your flowering infants 
what is it then to me  if impious war 
array in flames like to the prince of fiends 
do  with his smirch complexion  all fell feats
enlink to waste and desolation 
what is to me  when you yourselves are cause 
if your pure maidens fall into the hand
of hot and forcing violation 
what rein can hold licentious wickedness
when down the hill he holds his fierce career 
we may as bootless spend our vain command
upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
as send precepts to the leviathan
to come ashore  therefore  you men of harfleur 
take pity of your town and of your people 
whiles yet my soldiers are in my command 
whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
o the filthy and contagious clouds
of heady murder  spoil and villany 
if not  why  in a moment look to see
the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
defile the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters 
your fathers taken by the silver beards 
and their most reverend heads dash to the walls 
your naked infants spitted upon pikes 
whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
do break the clouds  as did the wives of jewry
at herod bloody hunting slaughtermen 
what say you  will you yield  and this avoid 
or  guilty in defence  be thus destroy d 


governor

our expectation hath this day an end 
the dauphin  whom of succors we entreated 
returns us that his powers are yet not ready
to raise so great a siege  therefore  great king 
we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy 
enter our gates  dispose of us and ours 
for we no longer are defensible 


king henry v

open your gates  come  uncle exeter 
go you and enter harfleur  there remain 
and fortify it strongly  the french 
use mercy to them all  for us  dear uncle 
the winter coming on and sickness growing
upon our soldiers  we will retire to calais 
to night in harfleur we will be your guest 
to morrow for the march are we addrest 
flourish  the king and his train enter the town
