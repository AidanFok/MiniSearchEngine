scene vi  the english camp in picardy 


enter gower and fluellen  meeting


gower

how now  captain fluellen  come you from the bridge 


fluellen

i assure you  there is very excellent services
committed at the bridge 


gower

is the duke of exeter safe 


fluellen

the duke of exeter is as magnanimous as agamemnon 
and a man that i love and honour with my soul  and my
heart  and my duty  and my life  and my living  and
my uttermost power  he is not god be praised and
blessed any hurt in the world  but keeps the
bridge most valiantly  with excellent discipline 
there is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
pridge  i think in my very conscience he is as
valiant a man as mark antony  and he is a man of no
estimation in the world  but did see him do as
gallant service 


gower

what do you call him 


fluellen

he is called aunchient pistol 


gower

i know him not 
enter pistol


fluellen

here is the man 


pistol

captain  i thee beseech to do me favours 
the duke of exeter doth love thee well 


fluellen

ay  i praise god  and i have merited some love at
his hands 


pistol

bardolph  a soldier  firm and sound of heart 
and of buxom valour  hath  by cruel fate 
and giddy fortune furious fickle wheel 
that goddess blind 
that stands upon the rolling restless stone 


fluellen

by your patience  aunchient pistol  fortune is
painted blind  with a muffler afore her eyes  to
signify to you that fortune is blind  and she is
painted also with a wheel  to signify to you  which
is the moral of it  that she is turning  and
inconstant  and mutability  and variation  and her
foot  look you  is fixed upon a spherical stone 
which rolls  and rolls  and rolls  in good truth 
the poet makes a most excellent description of it 
fortune is an excellent moral 


pistol

fortune is bardolph foe  and frowns on him 
for he hath stolen a pax  and hanged must a  be 
a damned death 
let gallows gape for dog  let man go free
and let not hemp his wind pipe suffocate 
but exeter hath given the doom of death
for pax of little price 
therefore  go speak  the duke will hear thy voice 
and let not bardolph vital thread be cut
with edge of penny cord and vile reproach 
speak  captain  for his life  and i will thee requite 


fluellen

aunchient pistol  i do partly understand your meaning 


pistol

why then  rejoice therefore 


fluellen

certainly  aunchient  it is not a thing to rejoice
at  for if  look you  he were my brother  i would
desire the duke to use his good pleasure  and put
him to execution  for discipline ought to be used 


pistol

die and be damn d  and figo for thy friendship 


fluellen

it is well 


pistol

the fig of spain 
exit


fluellen

very good 


gower

why  this is an arrant counterfeit rascal  i
remember him now  a bawd  a cutpurse 


fluellen

i assure you  a  uttered as brave words at the
bridge as you shall see in a summer day  but it
is very well  what he has spoke to me  that is well 
i warrant you  when time is serve 


gower

why   a gull  a fool  a rogue  that now and then
goes to the wars  to grace himself at his return
into london under the form of a soldier  and such
fellows are perfect in the great commanders  names 
and they will learn you by rote where services were
done  at such and such a sconce  at such a breach 
at such a convoy  who came off bravely  who was
shot  who disgraced  what terms the enemy stood on 
and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war 
which they trick up with new tuned oaths  and what
a beard of the general cut and a horrid suit of
the camp will do among foaming bottles and
ale washed wits  is wonderful to be thought on  but
you must learn to know such slanders of the age  or
else you may be marvellously mistook 


fluellen

i tell you what  captain gower  i do perceive he is
not the man that he would gladly make show to the
world he is  if i find a hole in his coat  i will
tell him my mind 
drum heard
hark you  the king is coming  and i must speak with
him from the pridge 
drum and colours  enter king henry  gloucester  and soldiers
god pless your majesty 


king henry v

how now  fluellen  camest thou from the bridge 


fluellen

ay  so please your majesty  the duke of exeter has
very gallantly maintained the pridge  the french is
gone off  look you  and there is gallant and most
prave passages  marry  th  athversary was have
possession of the pridge  but he is enforced to
retire  and the duke of exeter is master of the
pridge  i can tell your majesty  the duke is a
prave man 


king henry v

what men have you lost  fluellen 


fluellen

the perdition of th  athversary hath been very
great  reasonable great  marry  for my part  i
think the duke hath lost never a man  but one that
is like to be executed for robbing a church  one
bardolph  if your majesty know the man  his face is
all bubukles  and whelks  and knobs  and flames o 
fire  and his lips blows at his nose  and it is like
a coal of fire  sometimes plue and sometimes red 
but his nose is executed and his fire out 


king henry v

we would have all such offenders so cut off  and we
give express charge  that in our marches through the
country  there be nothing compelled from the
villages  nothing taken but paid for  none of the
french upbraided or abused in disdainful language 
for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom  the
gentler gamester is the soonest winner 
tucket  enter montjoy


montjoy

you know me by my habit 


king henry v

well then i know thee  what shall i know of thee 


montjoy

my master mind 


king henry v

unfold it 


montjoy

thus says my king  say thou to harry of england 
though we seemed dead  we did but sleep  advantage
is a better soldier than rashness  tell him we
could have rebuked him at harfleur  but that we
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
full ripe  now we speak upon our cue  and our voice
is imperial  england shall repent his folly  see
his weakness  and admire our sufferance  bid him
therefore consider of his ransom  which must
proportion the losses we have borne  the subjects we
have lost  the disgrace we have digested  which in
weight to re answer  his pettiness would bow under 
for our losses  his exchequer is too poor  for the
effusion of our blood  the muster of his kingdom too
faint a number  and for our disgrace  his own
person  kneeling at our feet  but a weak and
worthless satisfaction  to this add defiance  and
tell him  for conclusion  he hath betrayed his
followers  whose condemnation is pronounced  so far
my king and master  so much my office 


king henry v

what is thy name  i know thy quality 


montjoy

montjoy 


king henry v

thou dost thy office fairly  turn thee back 
and tell thy king i do not seek him now 
but could be willing to march on to calais
without impeachment  for  to say the sooth 
though  no wisdom to confess so much
unto an enemy of craft and vantage 
my people are with sickness much enfeebled 
my numbers lessened  and those few i have
almost no better than so many french 
who when they were in health  i tell thee  herald 
i thought upon one pair of english legs
did march three frenchmen  yet  forgive me  god 
that i do brag thus  this your air of france
hath blown that vice in me  i must repent 
go therefore  tell thy master here i am 
my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk 
my army but a weak and sickly guard 
yet  god before  tell him we will come on 
though france himself and such another neighbour
stand in our way  there for thy labour  montjoy 
go bid thy master well advise himself 
if we may pass  we will  if we be hinder d 
we shall your tawny ground with your red blood
discolour  and so montjoy  fare you well 
the sum of all our answer is but this 
we would not seek a battle  as we are 
nor  as we are  we say we will not shun it 
so tell your master 


montjoy

i shall deliver so  thanks to your highness 
exit


gloucester

i hope they will not come upon us now 


king henry v

we are in god hand  brother  not in theirs 
march to the bridge  it now draws toward night 
beyond the river we encamp ourselves 
and on to morrow  bid them march away
