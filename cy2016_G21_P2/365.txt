scene vii  the french camp  near agincourt 


enter the constable of france  the lord rambures  orleans  dauphin  with others


constable

tut  i have the best armour of the world  would it were day 


orleans

you have an excellent armour  but let my horse have his due 


constable

it is the best horse of europe 


orleans

will it never be morning 


dauphin

my lord of orleans  and my lord high constable  you
talk of horse and armour 


orleans

you are as well provided of both as any prince in the world 


dauphin

what a long night is this  i will not change my
horse with any that treads but on four pasterns 
ca  ha  he bounds from the earth  as if his
entrails were hairs  le cheval volant  the pegasus 
chez les narines de feu  when i bestride him  i
soar  i am a hawk  he trots the air  the earth
sings when he touches it  the basest horn of his
hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes 


orleans

he of the colour of the nutmeg 


dauphin

and of the heat of the ginger  it is a beast for
perseus  he is pure air and fire  and the dull
elements of earth and water never appear in him  but
only in patient stillness while his rider mounts
him  he is indeed a horse  and all other jades you
may call beasts 


constable

indeed  my lord  it is a most absolute and excellent horse 


dauphin

it is the prince of palfreys  his neigh is like the
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage 


orleans

no more  cousin 


dauphin

nay  the man hath no wit that cannot  from the
rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb  vary
deserved praise on my palfrey  it is a theme as
fluent as the sea  turn the sands into eloquent
tongues  and my horse is argument for them all 
 a subject for a sovereign to reason on  and for
a sovereign sovereign to ride on  and for the
world  familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
their particular functions and wonder at him  i
once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus 
 of nature 


orleans

i have heard a sonnet begin so to one mistress 


dauphin

then did they imitate that which i composed to my
courser  for my horse is my mistress 


orleans

your mistress bears well 


dauphin

me well  which is the prescript praise and
perfection of a good and particular mistress 


constable

nay  for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
shook your back 


dauphin

so perhaps did yours 


constable

mine was not bridled 


dauphin

o then belike she was old and gentle  and you rode 
like a kern of ireland  your french hose off  and in
your straight strossers 


constable

you have good judgment in horsemanship 


dauphin

be warned by me  then  they that ride so and ride
not warily  fall into foul bogs  i had rather have
my horse to my mistress 


constable

i had as lief have my mistress a jade 


dauphin

i tell thee  constable  my mistress wears his own hair 


constable

i could make as true a boast as that  if i had a sow
to my mistress 


dauphin

 chien est retourne a son propre vomissement  et
la truie lavee au bourbier  thou makest use of any thing 


constable

yet do i not use my horse for my mistress  or any
such proverb so little kin to the purpose 


rambures

my lord constable  the armour that i saw in your tent
to night  are those stars or suns upon it 


constable

stars  my lord 


dauphin

some of them will fall to morrow  i hope 


constable

and yet my sky shall not want 


dauphin

that may be  for you bear a many superfluously  and
 more honour some were away 


constable

even as your horse bears your praises  who would
trot as well  were some of your brags dismounted 


dauphin

would i were able to load him with his desert  will
it never be day  i will trot to morrow a mile  and
my way shall be paved with english faces 


constable

i will not say so  for fear i should be faced out of
my way  but i would it were morning  for i would
fain be about the ears of the english 


rambures

who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners 


constable

you must first go yourself to hazard  ere you have them 


dauphin

 midnight  i go arm myself 
exit


orleans

the dauphin longs for morning 


rambures

he longs to eat the english 


constable

i think he will eat all he kills 


orleans

by the white hand of my lady  he a gallant prince 


constable

swear by her foot  that she may tread out the oath 


orleans

he is simply the most active gentleman of france 


constable

doing is activity  and he will still be doing 


orleans

he never did harm  that i heard of 


constable

nor will do none to morrow  he will keep that good name still 


orleans

i know him to be valiant 


constable

i was told that  by one that knows him better than
you 


orleans

what he 


constable

marry  he told me so himself  and he said he cared
not who knew it


orleans

he needs not  it is no hidden virtue in him 


constable

by my faith  sir  but it is  never any body saw it
but his lackey   a hooded valour  and when it
appears  it will bate 


orleans

ill will never said well 


constable

i will cap that proverb with  is flattery in friendship 


orleans

and i will take up that with  the devil his due 


constable

well placed  there stands your friend for the
devil  have at the very eye of that proverb with  
pox of the devil 


orleans

you are the better at proverbs  by how much  
fool bolt is soon shot 


constable

you have shot over 


orleans

 not the first time you were overshot 
enter a messenger


messenger

my lord high constable  the english lie within
fifteen hundred paces of your tents 


constable

who hath measured the ground 


messenger

the lord grandpre 


constable

a valiant and most expert gentleman  would it were
day  alas  poor harry of england  he longs not for
the dawning as we do 


orleans

what a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
england  to mope with his fat brained followers so
far out of his knowledge 


constable

if the english had any apprehension  they would run away 


orleans

that they lack  for if their heads had any
intellectual armour  they could never wear such heavy
head pieces 


rambures

that island of england breeds very valiant
creatures  their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage 


orleans

foolish curs  that run winking into the mouth of a
russian bear and have their heads crushed like
rotten apples  you may as well say  that a
valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion 


constable

just  just  and the men do sympathize with the
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on  leaving
their wits with their wives  and then give them
great meals of beef and iron and steel  they will
eat like wolves and fight like devils 


orleans

ay  but these english are shrewdly out of beef 


constable

then shall we find to morrow they have only stomachs
to eat and none to fight  now is it time to arm 
come  shall we about it 


orleans

it is now two o clock  but  let me see  by ten
we shall have each a hundred englishmen
