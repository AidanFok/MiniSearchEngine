chorus

now entertain conjecture of a time
when creeping murmur and the poring dark
fills the wide vessel of the universe 
from camp to camp through the foul womb of night
the hum of either army stilly sounds 
that the fixed sentinels almost receive
the secret whispers of each other watch 
fire answers fire  and through their paly flames
each battle sees the other umber face 
steed threatens steed  in high and boastful neighs
piercing the night dull ear  and from the tents
the armourers  accomplishing the knights 
with busy hammers closing rivets up 
give dreadful note of preparation 
the country cocks do crow  the clocks do toll 
and the third hour of drowsy morning name 
proud of their numbers and secure in soul 
the confident and over lusty french
do the low rated english play at dice 
and chide the cripple tardy gaited night
who  like a foul and ugly witch  doth limp
so tediously away  the poor condemned english 
like sacrifices  by their watchful fires
sit patiently and inly ruminate
the morning danger  and their gesture sad
investing lank lean  cheeks and war worn coats
presenteth them unto the gazing moon
so many horrid ghosts  o now  who will behold
the royal captain of this ruin band
walking from watch to watch  from tent to tent 
let him cry  and glory on his head 
for forth he goes and visits all his host 
bids them good morrow with a modest smile
and calls them brothers  friends and countrymen 
upon his royal face there is no note
how dread an army hath enrounded him 
nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
unto the weary and all watched night 
but freshly looks and over bears attaint
with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty 
that every wretch  pining and pale before 
beholding him  plucks comfort from his looks 
a largess universal like the sun
his liberal eye doth give to every one 
thawing cold fear  that mean and gentle all 
behold  as may unworthiness define 
a little touch of harry in the night 
and so our scene must to the battle fly 
where o for pity we shall much disgrace
with four or five most vile and ragged foils 
right ill disposed in brawl ridiculous 
the name of agincourt  yet sit and see 
minding true things by what their mockeries be
