the sun doth gild our armour  up  my lords

montez a cheval  my horse  varlet  laquais  ha

enter constable
now  my lord constable 


constable

hark  how our steeds for present service neigh 


dauphin

mount them  and make incision in their hides 
that their hot blood may spin in english eyes 
and dout them with superfluous courage  ha 


rambures

what  will you have them weep our horses  blood 
how shall we  then  behold their natural tears 
enter messenger


messenger

the english are embattled  you french peers 


constable

to horse  you gallant princes  straight to horse 
do but behold yon poor and starved band 
and your fair show shall suck away their souls 
leaving them but the shales and husks of men 
there is not work enough for all our hands 
scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
to give each naked curtle axe a stain 
that our french gallants shall to day draw out 
and sheathe for lack of sport  let us but blow on them 
the vapour of our valour will o them 
 positive  all exceptions  lords 
that our superfluous lackeys and our peasants 
who in unnecessary action swarm
about our squares of battle  were enow
to purge this field of such a hilding foe 
though we upon this mountain basis by
took stand for idle speculation 
but that our honours must not  what to say 
a very little little let us do 
and all is done  then let the trumpets sound
the tucket sonance and the note to mount 
for our approach shall so much dare the field
that england shall couch down in fear and yield 
enter grandpre


grandpre

why do you stay so long  my lords of france 
yon island carrions  desperate of their bones 
ill favouredly become the morning field 
their ragged curtains poorly are let loose 
and our air shakes them passing scornfully 
big mars seems bankrupt in their beggar host
and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps 
the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks 
with torch staves in their hand  and their poor jades
lob down their heads  dropping the hides and hips 
the gum down roping from their pale dead eyes
and in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
lies foul with chew grass  still and motionless 
and their executors  the knavish crows 
fly o them  all impatient for their hour 
description cannot suit itself in words
to demonstrate the life of such a battle
in life so lifeless as it shows itself 


constable

they have said their prayers  and they stay for death 


dauphin

shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
and give their fasting horses provender 
and after fight with them 


constable

i stay but for my guidon  to the field 
i will the banner from a trumpet take 
and use it for my haste  come  come  away 
the sun is high  and we outwear the day 
exeunt
