scene iii  the english camp 


enter gloucester  bedford  exeter  erpingham  with all his host  salisbury and westmoreland


gloucester

where is the king 


bedford

the king himself is rode to view their battle 


westmoreland

of fighting men they have full three score thousand 


exeter

there five to one  besides  they all are fresh 


salisbury

god arm strike with us   a fearful odds 
god be wi  you  princes all  i to my charge 
if we no more meet till we meet in heaven 
then  joyfully  my noble lord of bedford 
my dear lord gloucester  and my good lord exeter 
and my kind kinsman  warriors all  adieu 


bedford

farewell  good salisbury  and good luck go with thee 


exeter

farewell  kind lord  fight valiantly to day 
and yet i do thee wrong to mind thee of it 
for thou art framed of the firm truth of valour 
exit salisbury


bedford

he is full of valour as of kindness 
princely in both 
enter the king


westmoreland

                  o that we now had here
but one ten thousand of those men in england
that do no work to day 


king henry v

what he that wishes so 
my cousin westmoreland  no  my fair cousin 
if we are mark to die  we are enow
to do our country loss  and if to live 
the fewer men  the greater share of honour 
god will  i pray thee  wish not one man more 
by jove  i am not covetous for gold 
nor care i who doth feed upon my cost 
it yearns me not if men my garments wear 
such outward things dwell not in my desires 
but if it be a sin to covet honour 
i am the most offending soul alive 
no  faith  my coz  wish not a man from england 
god peace  i would not lose so great an honour
as one man more  methinks  would share from me
for the best hope i have  o  do not wish one more 
rather proclaim it  westmoreland  through my host 
that he which hath no stomach to this fight 
let him depart  his passport shall be made
and crowns for convoy put into his purse 
we would not die in that man company
that fears his fellowship to die with us 
this day is called the feast of crispian 
he that outlives this day  and comes safe home 
will stand a tip toe when the day is named 
and rouse him at the name of crispian 
he that shall live this day  and see old age 
will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours 
and say  to morrow is saint crispian 
then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars 
and say  wounds i had on crispin day 
old men forget  yet all shall be forgot 
but he remember with advantages
what feats he did that day  then shall our names 
familiar in his mouth as household words
harry the king  bedford and exeter 
warwick and talbot  salisbury and gloucester 
be in their flowing cups freshly remember d 
this story shall the good man teach his son 
and crispin crispian shall ne go by 
from this day to the ending of the world 
but we in it shall be remember d 
we few  we happy few  we band of brothers 
for he to day that sheds his blood with me
shall be my brother  be he ne so vile 
this day shall gentle his condition 
and gentlemen in england now a bed
shall think themselves accursed they were not here 
and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
that fought with us upon saint crispin day 
re enter salisbury


salisbury

my sovereign lord  bestow yourself with speed 
the french are bravely in their battles set 
and will with all expedience charge on us 


king henry v

all things are ready  if our minds be so 


westmoreland

perish the man whose mind is backward now 


king henry v

thou dost not wish more help from england  coz 


westmoreland

god will  my liege  would you and i alone 
without more help  could fight this royal battle 


king henry v

why  now thou hast unwish five thousand men 
which likes me better than to wish us one 
you know your places  god be with you all 
tucket  enter montjoy


montjoy

once more i come to know of thee  king harry 
if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound 
before thy most assured overthrow 
for certainly thou art so near the gulf 
thou needs must be englutted  besides  in mercy 
the constable desires thee thou wilt mind
thy followers of repentance  that their souls
may make a peaceful and a sweet retire
from off these fields  where  wretches  their poor bodies
must lie and fester 


king henry v

who hath sent thee now 


montjoy

the constable of france 


king henry v

i pray thee  bear my former answer back 
bid them achieve me and then sell my bones 
good god  why should they mock poor fellows thus 
the man that once did sell the lion skin
while the beast lived  was killed with hunting him 
a many of our bodies shall no doubt
find native graves  upon the which  i trust 
shall witness live in brass of this day work 
and those that leave their valiant bones in france 
dying like men  though buried in your dunghills 
they shall be famed  for there the sun shall greet them 
and draw their honours reeking up to heaven 
leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime 
the smell whereof shall breed a plague in france 
mark then abounding valour in our english 
that being dead  like to the bullet grazing 
break out into a second course of mischief 
killing in relapse of mortality 
let me speak proudly  tell the constable
we are but warriors for the working day 
our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch 
with rainy marching in the painful field 
there not a piece of feather in our host 
good argument  i hope  we will not fly 
and time hath worn us into slovenry 
but  by the mass  our hearts are in the trim 
and my poor soldiers tell me  yet ere night
they be in fresher robes  or they will pluck
the gay new coats o the french soldiers  heads
and turn them out of service  if they do this 
as  if god please  they shall my ransom then
will soon be levied  herald  save thou thy labour 
come thou no more for ransom  gentle herald 
they shall have none  i swear  but these my joints 
which if they have as i will leave  them 
shall yield them little  tell the constable 


montjoy

i shall  king harry  and so fare thee well 
thou never shalt hear herald any more 
exit


king henry v

i fear thou once more come again for ransom 
enter york


york

my lord  most humbly on my knee i beg
the leading of the vaward 


king henry v

take it  brave york  now  soldiers  march away 
and how thou pleasest  god  dispose the day 
exeunt
