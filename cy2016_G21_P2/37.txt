scene v  the english camp near bourdeaux 


enter talbot and john his son


talbot

o young john talbot  i did send for thee
to tutor thee in stratagems of war 
that talbot name might be in thee revived
when sapless age and weak unable limbs
should bring thy father to his drooping chair 
but  o malignant and ill boding stars 
now thou art come unto a feast of death 
a terrible and unavoided danger 
therefore  dear boy  mount on my swiftest horse 
and i direct thee how thou shalt escape
by sudden flight  come  dally not  be gone 


john talbot

is my name talbot  and am i your son 
and shall i fly  o if you love my mother 
dishonour not her honourable name 
to make a bastard and a slave of me 
the world will say  he is not talbot blood 
that basely fled when noble talbot stood 


talbot

fly  to revenge my death  if i be slain 


john talbot

he that flies so will ne return again 


talbot

if we both stay  we both are sure to die 


john talbot

then let me stay  and  father  do you fly 
your loss is great  so your regard should be 
my worth unknown  no loss is known in me 
upon my death the french can little boast 
in yours they will  in you all hopes are lost 
flight cannot stain the honour you have won 
but mine it will  that no exploit have done 
you fled for vantage  everyone will swear 
but  if i bow  they say it was for fear 
there is no hope that ever i will stay 
if the first hour i shrink and run away 
here on my knee i beg mortality 
rather than life preserved with infamy 


talbot

shall all thy mother hopes lie in one tomb 


john talbot

ay  rather than i shame my mother womb 


talbot

upon my blessing  i command thee go 


john talbot

to fight i will  but not to fly the foe 


talbot

part of thy father may be saved in thee 


john talbot

no part of him but will be shame in me 


talbot

thou never hadst renown  nor canst not lose it 


john talbot

yes  your renowned name  shall flight abuse it 


talbot

thy father charge shall clear thee from that stain 


john talbot

you cannot witness for me  being slain 
if death be so apparent  then both fly 


talbot

and leave my followers here to fight and die 
my age was never tainted with such shame 


john talbot

and shall my youth be guilty of such blame 
no more can i be sever from your side 
than can yourself yourself in twain divide 
stay  go  do what you will  the like do i 
for live i will not  if my father die 


talbot

then here i take my leave of thee  fair son 
born to eclipse thy life this afternoon 
come  side by side together live and die 
and soul with soul from france to heaven fly
