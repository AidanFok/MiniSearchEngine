scene vi  another part of the field 


alarums  enter king henry and forces  exeter  and others


king henry v

well have we done  thrice valiant countrymen 
but all not done  yet keep the french the field 


exeter

the duke of york commends him to your majesty 


king henry v

lives he  good uncle  thrice within this hour
i saw him down  thrice up again and fighting 
from helmet to the spur all blood he was 


exeter

in which array  brave soldier  doth he lie 
larding the plain  and by his bloody side 
yoke fellow to his honour owing wounds 
the noble earl of suffolk also lies 
suffolk first died  and york  all haggled over 
comes to him  where in gore he lay insteep d 
and takes him by the beard  kisses the gashes
that bloodily did spawn upon his face 
and cries aloud  tarry  dear cousin suffolk 
my soul shall thine keep company to heaven 
tarry  sweet soul  for mine  then fly abreast 
as in this glorious and well foughten field
we kept together in our chivalry 
upon these words i came and cheer him up 
he smiled me in the face  raught me his hand 
and  with a feeble gripe  says  my lord 
commend my service to me sovereign 
so did he turn and over suffolk neck
he threw his wounded arm and kiss his lips 
and so espoused to death  with blood he seal 
a testament of noble ending love 
the pretty and sweet manner of it forced
those waters from me which i would have stopp d 
but i had not so much of man in me 
and all my mother came into mine eyes
and gave me up to tears 


king henry v

i blame you not 
for  hearing this  i must perforce compound
with mistful eyes  or they will issue too 
alarum
but  hark  what new alarum is this same 
the french have reinforced their scatter men 
then every soldier kill his prisoners 
give the word through 
exeunt
