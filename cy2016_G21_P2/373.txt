gower

 certain there not a boy left alive  and the
cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha  done
this slaughter  besides  they have burned and
carried away all that was in the king tent 
wherefore the king  most worthily  hath caused every
soldier to cut his prisoner throat  o   a
gallant king

great  or the mighty  or the huge  or the
magnanimous  are all one reckonings  save the phrase
is a little variations 


gower

i think alexander the great was born in macedon  his
father was called philip of macedon  as i take it 


fluellen

i think it is in macedon where alexander is porn  i
tell you  captain  if you look in the maps of the
 orld  i warrant you sall find  in the comparisons
between macedon and monmouth  that the situations 
look you  is both alike  there is a river in
macedon  and there is also moreover a river at
monmouth  it is called wye at monmouth  but it is
out of my prains what is the name of the other
river  but  all one   alike as my fingers is
to my fingers  and there is salmons in both  if you
mark alexander life well  harry of monmouth life
is come after it indifferent well  for there is
figures in all things  alexander  god knows  and
you know  in his rages  and his furies  and his
wraths  and his cholers  and his moods  and his
displeasures  and his indignations  and also being a
little intoxicates in his prains  did  in his ales and
his angers  look you  kill his best friend  cleitus 


gower

our king is not like him in that  he never killed
any of his friends 


fluellen

it is not well done  mark you now take the tales out
of my mouth  ere it is made and finished  i speak
but in the figures and comparisons of it  as
alexander killed his friend cleitus  being in his
ales and his cups  so also harry monmouth  being in
his right wits and his good judgments  turned away
the fat knight with the great belly doublet  he
was full of jests  and gipes  and knaveries  and
mocks  i have forgot his name

that we may wander o this bloody field
to look our dead  and then to bury them 
to sort our nobles from our common men 
for many of our princes woe the while 
lie drown and soak in mercenary blood 
so do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
in blood of princes  and their wounded steeds
fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage
yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters 
killing them twice  o  give us leave  great king 
to view the field in safety and dispose
of their dead bodies
