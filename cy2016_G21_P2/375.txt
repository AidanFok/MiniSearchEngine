vouchsafe to those that have not read the story 
that i may prompt them  and of such as have 
i humbly pray them to admit the excuse
of time  of numbers and due course of things 
which cannot in their huge and proper life
be here presented  now we bear the king
toward calais  grant him there  there seen 
heave him away upon your winged thoughts
athwart the sea  behold  the english beach
pales in the flood with men  with wives and boys 
whose shouts and claps out voice the deep mouth sea 
which like a mighty whiffler  the king
seems to prepare his way  so let him land 
and solemnly see him set on to london 
so swift a pace hath thought that even now
you may imagine him upon blackheath 
where that his lords desire him to have borne
his bruised helmet and his bended sword
before him through the city  he forbids it 
being free from vainness and self glorious pride 
giving full trophy  signal and ostent
quite from himself to god  but now behold 
in the quick forge and working house of thought 
how london doth pour out her citizens 
the mayor and all his brethren in best sort 
like to the senators of the antique rome 
with the plebeians swarming at their heels 
go forth and fetch their conquering caesar in 
as  by a lower but loving likelihood 
were now the general of our gracious empress 
as in good time he may  from ireland coming 
bringing rebellion broached on his sword 
how many would the peaceful city quit 
to welcome him  much more  and much more cause 
did they this harry  now in london place him 
as yet the lamentation of the french
invites the king of england stay at home 
the emperor coming in behalf of france 
to order peace between them  and omit
all the occurrences  whatever chanced 
till harry back return again to france 
there must we bring him  and myself have play 
the interim  by remembering you  past 
then brook abridgment  and your eyes advance 
after your thoughts  straight back again to france 
exit
