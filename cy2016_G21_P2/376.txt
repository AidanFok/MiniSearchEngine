predeceased valour and dare not avouch in your deeds
any of your words  i have seen you gleeking and
galling at this gentleman twice or thrice  you
thought  because he could not speak english in the
native garb  he could not therefore handle an
english cudgel  you find it otherwise  and
henceforth let a welsh correction teach you a good
english condition  fare ye well

of malady of france 
and there my rendezvous is quite cut off 
old i do wax  and from my weary limbs
honour is cudgelled  well  bawd i turn 
and something lean to cutpurse of quick hand 
to england will i steal  and there i steal 
and patches will i get unto these cudgell scars 
and swear i got them in the gallia wars
