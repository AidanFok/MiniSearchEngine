most worthy brother england  fairly met

queen isabel

so happy be the issue  brother england 
of this good day and of this gracious meeting 
as we are now glad to behold your eyes 
your eyes  which hitherto have borne in them
against the french  that met them in their bent 
the fatal balls of murdering basilisks 
the venom of such looks  we fairly hope 
have lost their quality  and that this day
shall change all griefs and quarrels into love 


king henry v

to cry amen to that  thus we appear 


queen isabel

you english princes all  i do salute you 


burgundy

my duty to you both  on equal love 
great kings of france and england  that i have labour d 
with all my wits  my pains and strong endeavours 
to bring your most imperial majesties
unto this bar and royal interview 
your mightiness on both parts best can witness 
since then my office hath so far prevail 
that  face to face and royal eye to eye 
you have congreeted  let it not disgrace me 
if i demand  before this royal view 
what rub or what impediment there is 
why that the naked  poor and mangled peace 
dear nurse of arts and joyful births 
should not in this best garden of the world
our fertile france  put up her lovely visage 
alas  she hath from france too long been chased 
and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps 
corrupting in its own fertility 
her vine  the merry cheerer of the heart 
unpruned dies  her hedges even pleach d 
like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair 
put forth disorder twigs  her fallow leas
the darnel  hemlock and rank fumitory
doth root upon  while that the coulter rusts
that should deracinate such savagery 
the even mead  that erst brought sweetly forth
the freckled cowslip  burnet and green clover 
wanting the scythe  all uncorrected  rank 
conceives by idleness and nothing teems
but hateful docks  rough thistles  kecksies  burs 
losing both beauty and utility 
and as our vineyards  fallows  meads and hedges 
defective in their natures  grow to wildness 
even so our houses and ourselves and children
have lost  or do not learn for want of time 
the sciences that should become our country 
but grow like savages as soldiers will
that nothing do but meditate on blood 
to swearing and stern looks  diffused attire
and every thing that seems unnatural 
which to reduce into our former favour
you are assembled  and my speech entreats
that i may know the let  why gentle peace
should not expel these inconveniences
and bless us with her former qualities 


king henry v

if  duke of burgundy  you would the peace 
whose want gives growth to the imperfections
which you have cited  you must buy that peace
with full accord to all our just demands 
whose tenors and particular effects
you have enscheduled briefly in your hands 


burgundy

the king hath heard them  to the which as yet
there is no answer made 


king henry v

well then the peace 
which you before so urged  lies in his answer 


king of france

i have but with a cursorary eye
o the articles  pleaseth your grace
to appoint some of your council presently
to sit with us once more  with better heed
to re survey them  we will suddenly
pass our accept and peremptory answer 


king henry v

brother  we shall  go  uncle exeter 
and brother clarence  and you  brother gloucester 
warwick and huntingdon  go with the king 
and take with you free power to ratify 
augment  or alter  as your wisdoms best
shall see advantageable for our dignity 
any thing in or out of our demands 
and we consign thereto  will you  fair sister 
go with the princes  or stay here with us 


queen isabel

our gracious brother  i will go with them 
haply a woman voice may do some good 
when articles too nicely urged be stood on 


king henry v

yet leave our cousin katharine here with us 
she is our capital demand  comprised
within the fore rank of our articles 


queen isabel

she hath good leave 
exeunt all except henry  katharine  and alice


king henry v

fair katharine  and most fair 
will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
such as will enter at a lady ear
and plead his love suit to her gentle heart 


katharine

your majesty shall mock at me  i cannot speak your england 


king henry v

o fair katharine  if you will love me soundly with
your french heart  i will be glad to hear you
confess it brokenly with your english tongue  do
you like me  kate 


katharine

pardonnez moi  i cannot tell vat is  me 


king henry v

an angel is like you  kate  and you are like an angel 


katharine

que dit il  que je suis semblable a les anges 


alice

oui  vraiment  sauf votre grace  ainsi dit il 


king henry v

i said so  dear katharine  and i must not blush to
affirm it 


katharine

o bon dieu  les langues des hommes sont pleines de
tromperies 


king henry v

what says she  fair one  that the tongues of men
are full of deceits 


alice

oui  dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
deceits  dat is de princess 


king henry v

the princess is the better englishwoman  i  faith 
kate  my wooing is fit for thy understanding  i am
glad thou canst speak no better english  for  if
thou couldst  thou wouldst find me such a plain king
that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my
crown  i know no ways to mince it in love  but
directly to say  love you  then if you urge me
farther than to say  you in faith  i wear out
my suit  give me your answer  i  faith  do  and so
clap hands and a bargain  how say you  lady 


katharine

sauf votre honneur  me understand vell 


king henry v

marry  if you would put me to verses or to dance for
your sake  kate  why you undid me  for the one  i
have neither words nor measure  and for the other  i
have no strength in measure  yet a reasonable
measure in strength  if i could win a lady at
leap frog  or by vaulting into my saddle with my
armour on my back  under the correction of bragging
be it spoken  i should quickly leap into a wife 
or if i might buffet for my love  or bound my horse
for her favours  i could lay on like a butcher and
sit like a jack an apes  never off  but  before god 
kate  i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
eloquence  nor i have no cunning in protestation 
only downright oaths  which i never use till urged 
nor never break for urging  if thou canst love a
fellow of this temper  kate  whose face is not worth
sun burning  that never looks in his glass for love
of any thing he sees there  let thine eye be thy
cook  i speak to thee plain soldier  if thou canst
love me for this  take me  if not  to say to thee
that i shall die  is true  but for thy love  by the
lord  no  yet i love thee too  and while thou
livest  dear kate  take a fellow of plain and
uncoined constancy  for he perforce must do thee
right  because he hath not the gift to woo in other
places  for these fellows of infinite tongue  that
can rhyme themselves into ladies  favours  they do
always reason themselves out again  what  a
speaker is but a prater  a rhyme is but a ballad  a
good leg will fall  a straight back will stoop  a
black beard will turn white  a curled pate will grow
bald  a fair face will wither  a full eye will wax
hollow  but a good heart  kate  is the sun and the
moon  or  rather  the sun  and not the moon  for it
shines bright and never changes  but keeps his
course truly  if thou would have such a one  take
me  and take me  take a soldier  take a soldier 
take a king  and what sayest thou then to my love 
speak  my fair  and fairly  i pray thee 


katharine

is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france 


king henry v

no  it is not possible you should love the enemy of
france  kate  but  in loving me  you should love
the friend of france  for i love france so well that
i will not part with a village of it  i will have it
all mine  and  kate  when france is mine and i am
yours  then yours is france and you are mine 


katharine

i cannot tell vat is dat 


king henry v

no  kate  i will tell thee in french  which i am
sure will hang upon my tongue like a new married
wife about her husband neck  hardly to be shook
off  je quand sur le possession de france  et quand
vous avez le possession de moi let me see  what
then  saint denis be my speed donc votre est
france et vous etes mienne  it is as easy for me 
kate  to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much
more french  i shall never move thee in french 
unless it be to laugh at me 


katharine

sauf votre honneur  le francois que vous parlez  il
est meilleur que l lequel je parle 


king henry v

no  faith  is not  kate  but thy speaking of my
tongue  and i thine  most truly falsely  must needs
be granted to be much at one  but  kate  dost thou
understand thus much english  canst thou love me 


katharine

i cannot tell 


king henry v

can any of your neighbours tell  kate  i ask
them  come  i know thou lovest me  and at night 
when you come into your closet  you question this
gentlewoman about me  and i know  kate  you will to
her dispraise those parts in me that you love with
your heart  but  good kate  mock me mercifully  the
rather  gentle princess  because i love thee
cruelly  if ever thou beest mine  kate  as i have a
saving faith within me tells me thou shalt  i get
thee with scambling  and thou must therefore needs
prove a good soldier breeder  shall not thou and i 
between saint denis and saint george  compound a
boy  half french  half english  that shall go to
constantinople and take the turk by the beard 
shall we not  what sayest thou  my fair
flower de luce 


katharine

i do not know dat


king henry v

no   hereafter to know  but now to promise  do
but now promise  kate  you will endeavour for your
french part of such a boy  and for my english moiety
take the word of a king and a bachelor  how answer
you  la plus belle katharine du monde  mon tres cher
et devin deesse 


katharine

your majestee ave fausse french enough to deceive de
most sage demoiselle dat is en france 


king henry v

now  fie upon my false french  by mine honour  in
true english  i love thee  kate  by which honour i
dare not swear thou lovest me  yet my blood begins to
flatter me that thou dost  notwithstanding the poor
and untempering effect of my visage  now  beshrew
my father ambition  he was thinking of civil wars
when he got me  therefore was i created with a
stubborn outside  with an aspect of iron  that  when
i come to woo ladies  i fright them  but  in faith 
kate  the elder i wax  the better i shall appear 
my comfort is  that old age  that ill layer up of
beauty  can do no more  spoil upon my face  thou
hast me  if thou hast me  at the worst  and thou
shalt wear me  if thou wear me  better and better 
and therefore tell me  most fair katharine  will you
have me  put off your maiden blushes  avouch the
thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress 
take me by the hand  and say  of england i am
thine  which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine
ear withal  but i will tell thee aloud  is
thine  ireland is thine  france is thine  and harry
plantagenet is thine  who though i speak it before
his face  if he be not fellow with the best king 
thou shalt find the best king of good fellows 
come  your answer in broken music  for thy voice is
music and thy english broken  therefore  queen of
all  katharine  break thy mind to me in broken
english  wilt thou have me 


katharine

dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere 


king henry v

nay  it will please him well  kate it shall please
him  kate 


katharine

den it sall also content me 


king henry v

upon that i kiss your hand  and i call you my queen 


katharine

laissez  mon seigneur  laissez  laissez  ma foi  je
ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en
baisant la main d de votre seigeurie indigne
serviteur  excusez moi  je vous supplie  mon
tres puissant seigneur 


king henry v

then i will kiss your lips  kate 


katharine

les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant
leur noces  il n pas la coutume de france 


king henry v

madam my interpreter  what says she 


alice

dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
france i cannot tell vat is baiser en anglish 


king henry v

to kiss 


alice

your majesty entendre bettre que moi 


king henry v

it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss
before they are married  would she say 


alice

oui  vraiment 


king henry v

o kate  nice customs curtsy to great kings  dear
kate  you and i cannot be confined within the weak
list of a country fashion  we are the makers of
manners  kate  and the liberty that follows our
places stops the mouth of all find faults  as i will
do yours  for upholding the nice fashion of your
country in denying me a kiss  therefore  patiently
and yielding 
kissing her
you have witchcraft in your lips  kate  there is
more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
tongues of the french council  and they should
sooner persuade harry of england than a general
petition of monarchs  here comes your father 
re enter the french king and his queen  burgundy  and other lords


burgundy

god save your majesty  my royal cousin  teach you
our princess english 


king henry v

i would have her learn  my fair cousin  how
perfectly i love her  and that is good english 


burgundy

is she not apt 


king henry v

our tongue is rough  coz  and my condition is not
smooth  so that  having neither the voice nor the
heart of flattery about me  i cannot so conjure up
the spirit of love in her  that he will appear in
his true likeness 


burgundy

pardon the frankness of my mirth  if i answer you
for that  if you would conjure in her  you must
make a circle  if conjure up love in her in his true
likeness  he must appear naked and blind  can you
blame her then  being a maid yet rosed over with the
virgin crimson of modesty  if she deny the
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
self  it were  my lord  a hard condition for a maid
to consign to 


king henry v

yet they do wink and yield  as love is blind and enforces 


burgundy

they are then excused  my lord  when they see not
what they do 


king henry v

then  good my lord  teach your cousin to consent winking 


burgundy

i will wink on her to consent  my lord  if you will
teach her to know my meaning  for maids  well
summered and warm kept  are like flies at
bartholomew tide  blind  though they have their
eyes  and then they will endure handling  which
before would not abide looking on 


king henry v

this moral ties me over to time and a hot summer 
and so i shall catch the fly  your cousin  in the
latter end and she must be blind too 


burgundy

as love is  my lord  before it loves 


king henry v

it is so  and you may  some of you  thank love for
my blindness  who cannot see many a fair french city
for one fair french maid that stands in my way 


french king

yes  my lord  you see them perspectively  the cities
turned into a maid  for they are all girdled with
maiden walls that war hath never entered 


king henry v

shall kate be my wife 


french king

so please you 


king henry v

i am content  so the maiden cities you talk of may
wait on her  so the maid that stood in the way for
my wish shall show me the way to my will 


french king

we have consented to all terms of reason 


king henry v

is so  my lords of england 


westmoreland

the king hath granted every article 
his daughter first  and then in sequel all 
according to their firm proposed natures 


exeter

only he hath not yet subscribed this 
where your majesty demands  that the king of france 
having any occasion to write for matter of grant 
shall name your highness in this form and with this
addition in french  notre trescher fils henri  roi
d angleterre  heritier de france  and thus in
latin  praeclarissimus filius noster henricus  rex
angliae  et haeres franciae 


french king

nor this i have not  brother  so denied 
but your request shall make me let it pass 


king henry v

i pray you then  in love and dear alliance 
let that one article rank with the rest 
and thereupon give me your daughter 


french king

take her  fair son  and from her blood raise up
issue to me  that the contending kingdoms
of france and england  whose very shores look pale
with envy of each other happiness 
may cease their hatred  and this dear conjunction
plant neighbourhood and christian like accord
in their sweet bosoms  that never war advance
his bleeding sword  england and fair france 


all

amen 


king henry v

now  welcome  kate  and bear me witness all 
that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen 
flourish


queen isabel

god  the best maker of all marriages 
combine your hearts in one  your realms in one 
as man and wife  being two  are one in love 
so be there  your kingdoms such a spousal 
that never may ill office  or fell jealousy 
which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage 
thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms 
to make divorce of their incorporate league 
that english may as french  french englishmen 
receive each other  god speak this amen 


all

amen 


king henry v

prepare we for our marriage on which day 
my lord of burgundy  we take your oath 
and all the peers  for surety of our leagues 
then shall i swear to kate  and you to me 
and may our oaths well kept and prosperous be 
sennet  exeunt
epilogue
enter chorus


chorus

thus far  with rough and all unable pen 
our bending author hath pursued the story 
in little room confining mighty men 
mangling by starts the full course of their glory 
small time  but in that small most greatly lived
this star of england  fortune made his sword 
by which the world best garden be achieved 
and of it left his son imperial lord 
henry the sixth  in infant bands crown king
of france and england  did this king succeed 
whose state so many had the managing 
that they lost france and made his england bleed 
which oft our stage hath shown  and  for their sake 
in your fair minds let this acceptance take 
exit
