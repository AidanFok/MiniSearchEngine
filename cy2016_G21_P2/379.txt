buckingham

good morrow  and well met  how have ye done
since last we saw in france 


norfolk

i thank your grace 
healthful  and ever since a fresh admirer
of what i saw there 


buckingham

an untimely ague
stay me a prisoner in my chamber when
those suns of glory  those two lights of men 
met in the vale of andren 


norfolk

 guynes and arde 
i was then present  saw them salute on horseback 
beheld them  when they lighted  how they clung
in their embracement  as they grew together 
which had they  what four throned ones could have weigh 
such a compounded one 


buckingham

all the whole time
i was my chamber prisoner 


norfolk

then you lost
the view of earthly glory  men might say 
till this time pomp was single  but now married
to one above itself  each following day
became the next day master  till the last
made former wonders its  to day the french 
all clinquant  all in gold  like heathen gods 
shone down the english  and  to morrow  they
made britain india  every man that stood
show like a mine  their dwarfish pages were
as cherubins  all guilt  the madams too 
not used to toil  did almost sweat to bear
the pride upon them  that their very labour
was to them as a painting  now this masque
was cried incomparable  and the ensuing night
made it a fool and beggar  the two kings 
equal in lustre  were now best  now worst 
as presence did present them  him in eye 
still him in praise  and  being present both
 said they saw but one  and no discerner
durst wag his tongue in censure  when these suns 
for so they phrase  em by their heralds challenged
the noble spirits to arms  they did perform
beyond thought compass  that former fabulous story 
being now seen possible enough  got credit 
that bevis was believed 


buckingham

o  you go far 


norfolk

as i belong to worship and affect
in honour honesty  the tract of every thing
would by a good discourser lose some life 
which action self was tongue to  all was royal 
to the disposing of it nought rebell d 
order gave each thing view  the office did
distinctly his full function 


buckingham

who did guide 
i mean  who set the body and the limbs
of this great sport together  as you guess 


norfolk

one  certes  that promises no element
in such a business 


buckingham

i pray you  who  my lord 


norfolk

all this was order by the good discretion
of the right reverend cardinal of york 


buckingham

the devil speed him  no man pie is freed
from his ambitious finger  what had he
to do in these fierce vanities  i wonder
that such a keech can with his very bulk
take up the rays o  the beneficial sun
and keep it from the earth 


norfolk

surely  sir 
there in him stuff that puts him to these ends 
for  being not propp by ancestry  whose grace
chalks successors their way  nor call upon
for high feats done to the crown  neither allied
for eminent assistants  but  spider like 
out of his self drawing web  he gives us note 
the force of his own merit makes his way
a gift that heaven gives for him  which buys
a place next to the king 


abergavenny

i cannot tell
what heaven hath given him let some graver eye
pierce into that  but i can see his pride
peep through each part of him  whence has he that 
if not from hell  the devil is a niggard 
or has given all before  and he begins
a new hell in himself 


buckingham

why the devil 
upon this french going out  took he upon him 
without the privity o  the king  to appoint
who should attend on him  he makes up the file
of all the gentry  for the most part such
to whom as great a charge as little honour
he meant to lay upon  and his own letter 
the honourable board of council out 
must fetch him in the papers 


abergavenny

i do know
kinsmen of mine  three at the least  that have
by this so sickened their estates  that never
they shall abound as formerly 


buckingham

o  many
have broke their backs with laying manors on  
for this great journey  what did this vanity
but minister communication of
a most poor issue 


norfolk

                  grievingly i think 
the peace between the french and us not values
the cost that did conclude it 


buckingham

every man 
after the hideous storm that follow d  was
a thing inspired  and  not consulting  broke
into a general prophecy  that this tempest 
dashing the garment of this peace  aboded
the sudden breach on t 


norfolk

which is budded out 
for france hath flaw the league  and hath attach 
our merchants  goods at bourdeaux 


abergavenny

is it therefore
the ambassador is silenced 


norfolk

marry  is t 


abergavenny

a proper title of a peace  and purchased
at a superfluous rate 


buckingham

why  all this business
our reverend cardinal carried 


norfolk

like it your grace 
the state takes notice of the private difference
betwixt you and the cardinal  i advise you 
and take it from a heart that wishes towards you
honour and plenteous safety that you read
the cardinal malice and his potency
together  to consider further that
what his high hatred would effect wants not
a minister in his power  you know his nature 
that he revengeful  and i know his sword
hath a sharp edge  it long and   may be said 
it reaches far  and where  not extend 
thither he darts it  bosom up my counsel 
you find it wholesome  lo  where comes that rock
that i advise your shunning 
enter cardinal wolsey  the purse borne before him   certain of the guard  and two secretaries with  papers  cardinal wolsey in his passage fixeth his  eye on buckingham  and buckingham on him  both full of disdain


cardinal wolsey

the duke of buckingham surveyor  ha 
where his examination 


first secretary

here  so please you 


cardinal wolsey

is he in person ready 


first secretary

ay  please your grace 


cardinal wolsey

well  we shall then know more  and buckingham
shall lessen this big look 
exeunt cardinal wolsey and his train


buckingham

this butcher cur is venom mouth d  and i
have not the power to muzzle him  therefore best
not wake him in his slumber  a beggar book
outworths a noble blood 


norfolk

what  are you chafed 
ask god for temperance  that the appliance only
which your disease requires 


buckingham

i read in looks
matter against me  and his eye reviled
me  as his abject object  at this instant
he bores me with some trick  he gone to the king 
i follow and outstare him 


norfolk

stay  my lord 
and let your reason with your choler question
what  you go about  to climb steep hills
requires slow pace at first  anger is like
a full hot horse  who being allow his way 
self mettle tires him  not a man in england
can advise me like you  be to yourself
as you would to your friend 


buckingham

i to the king 
and from a mouth of honour quite cry down
this ipswich fellow insolence  or proclaim
there difference in no persons 


norfolk

be advised 
heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
that it do singe yourself  we may outrun 
by violent swiftness  that which we run at 
and lose by over running  know you not 
the fire that mounts the liquor til run o er 
in seeming to augment it wastes it  be advised 
i say again  there is no english soul
more stronger to direct you than yourself 
if with the sap of reason you would quench 
or but allay  the fire of passion 


buckingham

sir 
i am thankful to you  and i go along
by your prescription  but this top proud fellow 
whom from the flow of gall i name not but
from sincere motions  by intelligence 
and proofs as clear as founts in july when
we see each grain of gravel  i do know
to be corrupt and treasonous 


norfolk

say not  treasonous 


buckingham

to the king i say t  and make my vouch as strong
as shore of rock  attend  this holy fox 
or wolf  or both for he is equal ravenous
as he is subtle  and as prone to mischief
as able to perform t  his mind and place
infecting one another  yea  reciprocally 
only to show his pomp as well in france
as here at home  suggests the king our master
to this last costly treaty  the interview 
that swallow so much treasure  and like a glass
did break i  the rinsing 


norfolk

faith  and so it did 


buckingham

pray  give me favour  sir  this cunning cardinal
the articles o  the combination drew
as himself pleased  and they were ratified
as he cried  let be  to as much end
as give a crutch to the dead  but our count cardinal
has done this  and  well  for worthy wolsey 
who cannot err  he did it  now this follows 
which  as i take it  is a kind of puppy
to the old dam  treason charles the emperor 
under pretence to see the queen his aunt 
for  indeed his colour  but he came
to whisper wolsey here makes visitation 
his fears were  that the interview betwixt
england and france might  through their amity 
breed him some prejudice  for from this league
peep harms that menaced him  he privily
deals with our cardinal  and  as i trow 
which i do well  for i am sure the emperor
paid ere he promised  whereby his suit was granted
ere it was ask d  but when the way was made 
and paved with gold  the emperor thus desired 
that he would please to alter the king course 
and break the foresaid peace  let the king know 
as soon he shall by me  that thus the cardinal
does buy and sell his honour as he pleases 
and for his own advantage 


norfolk

i am sorry
to hear this of him  and could wish he were
something mistaken in t 


buckingham

no  not a syllable 
i  do pronounce him in that very shape
he shall appear in proof 
enter brandon  a sergeant at arms before him  and two or three of the guard


brandon

your office  sergeant  execute it 


sergeant

sir 
my lord the duke of buckingham  and earl
of hereford  stafford  and northampton  i
arrest thee of high treason  in the name
of our most sovereign king 


buckingham

lo  you  my lord 
the net has fall upon me  i shall perish
under device and practise 


brandon

i am sorry
to see you ta from liberty  to look on
the business present   his highness  pleasure
you shall to the tower 


buckingham

it will help me nothing
to plead mine innocence  for that dye is on me
which makes my whitest part black  the will of heaven
be done in this and all things  i obey 
o my lord abergavenny  fare you well 


brandon

nay  he must bear you company  the king
to abergavenny
is pleased you shall to the tower  till you know
how he determines further 


abergavenny

by me obey d 


brandon

                  here is a warrant from
the king to attach lord montacute  and the bodies
of the duke confessor  john de la car 
one gilbert peck  his chancellor 


buckingham

whose figure even this instant cloud puts on 
by darkening my clear sun  my lord  farewell
