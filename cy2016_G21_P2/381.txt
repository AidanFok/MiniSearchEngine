men into such strange mysteries 


sands

new customs 
though they be never so ridiculous 
nay  let  be unmanly  yet are follow d 


chamberlain

as far as i see  all the good our english
have got by the late voyage is but merely
a fit or two o  the face  but they are shrewd ones 
for when they hold  em  you would swear directly
their very noses had been counsellors
to pepin or clotharius  they keep state so 


sands

they have all new legs  and lame ones  one would take it 
that never saw  pace before  the spavin
or springhalt reign among  em

that  sure  they worn out christendom

i hear of none  but the new proclamation
that clapp upon the court gate 


chamberlain

what is for 


lovell

the reformation of our travell gallants 
that fill the court with quarrels  talk  and tailors 


chamberlain

i glad  there  now i would pray our monsieurs
to think an english courtier may be wise 
and never see the louvre 


lovell

they must either 
for so run the conditions  leave those remnants
of fool and feather that they got in france 
with all their honourable point of ignorance
pertaining thereunto  as fights and fireworks 
abusing better men than they can be 
out of a foreign wisdom  renouncing clean
the faith they have in tennis  and tall stockings 
short blister breeches  and those types of travel 
and understand again like honest men 
or pack to their old playfellows  there  i take it 
they may   privilegio  wear away
the lag end of their lewdness and be laugh at 


sands

 time to give  physic  their diseases
are grown so catching 


chamberlain

what a loss our ladies
will have of these trim vanities 


lovell

ay  marry 
there will be woe indeed  lords  the sly whoresons
have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies 
a french song and a fiddle has no fellow 


sands

the devil fiddle  em  i am glad they are going 
for  sure  there no converting of  em  now
an honest country lord  as i am  beaten
a long time out of play  may bring his plainsong
and have an hour of hearing  and  by lady 
held current music too 


chamberlain

chamberlain

o   true 
this night he makes a supper  and a great one 
to many lords and ladies  there will be
the beauty of this kingdom  i assure you 


lovell

that churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed 
a hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us 
his dews fall every where 


chamberlain

no doubt he noble 
he had a black mouth that said other of him 


sands

he may  my lord  has wherewithal  in him
sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine 
men of his way should be most liberal 
they are set here for examples 


chamberlain

true  they are so 
but few now give so great ones  my barge stays 
your lordship shall along  come  good sir thomas 
we shall be late else  which i would not be 
for i was spoke to  with sir henry guildford
this night to be comptrollers 


sands

i am your lordship s
