because they speak no english  thus they pray 
to tell your grace  that  having heard by fame
of this so noble and so fair assembly
this night to meet here  they could do no less
out of the great respect they bear to beauty 
but leave their flocks  and  under your fair conduct 
crave leave to view these ladies and entreat
an hour of revels with  em

more worthy this place than myself  to whom

whispers the masquers


cardinal wolsey
