scene iii  an ante chamber of the queen apartments 


enter anne and an old lady


anne

not for that neither  here the pang that pinches 
his highness having lived so long with her  and she
so good a lady that no tongue could ever
pronounce dishonour of her  by my life 
she never knew harm doing  o  now  after
so many courses of the sun enthroned 
still growing in a majesty and pomp  the which
to leave a thousand fold more bitter than
 sweet at first to acquire after this process 
to give her the avaunt  it is a pity
would move a monster 


old lady

hearts of most hard temper
melt and lament for her 


anne

o  god will  much better
she ne had known pomp  though be temporal 
yet  if that quarrel  fortune  do divorce
it from the bearer   a sufferance panging
as soul and body severing 


old lady

alas  poor lady 
she a stranger now again 


anne

so much the more
must pity drop upon her  verily 
i swear   better to be lowly born 
and range with humble livers in content 
than to be perk up in a glistering grief 
and wear a golden sorrow 


old lady

our content
is our best having 


anne

by my troth and maidenhead 
i would not be a queen 


old lady

beshrew me  i would 
and venture maidenhead for t  and so would you 
for all this spice of your hypocrisy 
you  that have so fair parts of woman on you 
have too a woman heart  which ever yet
affected eminence  wealth  sovereignty 
which  to say sooth  are blessings  and which gifts 
saving your mincing  the capacity
of your soft cheveril conscience would receive 
if you might please to stretch it 


anne

nay  good troth 


old lady

yes  troth  and troth  you would not be a queen 


anne

no  not for all the riches under heaven 
old lady 	 strange  a three pence bow would hire me 
old as i am  to queen it  but  i pray you 
what think you of a duchess  have you limbs
to bear that load of title 


anne

no  in truth 


old lady

then you are weakly made  pluck off a little 
i would not be a young count in your way 
for more than blushing comes to  if your back
cannot vouchsafe this burthen too weak
ever to get a boy 


anne

                  how you do talk 
i swear again  i would not be a queen
for all the world 


old lady

                  in faith  for little england
you venture an emballing  i myself
would for carnarvonshire  although there long 
no more to the crown but that  lo  who comes here 
enter chamberlain


chamberlain

good morrow  ladies  what were worth to know
the secret of your conference 


anne

my good lord 
not your demand  it values not your asking 
our mistress  sorrows we were pitying 


chamberlain

it was a gentle business  and becoming
the action of good women  there is hope
all will be well 


anne

                  now  i pray god  amen 


chamberlain

you bear a gentle mind  and heavenly blessings
follow such creatures  that you may  fair lady 
perceive i speak sincerely  and high note 
ta of your many virtues  the king majesty
commends his good opinion of you  and
does purpose honour to you no less flowing
than marchioness of pembroke  to which title
a thousand pound a year  annual support 
out of his grace he adds 


anne

i do not know
what kind of my obedience i should tender 
more than my all is nothing  nor my prayers
are not words duly hallow d  nor my wishes
more worth than empty vanities  yet prayers and wishes
are all i can return  beseech your lordship 
vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience 
as from a blushing handmaid  to his highness 
whose health and royalty i pray for 


chamberlain

lady 
i shall not fail to approve the fair conceit
the king hath of you 
aside
i have perused her well 
beauty and honour in her are so mingled
that they have caught the king  and who knows yet
but from this lady may proceed a gem
to lighten all this isle  i to the king 
and say i spoke with you 
exit chamberlain


anne

my honour lord 


old lady

why  this it is  see  see 
i have been begging sixteen years in court 
am yet a courtier beggarly  nor could
come pat betwixt too early and too late
for any suit of pounds  and you  o fate 
a very fresh fish here fie  fie  fie upon
this compell fortune have your mouth fill up
before you open it 


anne

this is strange to me 


old lady

how tastes it  is it bitter  forty pence  no 
there was a lady once   an old story 
that would not be a queen  that would she not 
for all the mud in egypt  have you heard it 


anne

come  you are pleasant 


old lady

with your theme  i could
o the lark  the marchioness of pembroke 
a thousand pounds a year for pure respect 
no other obligation  by my life 
that promises moe thousands  honour train
is longer than his foreskirt  by this time
i know your back will bear a duchess  say 
are you not stronger than you were 


anne

good lady 
make yourself mirth with your particular fancy 
and leave me out on t  would i had no being 
if this salute my blood a jot  it faints me 
to think what follows 
the queen is comfortless  and we forgetful
in our long absence  pray  do not deliver
what here you heard to her 


old lady

what do you think me
