sir  i desire you do me right and justice 
and to bestow your pity on me  for
i am a most poor woman  and a stranger 
born out of your dominions  having here
no judge indifferent  nor no more assurance
of equal friendship and proceeding  alas  sir 
in what have i offended you  what cause
hath my behavior given to your displeasure 
that thus you should proceed to put me off 
and take your good grace from me  heaven witness 
i have been to you a true and humble wife 
at all times to your will conformable 
ever in fear to kindle your dislike 
yea  subject to your countenance  glad or sorry
as i saw it inclined  when was the hour
i ever contradicted your desire 
or made it not mine too  or which of your friends
have i not strove to love  although i knew
he were mine enemy  what friend of mine
that had to him derived your anger  did i
continue in my liking  nay  gave notice
he was from thence discharged  sir  call to mind
that i have been your wife  in this obedience 
upward of twenty years  and have been blest
with many children by you  if  in the course
and process of this time  you can report 
and prove it too  against mine honour aught 
my bond to wedlock  or my love and duty 
against your sacred person  in god name 
turn me away  and let the foul contempt
shut door upon me  and so give me up
to the sharp kind of justice  please you sir 
the king  your father  was reputed for
a prince most prudent  of an excellent
and unmatch wit and judgment  ferdinand 
my father  king of spain  was reckon one
the wisest prince that there had reign by many
a year before  it is not to be question 
that they had gather a wise council to them
of every realm  that did debate this business 
who deem our marriage lawful  wherefore i humbly
beseech you  sir  to spare me  till i may
be by my friends in spain advised  whose counsel
i will implore  if not  i  the name of god 
your pleasure be fulfill d 


cardinal wolsey

you have here  lady 
and of your choice  these reverend fathers  men
of singular integrity and learning 
yea  the elect o  the land  who are assembled
to plead your cause  it shall be therefore bootless
that longer you desire the court  as well
for your own quiet  as to rectify
what is unsettled in the king 


cardinal campeius

his grace
hath spoken well and justly  therefore  madam 
it fit this royal session do proceed 
and that  without delay  their arguments
be now produced and heard

cardinal wolsey

                  your pleasure  madam 


queen katharine

sir 
i am about to weep  but  thinking that
we are a queen  or long have dream so  certain
the daughter of a king  my drops of tears
i turn to sparks of fire 


cardinal wolsey

be patient yet 


queen katharine

i will  when you are humble  nay  before 
or god will punish me  i do believe 
induced by potent circumstances  that
you are mine enemy  and make my challenge
you shall not be my judge  for it is you
have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me 
which god dew quench  therefore i say again 
i utterly abhor  yea  from my soul
refuse you for my judge  whom  yet once more 
i hold my most malicious foe  and think not
at all a friend to truth 


cardinal wolsey

i do profess
you speak not like yourself  who ever yet
have stood to charity  and display the effects
of disposition gentle  and of wisdom
o woman power  madam  you do me wrong 
i have no spleen against you  nor injustice
for you or any  how far i have proceeded 
or how far further shall  is warranted
by a commission from the consistory 
yea  the whole consistory of rome  you charge me
that i have blown this coal  i do deny it 
the king is present  if it be known to him
that i gainsay my deed  how may he wound 
and worthily  my falsehood  yea  as much
as you have done my truth  if he know
that i am free of your report  he knows
i am not of your wrong  therefore in him
it lies to cure me  and the cure is  to
remove these thoughts from you  the which before
his highness shall speak in  i do beseech
you  gracious madam  to unthink your speaking
and to say so no more 


queen katharine

my lord  my lord 
i am a simple woman  much too weak
to oppose your cunning  you meek and
humble mouth d 
you sign your place and calling  in full seeming 
with meekness and humility  but your heart
is cramm with arrogancy  spleen  and pride 
you have  by fortune and his highness  favours 
gone slightly o low steps and now are mounted
where powers are your retainers  and your words 
domestics to you  serve your will as please
yourself pronounce their office  i must tell you 
you tender more your person honour than
your high profession spiritual  that again
i do refuse you for my judge  and here 
before you all  appeal unto the pope 
to bring my whole cause  his holiness 
and to be judged by him 
she curtsies to king henry viii  and offers to depart


cardinal campeius

the queen is obstinate 
stubborn to justice  apt to accuse it  and
disdainful to be tried by t   not well 
she going away 


king henry viii

call her again

king henry viii

go thy ways  kate 
that man i  the world who shall report he has
a better wife  let him in nought be trusted 
for speaking false in that  thou art  alone 
if thy rare qualities  sweet gentleness 
thy meekness saint like  wife like government 
obeying in commanding  and thy parts
sovereign and pious else  could speak thee out 
the queen of earthly queens  she noble born 
and  like her true nobility  she has
carried herself towards me 


cardinal wolsey

most gracious sir 
in humblest manner i require your highness 
that it shall please you to declare  in hearing
of all these ears for where i am robb and bound 
there must i be unloosed  although not there
at once and fully satisfied whether ever i
did broach this business to your highness  or
laid any scruple in your way  which might
induce you to the question on t  or ever
have to you  but with thanks to god for such
a royal lady  spake one the least word that might
be to the prejudice of her present state 
or touch of her good person 


king henry viii

my lord cardinal 
i do excuse you  yea  upon mine honour 
i free you from t  you are not to be taught
that you have many enemies  that know not
why they are so  but  like to village curs 
bark when their fellows do  by some of these
the queen is put in anger  you excused 
but will you be more justified  you ever
have wish the sleeping of this business  never desired
it to be stirr d  but oft have hinder d  oft 
the passages made toward it  on my honour 
i speak my good lord cardinal to this point 
and thus far clear him  now  what moved me to t 
i will be bold with time and your attention 
then mark the inducement  thus it came  give heed to t 
my conscience first received a tenderness 
scruple  and prick  on certain speeches utter 
by the bishop of bayonne  then french ambassador 
who had been hither sent on the debating
a marriage  the duke of orleans and
our daughter mary  i  the progress of this business 
ere a determinate resolution  he 
i mean the bishop  did require a respite 
wherein he might the king his lord advertise
whether our daughter were legitimate 
respecting this our marriage with the dowager 
sometimes our brother wife  this respite shook
the bosom of my conscience  enter me 
yea  with a splitting power  and made to tremble
the region of my breast  which forced such way 
that many mazed considerings did throng
and press in with this caution  first  methought
i stood not in the smile of heaven  who had
commanded nature  that my lady womb 
if it conceived a male child by me  should
do no more offices of life to than
the grave does to the dead  for her male issue
or died where they were made  or shortly after
this world had air them  hence i took a thought 
this was a judgment on me  that my kingdom 
well worthy the best heir o  the world  should not
be gladded in by me  then follows  that
i weigh the danger which my realms stood in
by this my issue fail  and that gave to me
many a groaning throe  thus hulling in
the wild sea of my conscience  i did steer
toward this remedy  whereupon we are
now present here together  that to say 
i meant to rectify my conscience which
i then did feel full sick  and yet not well 
by all the reverend fathers of the land
and doctors learn d  first i began in private
with you  my lord of lincoln  you remember
how under my oppression i did reek 
when i first moved you 


lincoln

very well  my liege 


king henry viii

i have spoke long  be pleased yourself to say
how far you satisfied me 


lincoln

so please your highness 
the question did at first so stagger me 
bearing a state of mighty moment in 
and consequence of dread  that i committed
the daring counsel which i had to doubt 
and did entreat your highness to this course
which you are running here 


king henry viii

i then moved you 
my lord of canterbury  and got your leave
to make this present summons  unsolicited
i left no reverend person in this court 
but by particular consent proceeded
under your hands and seals  therefore  go on 
for no dislike i  the world against the person
of the good queen  but the sharp thorny points
of my alleged reasons  drive this forward 
prove but our marriage lawful  by my life
and kingly dignity  we are contented
to wear our mortal state to come with her 
katharine our queen  before the primest creature
that paragon o  the world 


cardinal campeius

so please your highness 
the queen being absent   a needful fitness
that we adjourn this court till further day 
meanwhile must be an earnest motion
made to the queen  to call back her appeal
she intends unto his holiness 


king henry viii

 aside 	i may perceive
these cardinals trifle with me  i abhor
this dilatory sloth and tricks of rome 
my learn and well beloved servant  cranmer 
prithee  return  with thy approach  i know 
my comfort comes along  break up the court 
i say  set on 
exeunt in manner as they entered
