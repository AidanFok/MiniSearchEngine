if you will now unite in your complaints 
and force them with a constancy  the cardinal
cannot stand under them  if you omit
the offer of this time  i cannot promise
but that you shall sustain moe new disgraces 
with these you bear already 


surrey

to meet the least occasion that may give me
remembrance of my father in law  the duke 
to be revenged on him

have uncontemn gone by him  or at least
strangely neglected  when did he regard
the stamp of nobleness in any person
out of himself

what he deserves of you and me i know 
what we can do to him  though now the time
gives way to us  i much fear  if you cannot
bar his access to the king  never attempt
any thing on him  for he hath a witchcraft
over the king in tongue 


norfolk

o  fear him not 
his spell in that is out  the king hath found
matter against him that for ever mars
the honey of his language  no  he settled 
not to come off  in his displeasure

and came to the eye o  the king  wherein was read 
how that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
to stay the judgment o  the divorce  for if
it did take place   do  quoth he   
my king is tangled in affection to
a creature of the queen s  lady anne bullen

sharp enough 
lord  for thy justice 


cardinal wolsey

 aside   the late queen gentlewoman 
a knight daughter 
to be her mistress  mistress  the queen queen 
this candle burns not clear   i must snuff it 
then out it goes  what though i know her virtuous
and well deserving  yet i know her for
a spleeny lutheran  and not wholesome to
our cause  that she should lie i  the bosom of
our hard ruled king  again  there is sprung up
an heretic  an arch one  cranmer  one
hath crawl into the favour of the king 
and is his oracle 


norfolk

                  he is vex at something 


surrey

i would  something that would fret the string 
the master cord on heart 
enter king henry viii  reading of a schedule  and lovell


suffolk

the king  the king 


king henry viii

what piles of wealth hath he accumulated
to his own portion  and what expense by the hour
seems to flow from him  how  i  the name of thrift 
does he rake this together  now  my lords 
saw you the cardinal 


norfolk

my lord  we have
stood here observing him  some strange commotion
is in his brain  he bites his lip  and starts 
stops on a sudden  looks upon the ground 
then lays his finger on his temple  straight
springs out into fast gait  then stops again 
strikes his breast hard  and anon he casts
his eye against the moon  in most strange postures
we have seen him set himself 


king henry viii

it may well be 
there is a mutiny in mind  this morning
papers of state he sent me to peruse 
as i required  and wot you what i found
there on my conscience  put unwittingly 
forsooth  an inventory  thus importing 
the several parcels of his plate  his treasure 
rich stuffs  and ornaments of household  which
i find at such proud rate  that it out speaks
possession of a subject 


norfolk

it heaven will 
some spirit put this paper in the packet 
to bless your eye withal 


king henry viii

if we did think
his contemplation were above the earth 
and fix on spiritual object  he should still
dwell in his musings  but i am afraid
his thinkings are below the moon  not worth
his serious considering 
king henry viii takes his seat  whispers lovell  who goes to cardinal wolsey


cardinal wolsey

heaven forgive me 
ever god bless your highness 


king henry viii

good my lord 
you are full of heavenly stuff  and bear the inventory
of your best graces in your mind  the which
you were now running o er  you have scarce time
to steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
to keep your earthly audit  sure  in that
i deem you an ill husband  and am glad
to have you therein my companion 


cardinal wolsey

sir 
for holy offices i have a time  a time
to think upon the part of business which
i bear i  the state  and nature does require
her times of preservation  which perforce
i  her frail son  amongst my brethren mortal 
must give my tendence to 


king henry viii

you have said well 


cardinal wolsey

and ever may your highness yoke together 
as i will lend you cause  my doing well
with my well saying 


king henry viii

 well said again 
and  a kind of good deed to say well 
and yet words are no deeds  my father loved you 
his said he did  and with his deed did crown
his word upon you  since i had my office 
i have kept you next my heart  have not alone
employ you where high profits might come home 
but pared my present havings  to bestow
my bounties upon you 


cardinal wolsey

 aside              what should this mean 


surrey

 aside   the lord increase this business 


king henry viii

have i not made you 
the prime man of the state  i pray you  tell me 
if what i now pronounce you have found true 
and  if you may confess it  say withal 
if you are bound to us or no  what say you 


cardinal wolsey

my sovereign  i confess your royal graces 
shower on me daily  have been more than could
my studied purposes requite  which went
beyond all man endeavours  my endeavours
have ever come too short of my desires 
yet filed with my abilities  mine own ends
have been mine so that evermore they pointed
to the good of your most sacred person and
the profit of the state  for your great graces
heap upon me  poor undeserver  i
can nothing render but allegiant thanks 
my prayers to heaven for you  my loyalty 
which ever has and ever shall be growing 
till death  that winter  kill it 


king henry viii

fairly answer d 
a loyal and obedient subject is
therein illustrated  the honour of it
does pay the act of it  as  i  the contrary 
the foulness is the punishment  i presume
that  as my hand has open bounty to you 
my heart dropp love  my power rain honour  more
on you than any  so your hand and heart 
your brain  and every function of your power 
should  notwithstanding that your bond of duty 
as  in love particular  be more
to me  your friend  than any 


cardinal wolsey

i do profess
that for your highness  good i ever labour 
more than mine own  that am  have  and will be 
though all the world should crack their duty to you 
and throw it from their soul  though perils did
abound  as thick as thought could make  em  and
appear in forms more horrid yet my duty 
as doth a rock against the chiding flood 
should the approach of this wild river break 
and stand unshaken yours 


king henry viii

 nobly spoken 
take notice  lords  he has a loyal breast 
for you have seen him open t  read o this 
giving him papers
and after  this  and then to breakfast with
what appetite you have 
exit king henry viii  frowning upon cardinal wolsey  the nobles throng after him  smiling and whispering


cardinal wolsey

what should this mean 
what sudden anger this  how have i reap it 
he parted frowning from me  as if ruin
leap from his eyes  so looks the chafed lion
upon the daring huntsman that has gall him 
then makes him nothing  i must read this paper 
i fear  the story of his anger   so 
this paper has undone me   the account
of all that world of wealth i have drawn together
for mine own ends  indeed  to gain the popedom 
and fee my friends in rome  o negligence 
fit for a fool to fall by  what cross devil
made me put this main secret in the packet
i sent the king  is there no way to cure this 
no new device to beat this from his brains 
i know  stir him strongly  yet i know
a way  if it take right  in spite of fortune
will bring me off again  what this   the pope 
the letter  as i live  with all the business
i writ to holiness  nay then  farewell 
i have touch the highest point of all my greatness 
and  from that full meridian of my glory 
i haste now to my setting  i shall fall
like a bright exhalation m the evening 
and no man see me more 
re enter to cardinal wolsey  norfolk and suffolk  surrey  and the chamberlain


norfolk

hear the king pleasure  cardinal  who commands you
to render up the great seal presently
into our hands  and to confine yourself
to asher house  my lord of winchester s 
till you hear further from his highness 


cardinal wolsey

stay 
where your commission  lords  words cannot carry
authority so weighty 


suffolk

who dare cross  em 
bearing the king will from his mouth expressly 


cardinal wolsey

till i find more than will or words to do it 
i mean your malice  know  officious lords 
i dare and must deny it  now i feel
of what coarse metal ye are moulded  envy 
how eagerly ye follow my disgraces 
as if it fed ye  and how sleek and wanton
ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin 
follow your envious courses  men of malice 
you have christian warrant for  em  and  no doubt 
in time will find their fit rewards  that seal 
you ask with such a violence  the king 
mine and your master  with his own hand gave me 
bade me enjoy it  with the place and honours 
during my life  and  to confirm his goodness 
tied it by letters patents  now  who take it 


surrey

the king  that gave it 


cardinal wolsey

it must be himself  then 


surrey

thou art a proud traitor  priest 


cardinal wolsey

proud lord  thou liest 
within these forty hours surrey durst better
have burnt that tongue than said so 


surrey

thy ambition 
thou scarlet sin  robb this bewailing land
of noble buckingham  my father in law 
the heads of all thy brother cardinals 
with thee and all thy best parts bound together 
weigh not a hair of his  plague of your policy 
you sent me deputy for ireland 
far from his succor  from the king  from all
that might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him 
whilst your great goodness  out of holy pity 
absolved him with an axe 


cardinal wolsey

this  and all else
this talking lord can lay upon my credit 
i answer is most false  the duke by law
found his deserts  how innocent i was
from any private malice in his end 
his noble jury and foul cause can witness 
if i loved many words  lord  i should tell you
you have as little honesty as honour 
that in the way of loyalty and truth
toward the king  my ever royal master 
dare mate a sounder man than surrey can be 
and all that love his follies 


surrey

by my soul 
your long coat  priest  protects you  thou
shouldst feel
my sword i  the life blood of thee else  my lords 
can ye endure to hear this arrogance 
and from this fellow  if we live thus tamely 
to be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet 
farewell nobility  let his grace go forward 
and dare us with his cap like larks 


cardinal wolsey

all goodness
is poison to thy stomach 


surrey

yes  that goodness
of gleaning all the land wealth into one 
into your own hands  cardinal  by extortion 
the goodness of your intercepted packets
you writ to the pope against the king  your goodness 
since you provoke me  shall be most notorious 
my lord of norfolk  as you are truly noble 
as you respect the common good  the state
of our despised nobility  our issues 
who  if he live  will scarce be gentlemen 
produce the grand sum of his sins  the articles
collected from his life  i startle you
worse than the scaring bell  when the brown wench
lay kissing in your arms  lord cardinal 


cardinal wolsey

how much  methinks  i could despise this man 
but that i am bound in charity against it 


norfolk

those articles  my lord  are in the king hand 
but  thus much  they are foul ones 


cardinal wolsey

so much fairer
and spotless shall mine innocence arise 
when the king knows my truth 


surrey

this cannot save you 
i thank my memory  i yet remember
some of these articles  and out they shall 
now  if you can blush and cry  guilty  cardinal 
you show a little honesty 


cardinal wolsey

speak on  sir 
i dare your worst objections  if i blush 
it is to see a nobleman want manners 


surrey

i had rather want those than my head  have at you 
first  that  without the king assent or knowledge 
you wrought to be a legate  by which power
you maim the jurisdiction of all bishops 


norfolk

then  that in all you writ to rome  or else
to foreign princes   et rex meus 
was still inscribed  in which you brought the king
to be your servant 


suffolk

then that  without the knowledge
either of king or council  when you went
ambassador to the emperor  you made bold
to carry into flanders the great seal 


surrey

item  you sent a large commission
to gregory de cassado  to conclude 
without the king will or the state allowance 
a league between his highness and ferrara 


suffolk

that  out of mere ambition  you have caused
your holy hat to be stamp on the king coin 


surrey

then that you have sent innumerable substance 
by what means got  i leave to your own conscience 
to furnish rome  and to prepare the ways
you have for dignities  to the mere undoing
of all the kingdom  many more there are 
which  since they are of you  and odious 
i will not taint my mouth with 


chamberlain

o my lord 
press not a falling man too far   virtue 
his faults lie open to the laws  let them 
not you  correct him  my heart weeps to see him
so little of his great self 


surrey

i forgive him 


suffolk

lord cardinal  the king further pleasure is 
because all those things you have done of late 
by your power legatine  within this kingdom 
fall into the compass of a praemunire 
that therefore such a writ be sued against you 
to forfeit all your goods  lands  tenements 
chattels  and whatsoever  and to be
out of the king protection  this is my charge 


norfolk

and so we leave you to your meditations
how to live better  for your stubborn answer
about the giving back the great seal to us 
the king shall know it  and  no doubt  shall thank you 
so fare you well  my little good lord cardinal 
exeunt all but cardinal wolsey


cardinal wolsey

so farewell to the little good you bear me 
farewell  a long farewell  to all my greatness 
this is the state of man  to day he puts forth
the tender leaves of hopes  to morrow blossoms 
and bears his blushing honours thick upon him 
the third day comes a frost  a killing frost 
and  when he thinks  good easy man  full surely
his greatness is a ripening  nips his root 
and then he falls  as i do  i have ventured 
like little wanton boys that swim on bladders 
this many summers in a sea of glory 
but far beyond my depth  my high blown pride
at length broke under me and now has left me 
weary and old with service  to the mercy
of a rude stream  that must for ever hide me 
vain pomp and glory of this world  i hate ye 
i feel my heart new open d  o  how wretched
is that poor man that hangs on princes  favours 
there is  betwixt that smile we would aspire to 
that sweet aspect of princes  and their ruin 
more pangs and fears than wars or women have 
and when he falls  he falls like lucifer 
never to hope again 
enter cromwell  and stands amazed
why  how now  cromwell 


cromwell

i have no power to speak  sir 


cardinal wolsey

what  amazed
at my misfortunes  can thy spirit wonder
a great man should decline  nay  an you weep 
i am fall indeed 


cromwell

how does your grace 


cardinal wolsey

why  well 
never so truly happy  my good cromwell 
i know myself now  and i feel within me
a peace above all earthly dignities 
a still and quiet conscience  the king has cured me 
i humbly thank his grace  and from these shoulders 
these ruin pillars  out of pity  taken
a load would sink a navy  too much honour 
o   a burthen  cromwell   a burthen
too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven 


cromwell

i am glad your grace has made that right use of it 


cardinal wolsey

i hope i have  i am able now  methinks 
out of a fortitude of soul i feel 
to endure more miseries and greater far
than my weak hearted enemies dare offer 
what news abroad 


cromwell

                  the heaviest and the worst
is your displeasure with the king 


cardinal wolsey

god bless him 


cromwell

the next is  that sir thomas more is chosen
lord chancellor in your place 


cardinal wolsey

that somewhat sudden 
but he a learned man  may he continue
long in his highness  favour  and do justice
for truth sake and his conscience  that his bones 
when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings 
may have a tomb of orphans  tears wept on em  what more 


cromwell

that cranmer is return with welcome 
install lord archbishop of canterbury 


cardinal wolsey

that news indeed 


cromwell

last  that the lady anne 
whom the king hath in secrecy long married 
this day was view in open as his queen 
going to chapel  and the voice is now
only about her coronation 


cardinal wolsey

there was the weight that pull me down  o cromwell 
the king has gone beyond me  all my glories
in that one woman i have lost for ever 
no sun shall ever usher forth mine honours 
or gild again the noble troops that waited
upon my smiles  go  get thee from me  cromwell 
i am a poor fall man  unworthy now
to be thy lord and master  seek the king 
that sun  i pray  may never set  i have told him
what and how true thou art  he will advance thee 
some little memory of me will stir him 
i know his noble nature not to let
thy hopeful service perish too  good cromwell 
neglect him not  make use now  and provide
for thine own future safety 


cromwell

o my lord 
must i  then  leave you  must i needs forego
so good  so noble and so true a master 
bear witness  all that have not hearts of iron 
with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord 
the king shall have my service  but my prayers
for ever and for ever shall be yours 


cardinal wolsey

cromwell  i did not think to shed a tear
in all my miseries  but thou hast forced me 
out of thy honest truth  to play the woman 
let dry our eyes  and thus far hear me  cromwell 
and  when i am forgotten  as i shall be 
and sleep in dull cold marble  where no mention
of me more must be heard of  say  i taught thee 
say  wolsey  that once trod the ways of glory 
and sounded all the depths and shoals of honour 
found thee a way  out of his wreck  to rise in 
a sure and safe one  though thy master miss it 
mark but my fall  and that that ruin me 
cromwell  i charge thee  fling away ambition 
by that sin fell the angels  how can man  then 
the image of his maker  hope to win by it 
love thyself last  cherish those hearts that hate thee 
corruption wins not more than honesty 
still in thy right hand carry gentle peace 
to silence envious tongues  be just  and fear not 
let all the ends thou aim at be thy country s 
thy god s  and truth s  then if thou fall st 
o cromwell 
thou fall a blessed martyr  serve the king 
and prithee  lead me in 
there take an inventory of all i have 
to the last penny   the king s  my robe 
and my integrity to heaven  is all
i dare now call mine own  o cromwell  cromwell 
had i but served my god with half the zeal
i served my king  he would not in mine age
have left me naked to mine enemies 


cromwell

good sir  have patience 


cardinal wolsey

so i have  farewell
the hopes of court  my hopes in heaven do dwell 
exeunt
