and more and richer  when he strains that lady 
i cannot blame his conscience 


first gentleman

they that bear
the cloth of honour over her  are four barons
of the cinque ports 


second gentleman

those men are happy  and so are all are near her 
i take it  she that carries up the train
is that old noble lady  duchess of norfolk 


first gentleman

second gentleman

their coronets say so  these are stars indeed 
and sometimes falling ones 


first gentleman

no more of that 
exit procession  and then a great flourish of trumpets
enter a third gentleman


first gentleman

god save you  sir  where have you been broiling 


third gentleman

among the crowd i  the abbey  where a finger
could not be wedged in more  i am stifled
with the mere rankness of their joy 


second gentleman

you saw
the ceremony 


third gentleman

                  that i did 


first gentleman

how was it 


third gentleman

well worth the seeing 


second gentleman

good sir  speak it to us 


third gentleman

as well as i am able  the rich stream
of lords and ladies  having brought the queen
to a prepared place in the choir  fell off
a distance from her  while her grace sat down
to rest awhile  some half an hour or so 
in a rich chair of state  opposing freely
the beauty of her person to the people 
believe me  sir  she is the goodliest woman
that ever lay by man  which when the people
had the full view of  such a noise arose
as the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest 
as loud  and to as many tunes  hats  cloaks 
doublets  i think flew up  and had their faces
been loose  this day they had been lost  such joy
i never saw before  great bellied women 
that had not half a week to go  like rams
in the old time of war  would shake the press 
and make  reel before  em  no man living
could say  is my wife  there  all were woven
so strangely in one piece 


second gentleman

but  what follow d 


third gentleman

at length her grace rose  and with modest paces
came to the altar  where she kneel d  and saint like
cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray devoutly 
then rose again and bow her to the people 
when by the archbishop of canterbury
she had all the royal makings of a queen 
as holy oil  edward confessor crown 
the rod  and bird of peace  and all such emblems
laid nobly on her  which perform d  the choir 
with all the choicest music of the kingdom 
together sung  deum  so she parted 
and with the same full state paced back again
to york place  where the feast is held 


first gentleman

sir 
you must no more call it york place  that past 
for  since the cardinal fell  that title lost 
 now the king s  and call whitehall 


third gentleman

i know it 
but  so lately alter d  that the old name
is fresh about me 


second gentleman

                  what two reverend bishops
were those that went on each side of the queen 


third gentleman

stokesly and gardiner  the one of winchester 
newly preferr from the king secretary 
the other  london 


second gentleman

                  he of winchester
is held no great good lover of the archbishop s 
the virtuous cranmer 


third gentleman

all the land knows that 
however  yet there is no great breach  when it comes 
cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him 


second gentleman

who may that be  i pray you 


third gentleman

thomas cromwell 
a man in much esteem with the king  and truly
a worthy friend  the king has made him master
o  the jewel house 
and one  already  of the privy council 


second gentleman

he will deserve more 


third gentleman

yes  without all doubt 
come  gentlemen  ye shall go my way  which
is to the court  and there ye shall be my guests 
something i can command  as i walk thither 
i tell ye more 


both
