alarum  excursions  enter talbot led by a servant


talbot

where is my other life  mine own is gone 
o  where young talbot  where is valiant john 
triumphant death  smear with captivity 
young talbot valour makes me smile at thee 
when he perceived me shrink and on my knee 
his bloody sword he brandish over me 
and  like a hungry lion  did commence
rough deeds of rage and stern impatience 
but when my angry guardant stood alone 
tendering my ruin and assail of none 
dizzy eyed fury and great rage of heart
suddenly made him from my side to start
into the clustering battle of the french 
and in that sea of blood my boy did drench
his over mounting spirit  and there died 
my icarus  my blossom  in his pride 


servant

o  my dear lord  lo  where your son is borne 
enter soldiers  with the body of john talbot


talbot

thou antic death  which laugh us here to scorn 
anon  from thy insulting tyranny 
coupled in bonds of perpetuity 
two talbots  winged through the lither sky 
in thy despite shall  mortality 
o  thou  whose wounds become hard favour death 
speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath 
brave death by speaking  whether he will or no 
imagine him a frenchman and thy foe 
poor boy  he smiles  methinks  as who should say 
had death been french  then death had died to day 
come  come and lay him in his father arms 
my spirit can no longer bear these harms 
soldiers  adieu  i have what i would have 
now my old arms are young john talbot grave 
dies
enter charles  alencon  burgundy  bastard of orleans  joan la pucelle  and forces


charles

had york and somerset brought rescue in 
we should have found a bloody day of this 


bastard of orleans

how the young whelp of talbot s  raging wood 
did flesh his puny sword in frenchmen blood 


joan la pucelle

once i encounter him  and thus i said 
 maiden youth  be vanquish by a maid 
but  with a proud majestical high scorn 
he answer thus   talbot was not born
to be the pillage of a giglot wench 
so  rushing in the bowels of the french 
he left me proudly  as unworthy fight 


burgundy

doubtless he would have made a noble knight 
see  where he lies inhearsed in the arms
of the most bloody nurser of his harms 


bastard of orleans

hew them to pieces  hack their bones asunder
whose life was england glory  gallia wonder 


charles

o  no  forbear  for that which we have fled
during the life  let us not wrong it dead 
enter sir william lucy  attended  herald of the french preceding


lucy

herald  conduct me to the dauphin tent 
to know who hath obtained the glory of the day 


charles

on what submissive message art thou sent 


lucy

submission  dauphin   a mere french word 
we english warriors wot not what it means 
i come to know what prisoners thou hast ta 
and to survey the bodies of the dead 


charles

for prisoners ask thou  hell our prison is 
but tell me whom thou seek st 


lucy

but where the great alcides of the field 
valiant lord talbot  earl of shrewsbury 
created  for his rare success in arms 
great earl of washford  waterford and valence 
lord talbot of goodrig and urchinfield 
lord strange of blackmere  lord verdun of alton 
lord cromwell of wingfield  lord furnival of sheffield 
the thrice victorious lord of falconbridge 
knight of the noble order of saint george 
worthy saint michael and the golden fleece 
great marshal to henry the sixth
of all his wars within the realm of france 


joan la pucelle

here is a silly stately style indeed 
the turk  that two and fifty kingdoms hath 
writes not so tedious a style as this 
him that thou magnifiest with all these titles
stinking and fly blown lies here at our feet 


lucy

is talbot slain  the frenchmen only scourge 
your kingdom terror and black nemesis 
o  were mine eyeballs into bullets turn d 
that i in rage might shoot them at your faces 
o  that i could but call these dead to life 
it were enough to fright the realm of france 
were but his picture left amongst you here 
it would amaze the proudest of you all 
give me their bodies  that i may bear them hence
and give them burial as beseems their worth 


joan la pucelle

i think this upstart is old talbot ghost 
he speaks with such a proud commanding spirit 
for god sake let him have  em  to keep them here 
they would but stink  and putrefy the air 


charles

go  take their bodies hence 


lucy

i bear them hence  but from their ashes shall be rear 
a phoenix that shall make all france afeard 


charles

so we be rid of them  do with  what thou wilt 
and now to paris  in this conquering vein 
all will be ours  now bloody talbot slain
