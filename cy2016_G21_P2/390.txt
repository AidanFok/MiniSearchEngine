enter katharine  dowager  sick  led between griffith  her gentleman usher  and patience  her woman


griffith

how does your grace 


katharine

o griffith  sick to death 
my legs  like loaden branches  bow to the earth 
willing to leave their burthen  reach a chair 
so  now  methinks  i feel a little ease 
didst thou not tell me  griffith  as thou led me 
that the great child of honour  cardinal wolsey  was dead 


griffith

        yes  madam  but i think your grace 
out of the pain you suffer d  gave no ear to t 


katharine

prithee  good griffith  tell me how he died 
if well  he stepp before me  happily
for my example 


griffith

                  well  the voice goes  madam 
for after the stout earl northumberland
arrested him at york  and brought him forward 
as a man sorely tainted  to his answer 
he fell sick suddenly  and grew so ill
he could not sit his mule 


katharine

alas  poor man 


griffith

at last  with easy roads  he came to leicester 
lodged in the abbey  where the reverend abbot 
with all his covent  honourably received him 
to whom he gave these words   o  father abbot 
an old man  broken with the storms of state 
is come to lay his weary bones among ye 
give him a little earth for charity 
so went to bed  where eagerly his sickness
pursued him still  and  three nights after this 
about the hour of eight  which he himself
foretold should be his last  full of repentance 
continual meditations  tears  and sorrows 
he gave his honours to the world again 
his blessed part to heaven  and slept in peace 


katharine

so may he rest  his faults lie gently on him 
yet thus far  griffith  give me leave to speak him 
and yet with charity  he was a man
of an unbounded stomach  ever ranking
himself with princes  one that  by suggestion 
tied all the kingdom  simony was fair play 
his own opinion was his law  i  the presence
he would say untruths  and be ever double
both in his words and meaning  he was never 
but where he meant to ruin  pitiful 
his promises were  as he then was  mighty 
but his performance  as he is now  nothing 
of his own body he was ill  and gave
the clergy in example 


griffith

noble madam 
men evil manners live in brass  their virtues
we write in water  may it please your highness
to hear me speak his good now 


katharine

yes  good griffith 
i were malicious else 


griffith

this cardinal 
though from an humble stock  undoubtedly
was fashion to much honour from his cradle 
he was a scholar  and a ripe and good one 
exceeding wise  fair spoken  and persuading 
lofty and sour to them that loved him not 
but to those men that sought him sweet as summer 
and though he were unsatisfied in getting 
which was a sin  yet in bestowing  madam 
he was most princely  ever witness for him
those twins of learning that he raised in you 
ipswich and oxford  one of which fell with him 
unwilling to outlive the good that did it 
the other  though unfinish d  yet so famous 
so excellent in art  and still so rising 
that christendom shall ever speak his virtue 
his overthrow heap happiness upon him 
for then  and not till then  he felt himself 
and found the blessedness of being little 
and  to add greater honours to his age
than man could give him  he died fearing god 


katharine

after my death i wish no other herald 
no other speaker of my living actions 
to keep mine honour from corruption 
but such an honest chronicler as griffith 
whom i most hated living  thou hast made me 
with thy religious truth and modesty 
now in his ashes honour  peace be with him 
patience  be near me still  and set me lower 
i have not long to trouble thee  good griffith 
cause the musicians play me that sad note
i named my knell  whilst i sit meditating
on that celestial harmony i go to 
sad and solemn music


griffith

she is asleep  good wench  let sit down quiet 
for fear we wake her  softly  gentle patience 
the vision  enter  solemnly tripping one after  another  six personages  clad in white robes   wearing on their heads garlands of bays  and golden  vizards on their faces  branches of bays or palm in  their hands  they first congee unto her  then  dance  and  at certain changes  the first two hold  a spare garland over her head  at which the other  four make reverent curtsies  then the two that held  the garland deliver the same to the other next two   who observe the same order in their changes  and  holding the garland over her head  which done   they deliver the same garland to the last two  who  likewise observe the same order  at which  as it  were by inspiration  she makes in her sleep signs  of rejoicing  and holdeth up her hands to heaven   and so in their dancing vanish  carrying the garland with them  the music continues


katharine

spirits of peace  where are ye  are ye all gone 
and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye 


griffith

madam  we are here 


katharine

it is not you i call for 
saw ye none enter since i slept 


griffith

none  madam 


katharine

no  saw you not  even now  a blessed troop
invite me to a banquet  whose bright faces
cast thousand beams upon me  like the sun 
they promised me eternal happiness 
and brought me garlands  griffith  which i feel
i am not worthy yet to wear  i shall  assuredly 


griffith

i am most joyful  madam  such good dreams
possess your fancy 


katharine

bid the music leave 
they are harsh and heavy to me 
music ceases


patience

do you note
how much her grace is alter on the sudden 
how long her face is drawn  how pale she looks 
and of an earthy cold  mark her eyes 


griffith

she is going  wench  pray  pray 


patience

heaven comfort her 
enter a messenger


messenger

an like your grace 


katharine

you are a saucy fellow 
deserve we no more reverence 


griffith

you are to blame 
knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness 
to use so rude behavior  go to  kneel 


messenger

i humbly do entreat your highness  pardon 
my haste made me unmannerly  there is staying
a gentleman  sent from the king  to see you

who grieves much for your weakness  and by me
sends you his princely commendations 
and heartily entreats you take good comfort 


katharine

o my good lord  that comfort comes too late 
 like a pardon after execution 
that gentle physic  given in time  had cured me 
but now i am past an comforts here  but prayers 
how does his highness 


capucius

katharine

sir  i most humbly pray you to deliver
this to my lord the king 


capucius

most willing  madam 


katharine

in which i have commended to his goodness
the model of our chaste loves  his young daughter 
the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her 
beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding 
she is young  and of a noble modest nature 
i hope she will deserve well and a little
to love her for her mother sake  that loved him 
heaven knows how dearly  my next poor petition
is  that his noble grace would have some pity
upon my wretched women  that so long
have follow both my fortunes faithfully 
of which there is not one  i dare avow 
and now i should not lie  but will deserve
for virtue and true beauty of the soul 
for honesty and decent carriage 
a right good husband  let him be a noble
and  sure  those men are happy that shall have  em 
the last is  for my men  they are the poorest 
but poverty could never draw  from me 
that they may have their wages duly paid  em 
and something over to remember me by 
if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
and able means  we had not parted thus 
these are the whole contents  and  good my lord 
by that you love the dearest in this world 
as you wish christian peace to souls departed 
stand these poor people friend  and urge the king
to do me this last right 


capucius

by heaven  i will 
or let me lose the fashion of a man 


katharine

i thank you  honest lord  remember me
in all humility unto his highness 
say his long trouble now is passing
out of this world  tell him  in death i bless him 
for so i will  mine eyes grow dim  farewell 
my lord  griffith  farewell  nay  patience 
you must not leave me yet  i must to bed 
call in more women  when i am dead  good wench 
let me be used with honour  strew me over
with maiden flowers  that all the world may know
i was a chaste wife to my grave  embalm me 
then lay me forth  although unqueen d  yet like
a queen  and daughter to a king  inter me 
i can no more 
exeunt  leading katharine
