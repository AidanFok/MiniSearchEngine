it seems you are in haste  an if there be
no great offence belongs to t  give your friend
some touch of your late business  affairs  that walk 
as they say spirits do  at midnight  have
in them a wilder nature than the business
that seeks dispatch by day 


lovell

my lord  i love you 
and durst commend a secret to your ear
much weightier than this work  the queen in labour 
they say  in great extremity  and fear 
she with the labour end

i pray for heartily  that it may find
good time  and live  but for the stock  sir thomas 
i wish it grubb up now

deserve our better wishes

is the king hand and tongue  and who dare speak
one syllable against him 


gardiner

there are that dare  and i myself have ventured
to speak my mind of him  and indeed this day 
sir  i may tell it you  i think i have
incensed the lords o  the council  that he is 
for so i know he is  they know he is 
a most arch heretic  a pestilence
that does infect the land  with which they moved
have broken with the king  who hath so far
given ear to our complaint  of his great grace
and princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
our reasons laid before him  hath commanded
to morrow morning to the council board

and we must root him out  from your affairs
i hinder you too long  good night  sir thomas

grievous complaints of you  which  being consider d 
have moved us and our council  that you shall
this morning come before us  where  i know 
you cannot with such freedom purge yourself

which will require your answer  you must take
your patience to you  and be well contented

i should have ta some pains to bring together
yourself and your accusers  and to have heard you 
without indurance  further 


cranmer

most dread liege 
the good i stand on is my truth and honesty 
if they shall fail  i  with mine enemies 
will triumph o my person  which i weigh not 
being of those virtues vacant  i fear nothing
what can be said against me 


king henry viii

know you not
how your state stands i  the world  with the whole world 
your enemies are many  and not small  their practises
must bear the same proportion  and not ever
the justice and the truth o  the question carries
the due o  the verdict with it  at what ease
might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
to swear against you  such things have been done 
you are potently opposed  and with a malice
of as great size  ween you of better luck 
i mean  in perjured witness  than your master 
whose minister you are  whiles here he lived
upon this naughty earth  go to  go to 
you take a precipice for no leap of danger 
and woo your own destruction 


cranmer

protect mine innocence  or i fall into
the trap is laid for me 


king henry viii

be of good cheer 
they shall no more prevail than we give way to 
keep comfort to you  and this morning see
you do appear before them  if they shall chance 
in charging you with matters  to commit you 
the best persuasions to the contrary
fail not to use  and with what vehemency
the occasion shall instruct you  if entreaties
will render you no remedy  this ring
deliver them  and your appeal to us
there make before them  look  the good man weeps
