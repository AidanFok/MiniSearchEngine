 aside 	 butts 
the king physician  as he pass along 
how earnestly he cast his eyes upon me 
pray heaven  he sound not my disgrace  for certain 
this is of purpose laid by some that hate me 
god turn their hearts  i never sought their malice 
to quench mine honour  they would shame to make me
wait else at door  a fellow counsellor 
 boys  grooms  and lackeys  but their pleasures
must be fulfill d  and i attend with patience 
enter the king henry viii and doctor butts at a window above


doctor butts

i show your grace the strangest sight 


king henry viii

doctor butts

i think your highness saw this many a day 


king henry viii

body o  me  where is it 


doctor butts

there  my lord 
the high promotion of his grace of canterbury 
who holds his state at door   pursuivants 
pages  and footboys 


king henry viii

ha   he  indeed 
is this the honour they do one another 
 well there one above  yet  i had thought
they had parted so much honesty among  
at least  good manners  as not thus to suffer
a man of his place  and so near our favour 
to dance attendance on their lordships  pleasures 
and at the door too  like a post with packets 
by holy mary  butts  there knavery 
let  alone  and draw the curtain close 
we shall hear more anon
