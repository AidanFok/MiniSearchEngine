scene iv  the palace yard 


noise and tumult within  enter porter and his man


porter

you leave your noise anon  ye rascals  do you
take the court for paris garden  ye rude slaves 
leave your gaping 
within
good master porter  i belong to the larder 


porter

belong to the gallows  and be hanged  ye rogue  is
this a place to roar in  fetch me a dozen crab tree
staves  and strong ones  these are but switches to
 em  i scratch your heads  you must be seeing
christenings  do you look for ale and cakes here 
you rude rascals 


man

pray  sir  be patient   as much impossible 
unless we sweep  from the door with cannons 
to scatter  em  as  to make  sleep
on may day morning  which will never be 
we may as well push against powle s  as stir em 


porter

how got they in  and be hang d 


man

alas  i know not  how gets the tide in 
as much as one sound cudgel of four foot 
you see the poor remainder could distribute 
i made no spare  sir 


porter

you did nothing  sir 


man

i am not samson  nor sir guy  nor colbrand 
to mow  down before me  but if i spared any
that had a head to hit  either young or old 
he or she  cuckold or cuckold maker 
let me ne hope to see a chine again
and that i would not for a cow  god save her 
within
do you hear  master porter 


porter

i shall be with you presently  good master puppy 
keep the door close  sirrah 


man

what would you have me do 


porter

what should you do  but knock  down by the
dozens  is this moorfields to muster in  or have
we some strange indian with the great tool come to
court  the women so besiege us  bless me  what a
fry of fornication is at door  on my christian
conscience  this one christening will beget a
thousand  here will be father  godfather  and all together 


man

the spoons will be the bigger  sir  there is a
fellow somewhat near the door  he should be a
brazier by his face  for  o  my conscience  twenty
of the dog days now reign in nose  all that stand
about him are under the line  they need no other
penance  that fire drake did i hit three times on
the head  and three times was his nose discharged
against me  he stands there  like a mortar piece  to
blow us  there was a haberdasher wife of small
wit near him  that railed upon me till her pinked
porringer fell off her head  for kindling such a
combustion in the state  i missed the meteor once 
and hit that woman  who cried out  clubs  when i
might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to
her succor  which were the hope o  the strand  where
she was quartered  they fell on  i made good my
place  at length they came to the broom staff to
me  i defied  still  when suddenly a file of
boys behind  em  loose shot  delivered such a shower
of pebbles  that i was fain to draw mine honour in 
and let  win the work  the devil was amongst
 em  i think  surely 


porter

these are the youths that thunder at a playhouse 
and fight for bitten apples  that no audience  but
the tribulation of tower hill  or the limbs of
limehouse  their dear brothers  are able to endure 
i have some of  in limbo patrum  and there they
are like to dance these three days  besides the
running banquet of two beadles that is to come 
enter chamberlain


chamberlain

mercy o  me  what a multitude are here 
they grow still too  from all parts they are coming 
as if we kept a fair here  where are these porters 
these lazy knaves  ye have made a fine hand  fellows 
there a trim rabble let in  are all these
your faithful friends o  the suburbs  we shall have
great store of room  no doubt  left for the ladies 
when they pass back from the christening 


porter

an please
your honour 
we are but men  and what so many may do 
not being torn a pieces  we have done 
an army cannot rule  em 


chamberlain

as i live 
if the king blame me for t  i lay ye all
by the heels  and suddenly  and on your heads
clap round fines for neglect  ye are lazy knaves 
and here ye lie baiting of bombards  when
ye should do service  hark  the trumpets sound 
they come already from the christening 
go  break among the press  and find a way out
to let the troop pass fairly  or i find
a marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months 


porter

make way there for the princess 


man

you great fellow 
stand close up  or i make your head ache 


porter

you i  the camlet  get up o  the rail 
i peck you o the pales else 
exeunt
