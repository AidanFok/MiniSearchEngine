my noble gossips  ye have been too prodigal 
i thank ye heartily  so shall this lady

cranmer

let me speak  sir 
for heaven now bids me  and the words i utter
let none think flattery  for they find  truth 
this royal infant heaven still move about her 
though in her cradle  yet now promises
upon this land a thousand thousand blessings 
which time shall bring to ripeness  she shall be 
but few now living can behold that goodness 
a pattern to all princes living with her 
and all that shall succeed  saba was never
more covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
than this pure soul shall be  all princely graces 
that mould up such a mighty piece as this is 
with all the virtues that attend the good 
shall still be doubled on her  truth shall nurse her 
holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her 
she shall be loved and fear d  her own shall bless her 
her foes shake like a field of beaten corn 
and hang their heads with sorrow  good grows with her 
in her days every man shall eat in safety 
under his own vine  what he plants  and sing
the merry songs of peace to all his neighbours 
god shall be truly known  and those about her
from her shall read the perfect ways of honour 
and by those claim their greatness  not by blood 
nor shall this peace sleep with her  but as when
the bird of wonder dies  the maiden phoenix 
her ashes new create another heir 
as great in admiration as herself 
so shall she leave her blessedness to one 
when heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness 
who from the sacred ashes of her honour
shall star like rise  as great in fame as she was 
and so stand fix d  peace  plenty  love  truth  terror 
that were the servants to this chosen infant 
shall then be his  and like a vine grow to him 
wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine 
his honour and the greatness of his name
shall be  and make new nations  he shall flourish 
and  like a mountain cedar  reach his branches
to all the plains about him  our children children
shall see this  and bless heaven 


king henry viii

thou speakest wonders 


cranmer

she shall be  to the happiness of england 
an aged princess  many days shall see her 
and yet no day without a deed to crown it 
would i had known no more  but she must die 
she must  the saints must have her  yet a virgin 
a most unspotted lily shall she pass
to the ground  and all the world shall mourn her 


king henry viii

o lord archbishop 
thou hast made me now a man  never  before
this happy child  did i get any thing 
this oracle of comfort has so pleased me 
that when i am in heaven i shall desire
to see what this child does  and praise my maker 
i thank ye all  to you  my good lord mayor 
and your good brethren  i am much beholding 
i have received much honour by your presence 
and ye shall find me thankful  lead the way  lords 
ye must all see the queen  and she must thank ye 
she will be sick else  this day  no man think
has business at his house  for all shall stay 
this little one shall make it holiday

epilogue
 ten to one this play can never please
all that are here  some come to take their ease 
and sleep an act or two  but those  we fear 
we have frighted with our trumpets  so   clear 
they say  naught  others  to hear the city
abused extremely  and to cry  that witty 
which we have not done neither  that  i fear 
all the expected good we like to hear
for this play at this time  is only in
the merciful construction of good women 
for such a one we show em  if they smile 
and say  do  i know  within a while
all the best men are ours  for  ill hap 
if they hold when their ladies bid  clap
