chatillon

thus  after greeting  speaks the king of france
in my behavior to the majesty 
the borrow majesty  of england here 


queen elinor

a strange beginning   borrow majesty 


king john

silence  good mother  hear the embassy 


chatillon

philip of france  in right and true behalf
of thy deceased brother geffrey son 
arthur plantagenet  lays most lawful claim
to this fair island and the territories 
to ireland  poictiers  anjou  touraine  maine 
desiring thee to lay aside the sword
which sways usurpingly these several titles 
and put these same into young arthur hand 
thy nephew and right royal sovereign 


king john

what follows if we disallow of this 


chatillon

the proud control of fierce and bloody war 
to enforce these rights so forcibly withheld 


king john

here have we war for war and blood for blood 
controlment for controlment  so answer france 


chatillon

then take my king defiance from my mouth 
the farthest limit of my embassy 


king john

bear mine to him  and so depart in peace 
be thou as lightning in the eyes of france 
for ere thou canst report i will be there 
the thunder of my cannon shall be heard 
so hence  be thou the trumpet of our wrath
and sullen presage of your own decay 
an honourable conduct let him have 
pembroke  look to  t  farewell  chatillon 
exeunt chatillon and pembroke


queen elinor

what now  my son  have i not ever said
how that ambitious constance would not cease
till she had kindled france and all the world 
upon the right and party of her son 
this might have been prevented and made whole
with very easy arguments of love 
which now the manage of two kingdoms must
with fearful bloody issue arbitrate 


king john

our strong possession and our right for us 


queen elinor

your strong possession much more than your right 
or else it must go wrong with you and me 
so much my conscience whispers in your ear 
which none but heaven and you and i shall hear 
enter a sheriff


essex

my liege  here is the strangest controversy
come from country to be judged by you 
that e i heard  shall i produce the men 


king john

let them approach 
our abbeys and our priories shall pay
this expedition charge 
enter robert and the bastard
what men are you 


bastard

your faithful subject i  a gentleman
born in northamptonshire and eldest son 
as i suppose  to robert faulconbridge 
a soldier  by the honour giving hand
of coeur de lion knighted in the field 


king john

what art thou 


robert

the son and heir to that same faulconbridge 


king john

is that the elder  and art thou the heir 
you came not of one mother then  it seems 


bastard

most certain of one mother  mighty king 
that is well known  and  as i think  one father 
but for the certain knowledge of that truth
i put you o to heaven and to my mother 
of that i doubt  as all men children may 


queen elinor

out on thee  rude man  thou dost shame thy mother
and wound her honour with this diffidence 


bastard

i  madam  no  i have no reason for it 
that is my brother plea and none of mine 
the which if he can prove  a  pops me out
at least from fair five hundred pound a year 
heaven guard my mother honour and my land 


king john

a good blunt fellow  why  being younger born 
doth he lay claim to thine inheritance 


bastard

i know not why  except to get the land 
but once he slander me with bastardy 
but whether i be as true begot or no 
that still i lay upon my mother head 
but that i am as well begot  my liege 
fair fall the bones that took the pains for me 
compare our faces and be judge yourself 
if old sir robert did beget us both
and were our father and this son like him 
o old sir robert  father  on my knee
i give heaven thanks i was not like to thee 


king john

why  what a madcap hath heaven lent us here 


queen elinor

he hath a trick of coeur de lion face 
the accent of his tongue affecteth him 
do you not read some tokens of my son
in the large composition of this man 


king john

mine eye hath well examined his parts
and finds them perfect richard  sirrah  speak 
what doth move you to claim your brother land 


bastard

because he hath a half face  like my father 
with half that face would he have all my land 
a half faced groat five hundred pound a year 


robert

my gracious liege  when that my father lived 
your brother did employ my father much 


bastard

well  sir  by this you cannot get my land 
your tale must be how he employ my mother 


robert

and once dispatch him in an embassy
to germany  there with the emperor
to treat of high affairs touching that time 
the advantage of his absence took the king
and in the mean time sojourn at my father s 
where how he did prevail i shame to speak 
but truth is truth  large lengths of seas and shores
between my father and my mother lay 
as i have heard my father speak himself 
when this same lusty gentleman was got 
upon his death bed he by will bequeath 
his lands to me  and took it on his death
that this my mother son was none of his 
and if he were  he came into the world
full fourteen weeks before the course of time 
then  good my liege  let me have what is mine 
my father land  as was my father will 


king john

sirrah  your brother is legitimate 
your father wife did after wedlock bear him 
and if she did play false  the fault was hers 
which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
that marry wives  tell me  how if my brother 
who  as you say  took pains to get this son 
had of your father claim this son for his 
in sooth  good friend  your father might have kept
this calf bred from his cow from all the world 
in sooth he might  then  if he were my brother s 
my brother might not claim him  nor your father 
being none of his  refuse him  this concludes 
my mother son did get your father heir 
your father heir must have your father land 


robert

shall then my father will be of no force
to dispossess that child which is not his 


bastard

of no more force to dispossess me  sir 
than was his will to get me  as i think 


queen elinor

whether hadst thou rather be a faulconbridge
and like thy brother  to enjoy thy land 
or the reputed son of coeur de lion 
lord of thy presence and no land beside 


bastard

madam  an if my brother had my shape 
and i had his  sir robert his  like him 
and if my legs were two such riding rods 
my arms such eel skins stuff d  my face so thin
that in mine ear i durst not stick a rose
lest men should say  look  where three farthings goes 
and  to his shape  were heir to all this land 
would i might never stir from off this place 
i would give it every foot to have this face 
i would not be sir nob in any case 


queen elinor

i like thee well  wilt thou forsake thy fortune 
bequeath thy land to him and follow me 
i am a soldier and now bound to france 


bastard

brother  take you my land  i take my chance 
your face hath got five hundred pound a year 
yet sell your face for five pence and  dear 
madam  i follow you unto the death 


queen elinor

nay  i would have you go before me thither 


bastard

our country manners give our betters way 


king john

what is thy name 


bastard

philip  my liege  so is my name begun 
philip  good old sir robert wife eldest son 


king john

from henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear st 
kneel thou down philip  but rise more great 
arise sir richard and plantagenet 


bastard

brother by the mother side  give me your hand 
my father gave me honour  yours gave land 
now blessed by the hour  by night or day 
when i was got  sir robert was away 


queen elinor

the very spirit of plantagenet 
i am thy grandam  richard  call me so 


bastard

madam  by chance but not by truth  what though 
something about  a little from the right 
in at the window  or else o the hatch 
who dares not stir by day must walk by night 
and have is have  however men do catch 
near or far off  well won is still well shot 
and i am i  howe i was begot 


king john

go  faulconbridge  now hast thou thy desire 
a landless knight makes thee a landed squire 
come  madam  and come  richard  we must speed
for france  for france  for it is more than need 


bastard

brother  adieu  good fortune come to thee 
for thou wast got i  the way of honesty 
exeunt all but bastard
a foot of honour better than i was 
but many a many foot of land the worse 
well  now can i make any joan a lady 
 den  sir richard god a mercy  fellow 
and if his name be george  i call him peter 
for new made honour doth forget men names 
 too respective and too sociable
for your conversion  now your traveller 
he and his toothpick at my worship mess 
and when my knightly stomach is sufficed 
why then i suck my teeth and catechise
my picked man of countries   dear sir 
thus  leaning on mine elbow  i begin 
 shall beseech you that is question now 
and then comes answer like an absey book 
 sir  says answer   your best command 
at your employment  at your service  sir 
 no  sir  says question   i  sweet sir  at yours 
and so  ere answer knows what question would 
saving in dialogue of compliment 
and talking of the alps and apennines 
the pyrenean and the river po 
it draws toward supper in conclusion so 
but this is worshipful society
and fits the mounting spirit like myself 
for he is but a bastard to the time
that doth not smack of observation 
and so am i  whether i smack or no 
and not alone in habit and device 
exterior form  outward accoutrement 
but from the inward motion to deliver
sweet  sweet  sweet poison for the age tooth 
which  though i will not practise to deceive 
yet  to avoid deceit  i mean to learn 
for it shall strew the footsteps of my rising 
but who comes in such haste in riding robes 
what woman post is this  hath she no husband
that will take pains to blow a horn before her 
enter lady faulconbridge and gurney
o me  it is my mother  how now  good lady 
what brings you here to court so hastily 


lady faulconbridge

where is that slave  thy brother  where is he 
that holds in chase mine honour up and down 


bastard

my brother robert  old sir robert son 
colbrand the giant  that same mighty man 
is it sir robert son that you seek so 


lady faulconbridge

sir robert son  ay  thou unreverend boy 
sir robert son  why scorn thou at sir robert 
he is sir robert son  and so art thou 


bastard

james gurney  wilt thou give us leave awhile 


gurney

good leave  good philip 


bastard

philip  sparrow  james 
there toys abroad  anon i tell thee more 
exit gurney
madam  i was not old sir robert son 
sir robert might have eat his part in me
upon good friday and ne broke his fast 
sir robert could do well  marry  to confess 
could he get me  sir robert could not do it 
we know his handiwork  therefore  good mother 
to whom am i beholding for these limbs 
sir robert never holp to make this leg 


lady faulconbridge

hast thou conspired with thy brother too 
that for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour 
what means this scorn  thou most untoward knave 


bastard

knight  knight  good mother  basilisco like 
what  i am dubb d  i have it on my shoulder 
but  mother  i am not sir robert son 
i have disclaim sir robert and my land 
legitimation  name and all is gone 
then  good my mother  let me know my father 
some proper man  i hope  who was it  mother 


lady faulconbridge

hast thou denied thyself a faulconbridge 


bastard

as faithfully as i deny the devil 


lady faulconbridge

king richard coeur de lion was thy father 
by long and vehement suit i was seduced
to make room for him in my husband bed 
heaven lay not my transgression to my charge 
thou art the issue of my dear offence 
which was so strongly urged past my defence 


bastard

now  by this light  were i to get again 
madam  i would not wish a better father 
some sins do bear their privilege on earth 
and so doth yours  your fault was not your folly 
needs must you lay your heart at his dispose 
subjected tribute to commanding love 
against whose fury and unmatched force
the aweless lion could not wage the fight 
nor keep his princely heart from richard hand 
he that perforce robs lions of their hearts
may easily win a woman s  ay  my mother 
with all my heart i thank thee for my father 
who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
when i was got  i send his soul to hell 
come  lady  i will show thee to my kin 
and they shall say  when richard me begot 
if thou hadst said him nay  it had been sin 
who says it was  he lies  i say  not
