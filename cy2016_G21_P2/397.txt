to spread his colours  boy  in thy behalf 
and to rebuke the usurpation
of thy unnatural uncle  english john

arthur

god shall forgive you coeur de lion death
the rather that you give his offspring life 
shadowing their right under your wings of war 
i give you welcome with a powerless hand 
but with a heart full of unstained love 
welcome before the gates of angiers  duke 


lewis

a noble boy  who would not do thee right 


austria

upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss 
as seal to this indenture of my love 
that to my home i will no more return 
till angiers and the right thou hast in france 
together with that pale  that white faced shore 
whose foot spurns back the ocean roaring tides
and coops from other lands her islanders 
even till that england  hedged in with the main 
that water walled bulwark  still secure
and confident from foreign purposes 
even till that utmost corner of the west
salute thee for her king  till then  fair boy 
will i not think of home  but follow arms 


constance

o  take his mother thanks  a widow thanks 
till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
to make a more requital to your love 


austria

the peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
in such a just and charitable war 


king philip

well then  to work  our cannon shall be bent
against the brows of this resisting town 
call for our chiefest men of discipline 
to cull the plots of best advantages 
we lay before this town our royal bones 
wade to the market place in frenchmen blood 
but we will make it subject to this boy 


constance

stay for an answer to your embassy 
lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood 
my lord chatillon may from england bring 
that right in peace which here we urge in war 
and then we shall repent each drop of blood
that hot rash haste so indirectly shed 
enter chatillon


king philip

a wonder  lady  lo  upon thy wish 
our messenger chatillon is arrived 
what england says  say briefly  gentle lord 
we coldly pause for thee  chatillon  speak 


chatillon

then turn your forces from this paltry siege
and stir them up against a mightier task 
england  impatient of your just demands 
hath put himself in arms  the adverse winds 
whose leisure i have stay d  have given him time
to land his legions all as soon as i 
his marches are expedient to this town 
his forces strong  his soldiers confident 
with him along is come the mother queen 
an ate  stirring him to blood and strife 
with her her niece  the lady blanch of spain 
with them a bastard of the king deceased 
and all the unsettled humours of the land 
rash  inconsiderate  fiery voluntaries 
with ladies  faces and fierce dragons  spleens 
have sold their fortunes at their native homes 
bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs 
to make hazard of new fortunes here 
in brief  a braver choice of dauntless spirits
than now the english bottoms have waft o 
did nearer float upon the swelling tide 
to do offence and scath in christendom 
drum beats
the interruption of their churlish drums
cuts off more circumstance  they are at hand 
to parley or to fight  therefore prepare 


king philip

how much unlook for is this expedition 


austria

by how much unexpected  by so much
we must awake endavour for defence 
for courage mounteth with occasion 
let them be welcome then  we are prepared 
enter king john  queen elinor  blanch  the bastard  lords  and forces


king john

peace be to france  if france in peace permit
our just and lineal entrance to our own 
if not  bleed france  and peace ascend to heaven 
whiles we  god wrathful agent  do correct
their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven 


king philip

peace be to england  if that war return
from france to england  there to live in peace 
england we love  and for that england sake
with burden of our armour here we sweat 
this toil of ours should be a work of thine 
but thou from loving england art so far 
that thou hast under wrought his lawful king
cut off the sequence of posterity 
out faced infant state and done a rape
upon the maiden virtue of the crown 
look here upon thy brother geffrey face 
these eyes  these brows  were moulded out of his 
this little abstract doth contain that large
which died in geffrey  and the hand of time
shall draw this brief into as huge a volume 
that geffrey was thy elder brother born 
and this his son  england was geffrey right
and this is geffrey s  in the name of god
how comes it then that thou art call a king 
when living blood doth in these temples beat 
which owe the crown that thou o ermasterest 


king john

from whom hast thou this great commission  france 
to draw my answer from thy articles 


king philip

from that supernal judge  that stirs good thoughts
in any breast of strong authority 
to look into the blots and stains of right 
that judge hath made me guardian to this boy 
under whose warrant i impeach thy wrong
and by whose help i mean to chastise it 


king john

alack  thou dost usurp authority 


king philip

excuse  it is to beat usurping down 


queen elinor

who is it thou dost call usurper  france 


constance

let me make answer  thy usurping son 


queen elinor

out  insolent  thy bastard shall be king 
that thou mayst be a queen  and cheque the world 


constance

my bed was ever to thy son as true
as thine was to thy husband  and this boy
liker in feature to his father geffrey
than thou and john in manners  being as like
as rain to water  or devil to his dam 
my boy a bastard  by my soul  i think
his father never was so true begot 
it cannot be  an if thou wert his mother 


queen elinor

there a good mother  boy  that blots thy father 


constance

whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard 
i smoke your skin coat  an i catch you right 
sirrah  look to t  i  faith  i will  i  faith 


blanch

o  well did he become that lion robe
that did disrobe the lion of that robe 


bastard

it lies as sightly on the back of him
as great alcides  shows upon an ass 
but  ass  i take that burthen from your back 
or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack 


austria

what craker is this same that deafs our ears
with this abundance of superfluous breath 


king philip

lewis  determine what we shall do straight 


lewis

women and fools  break off your conference 
king john  this is the very sum of all 
england and ireland  anjou  touraine  maine 
in right of arthur do i claim of thee 
wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms 


king john

my life as soon  i do defy thee  france 
arthur of bretagne  yield thee to my hand 
and out of my dear love i give thee more
than e the coward hand of france can win 
submit thee  boy

give it a plum  a cherry  and a fig 
there a good grandam 


arthur

good my mother  peace 
i would that i were low laid in my grave 
i am not worth this coil that made for me 


queen elinor

his mother shames him so  poor boy  he weeps 


constance

now shame upon you  whether she does or no 
his grandam wrongs  and not his mother shames 
draws those heaven moving pearls from his poor eyes 
which heaven shall take in nature of a fee 
ay  with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
to do him justice and revenge on you 


queen elinor

thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth 


constance

thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth 
call not me slanderer  thou and thine usurp
the dominations  royalties and rights
of this oppressed boy  this is thy eld son son 
infortunate in nothing but in thee 
thy sins are visited in this poor child 
the canon of the law is laid on him 
being but the second generation
removed from thy sin conceiving womb 


king john

bedlam  have done 


constance

                  i have but this to say 
that he is not only plagued for her sin 
but god hath made her sin and her the plague
on this removed issue  plague for her
and with her plague  her sin his injury 
her injury the beadle to her sin 
all punish in the person of this child 
and all for her  a plague upon her 


queen elinor

thou unadvised scold  i can produce
a will that bars the title of thy son 


constance

ay  who doubts that  a will  a wicked will 
a woman will  a canker grandam will 


king philip

peace  lady  pause  or be more temperate 
it ill beseems this presence to cry aim
to these ill tuned repetitions 
some trumpet summon hither to the walls
these men of angiers  let us hear them speak
whose title they admit  arthur or john s 
trumpet sounds  enter certain citizens upon the walls


first citizen

who is it that hath warn us to the walls 


king philip

 france  for england 


king john

england  for itself 
you men of angiers  and my loving subjects 


king philip

you loving men of angiers  arthur subjects 
our trumpet call you to this gentle parle 


king john

for our advantage  therefore hear us first 
these flags of france  that are advanced here
before the eye and prospect of your town 
have hither march to your endamagement 
the cannons have their bowels full of wrath 
and ready mounted are they to spit forth
their iron indignation  your walls 
all preparation for a bloody siege
all merciless proceeding by these french
confronts your city eyes  your winking gates 
and but for our approach those sleeping stones 
that as a waist doth girdle you about 
by the compulsion of their ordinance
by this time from their fixed beds of lime
had been dishabited  and wide havoc made
for bloody power to rush upon your peace 
but on the sight of us your lawful king 
who painfully with much expedient march
have brought a countercheque before your gates 
to save unscratch your city threatened cheeks 
behold  the french amazed vouchsafe a parle 
and now  instead of bullets wrapp in fire 
to make a shaking fever in your walls 
they shoot but calm words folded up in smoke 
to make a faithless error in your ears 
which trust accordingly  kind citizens 
and let us in  your king  whose labour spirits 
forwearied in this action of swift speed 
crave harbourage within your city walls 


king philip

when i have said  make answer to us both 
lo  in this right hand  whose protection
is most divinely vow upon the right
of him it holds  stands young plantagenet 
son to the elder brother of this man 
and king o him and all that he enjoys 
for this down trodden equity  we tread
in warlike march these greens before your town 
being no further enemy to you
than the constraint of hospitable zeal
in the relief of this oppressed child
religiously provokes  be pleased then
to pay that duty which you truly owe
to that owes it  namely this young prince 
and then our arms  like to a muzzled bear 
save in aspect  hath all offence seal up 
our cannons  malice vainly shall be spent
against the invulnerable clouds of heaven 
and with a blessed and unvex retire 
with unhack swords and helmets all unbruised 
we will bear home that lusty blood again
which here we came to spout against your town 
and leave your children  wives and you in peace 
but if you fondly pass our proffer offer 
 not the roundure of your old faced walls
can hide you from our messengers of war 
though all these english and their discipline
were harbour in their rude circumference 
then tell us  shall your city call us lord 
in that behalf which we have challenged it 
or shall we give the signal to our rage
and stalk in blood to our possession 


first citizen

in brief  we are the king of england subjects 
for him  and in his right  we hold this town 


king john

acknowledge then the king  and let me in 


first citizen

that can we not  but he that proves the king 
to him will we prove loyal  till that time
have we ramm up our gates against the world 


king john

doth not the crown of england prove the king 
and if not that  i bring you witnesses 
twice fifteen thousand hearts of england breed 


bastard

bastards  and else 


king john

to verify our title with their lives 


king philip

as many and as well born bloods as those 


bastard

some bastards too 


king philip

stand in his face to contradict his claim 


first citizen

till you compound whose right is worthiest 
we for the worthiest hold the right from both 


king john

then god forgive the sin of all those souls
that to their everlasting residence 
before the dew of evening fall  shall fleet 
in dreadful trial of our kingdom king 


king philip

amen  amen  mount  chevaliers  to arms 


bastard

saint george  that swinged the dragon  and e since
sits on his horseback at mine hostess  door 
teach us some fence 
to austria
sirrah  were i at home 
at your den  sirrah  with your lioness
i would set an ox head to your lion hide 
and make a monster of you 


austria

peace  no more 


bastard

o tremble  for you hear the lion roar 


king john

up higher to the plain  where we set forth
in best appointment all our regiments 


bastard

speed then  to take advantage of the field 


king philip

it shall be so  and at the other hill
command the rest to stand  god and our right 
exeunt
here after excursions  enter the herald of france  with trumpets  to the gates


french herald

you men of angiers  open wide your gates 
and let young arthur  duke of bretagne  in 
who by the hand of france this day hath made
much work for tears in many an english mother 
whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground 
many a widow husband grovelling lies 
coldly embracing the discolour earth 
and victory  with little loss  doth play
upon the dancing banners of the french 
who are at hand  triumphantly display d 
to enter conquerors and to proclaim
arthur of bretagne england king and yours 
enter english herald  with trumpet


english herald

rejoice  you men of angiers  ring your bells 
king john  your king and england doth approach 
commander of this hot malicious day 
their armours  that march hence so silver bright 
hither return all gilt with frenchmen blood 
there stuck no plume in any english crest
that is removed by a staff of france 
our colours do return in those same hands
that did display them when we first march forth 
and  like a troop of jolly huntsmen  come
our lusty english  all with purpled hands 
dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes 
open your gates and gives the victors way 


first citizen

heralds  from off our towers we might behold 
from first to last  the onset and retire
of both your armies  whose equality
by our best eyes cannot be censured 
blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows 
strength match with strength  and power confronted power 
both are alike  and both alike we like 
one must prove greatest  while they weigh so even 
we hold our town for neither  yet for both 
re enter king john and king philip  with their powers  severally


king john

france  hast thou yet more blood to cast away 
say  shall the current of our right run on 
whose passage  vex with thy impediment 
shall leave his native channel and o 
with course disturb even thy confining shores 
unless thou let his silver water keep
a peaceful progress to the ocean 


king philip

england  thou hast not saved one drop of blood 
in this hot trial  more than we of france 
rather  lost more  and by this hand i swear 
that sways the earth this climate overlooks 
before we will lay down our just borne arms 
we put thee down   whom these arms we bear 
or add a royal number to the dead 
gracing the scroll that tells of this war loss
with slaughter coupled to the name of kings 


bastard

ha  majesty  how high thy glory towers 
when the rich blood of kings is set on fire 
o  now doth death line his dead chaps with steel 
the swords of soldiers are his teeth  his fangs 
and now he feasts  mousing the flesh of men 
in undetermined differences of kings 
why stand these royal fronts amazed thus 
cry   havoc  kings  back to the stained field 
you equal potents  fiery kindled spirits 
then let confusion of one part confirm
the other peace  till then  blows  blood and death 


king john

whose party do the townsmen yet admit 


king philip

speak  citizens  for england  who your king 


first citizen

the king of england  when we know the king 


king philip

know him in us  that here hold up his right 


king john

in us  that are our own great deputy
and bear possession of our person here 
lord of our presence  angiers  and of you 


first citizen

a greater power then we denies all this 
and till it be undoubted  we do lock
our former scruple in our strong barr gates 
king of our fears  until our fears  resolved 
be by some certain king purged and deposed 


bastard

by heaven  these scroyles of angiers flout you  kings 
and stand securely on their battlements 
as in a theatre  whence they gape and point
at your industrious scenes and acts of death 
your royal presences be ruled by me 
do like the mutines of jerusalem 
be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
your sharpest deeds of malice on this town 
by east and west let france and england mount
their battering cannon charged to the mouths 
till their soul fearing clamours have brawl down
the flinty ribs of this contemptuous city 
i play incessantly upon these jades 
even till unfenced desolation
leave them as naked as the vulgar air 
that done  dissever your united strengths 
and part your mingled colours once again 
turn face to face and bloody point to point 
then  in a moment  fortune shall cull forth
out of one side her happy minion 
to whom in favour she shall give the day 
and kiss him with a glorious victory 
how like you this wild counsel  mighty states 
smacks it not something of the policy 


king john

now  by the sky that hangs above our heads 
i like it well  france  shall we knit our powers
and lay this angiers even to the ground 
then after fight who shall be king of it 


bastard

an if thou hast the mettle of a king 
being wronged as we are by this peevish town 
turn thou the mouth of thy artillery 
as we will ours  against these saucy walls 
and when that we have dash them to the ground 
why then defy each other and pell mell
make work upon ourselves  for heaven or hell 


king philip

let it be so  say  where will you assault 


king john

we from the west will send destruction
into this city bosom 


austria

i from the north 


king philip

                  our thunder from the south
shall rain their drift of bullets on this town 


bastard

o prudent discipline  from north to south 
austria and france shoot in each other mouth 
i stir them to it  come  away  away 


first citizen

hear us  great kings  vouchsafe awhile to stay 
and i shall show you peace and fair faced league 
win you this city without stroke or wound 
rescue those breathing lives to die in beds 
that here come sacrifices for the field 
persever not  but hear me  mighty kings 


king john

speak on with favour  we are bent to hear 


first citizen

that daughter there of spain  the lady blanch 
is niece to england  look upon the years
of lewis the dauphin and that lovely maid 
if lusty love should go in quest of beauty 
where should he find it fairer than in blanch 
if zealous love should go in search of virtue 
where should he find it purer than in blanch 
if love ambitious sought a match of birth 
whose veins bound richer blood than lady blanch 
such as she is  in beauty  virtue  birth 
is the young dauphin every way complete 
if not complete of  say he is not she 
and she again wants nothing  to name want 
if want it be not that she is not he 
he is the half part of a blessed man 
left to be finished by such as she 
and she a fair divided excellence 
whose fulness of perfection lies in him 
o  two such silver currents  when they join 
do glorify the banks that bound them in 
and two such shores to two such streams made one 
two such controlling bounds shall you be  kings 
to these two princes  if you marry them 
this union shall do more than battery can
to our fast closed gates  for at this match 
with swifter spleen than powder can enforce 
the mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope 
and give you entrance  but without this match 
the sea enraged is not half so deaf 
lions more confident  mountains and rocks
more free from motion  no  not death himself
in moral fury half so peremptory 
as we to keep this city 


bastard

here a stay
that shakes the rotten carcass of old death
out of his rags  here a large mouth  indeed 
that spits forth death and mountains  rocks and seas 
talks as familiarly of roaring lions
as maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs 
what cannoneer begot this lusty blood 
he speaks plain cannon fire  and smoke and bounce 
he gives the bastinado with his tongue 
our ears are cudgell d  not a word of his
but buffets better than a fist of france 
zounds  i was never so bethump with words
since i first call my brother father dad 


queen elinor

son  list to this conjunction  make this match 
give with our niece a dowry large enough 
for by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
thy now unsured assurance to the crown 
that yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
the bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit 
i see a yielding in the looks of france 
mark  how they whisper  urge them while their souls
are capable of this ambition 
lest zeal  now melted by the windy breath
of soft petitions  pity and remorse 
cool and congeal again to what it was 


first citizen

why answer not the double majesties
this friendly treaty of our threaten town 


king philip

speak england first  that hath been forward first
to speak unto this city  what say you 


king john

if that the dauphin there  thy princely son 
can in this book of beauty read  love 
her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen 
for anjou and fair touraine  maine  poictiers 
and all that we upon this side the sea 
except this city now by us besieged 
find liable to our crown and dignity 
shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
in titles  honours and promotions 
as she in beauty  education  blood 
holds hand with any princess of the world 


king philip

what say thou  boy  look in the lady face 


lewis

i do  my lord  and in her eye i find
a wonder  or a wondrous miracle 
the shadow of myself form in her eye 
which being but the shadow of your son 
becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow 
i do protest i never loved myself
till now infixed i beheld myself
drawn in the flattering table of her eye 
whispers with blanch


bastard

drawn in the flattering table of her eye 
hang in the frowning wrinkle of her brow 
and quarter in her heart  he doth espy
himself love traitor  this is pity now 
that hang and drawn and quartered  there should be
in such a love so vile a lout as he 


blanch

my uncle will in this respect is mine 
if he see aught in you that makes him like 
that any thing he sees  which moves his liking 
i can with ease translate it to my will 
or if you will  to speak more properly 
i will enforce it easily to my love 
further i will not flatter you  my lord 
that all i see in you is worthy love 
than this  that nothing do i see in you 
though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge 
that i can find should merit any hate 


king john

what say these young ones  what say you my niece 


blanch

that she is bound in honour still to do
what you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say 


king john

speak then  prince dauphin  can you love this lady 


lewis

nay  ask me if i can refrain from love 
for i do love her most unfeignedly 


king john

then do i give volquessen  touraine  maine 
poictiers and anjou  these five provinces 
with her to thee  and this addition more 
full thirty thousand marks of english coin 
philip of france  if thou be pleased withal 
command thy son and daughter to join hands 


king philip

it likes us well  young princes  close your hands 


austria

and your lips too  for i am well assured
that i did so when i was first assured 


king philip

now  citizens of angiers  ope your gates 
let in that amity which you have made 
for at saint mary chapel presently
the rites of marriage shall be solemnized 
is not the lady constance in this troop 
i know she is not  for this match made up
her presence would have interrupted much 
where is she and her son  tell me  who knows 


lewis

she is sad and passionate at your highness  tent 


king philip

and  by my faith  this league that we have made
will give her sadness very little cure 
brother of england  how may we content
this widow lady  in her right we came 
which we  god knows  have turn another way 
to our own vantage 


king john

we will heal up all 
for we create young arthur duke of bretagne
and earl of richmond  and this rich fair town
we make him lord of  call the lady constance 
some speedy messenger bid her repair
to our solemnity  i trust we shall 
if not fill up the measure of her will 
yet in some measure satisfy her so
that we shall stop her exclamation 
go we  as well as haste will suffer us 
to this unlook for  unprepared pomp 
exeunt all but the bastard


bastard

mad world  mad kings  mad composition 
john  to stop arthur title in the whole 
hath willingly departed with a part 
and france  whose armour conscience buckled on 
whom zeal and charity brought to the field
as god own soldier  rounded in the ear
with that same purpose changer  that sly devil 
that broker  that still breaks the pate of faith 
that daily break vow  he that wins of all 
of kings  of beggars  old men  young men  maids 
who  having no external thing to lose
but the word  maid  cheats the poor maid of that 
that smooth faced gentleman  tickling commodity 
commodity  the bias of the world 
the world  who of itself is peised well 
made to run even upon even ground 
till this advantage  this vile drawing bias 
this sway of motion  this commodity 
makes it take head from all indifferency 
from all direction  purpose  course  intent 
and this same bias  this commodity 
this bawd  this broker  this all changing word 
clapp on the outward eye of fickle france 
hath drawn him from his own determined aid 
from a resolved and honourable war 
to a most base and vile concluded peace 
and why rail i on this commodity 
but for because he hath not woo me yet 
not that i have the power to clutch my hand 
when his fair angels would salute my palm 
but for my hand  as unattempted yet 
like a poor beggar  raileth on the rich 
well  whiles i am a beggar  i will rail
and say there is no sin but to be rich 
and being rich  my virtue then shall be
to say there is no vice but beggary 
since kings break faith upon commodity 
gain  be my lord  for i will worship thee
