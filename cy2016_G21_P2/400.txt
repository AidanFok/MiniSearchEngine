come hither  little kinsman  hark  a word 


king john

come hither  hubert  o my gentle hubert 
we owe thee much  within this wall of flesh
there is a soul counts thee her creditor
and with advantage means to pay thy love 
and my good friend  thy voluntary oath
lives in this bosom  dearly cherished 
give me thy hand  i had a thing to say 
but i will fit it with some better time 
by heaven  hubert  i am almost ashamed
to say what good respect i have of thee 


hubert

i am much bounden to your majesty 


king john

good friend  thou hast no cause to say so yet 
but thou shalt have  and creep time ne so slow 
yet it shall come from me to do thee good 
i had a thing to say  but let it go 
the sun is in the heaven  and the proud day 
attended with the pleasures of the world 
is all too wanton and too full of gawds
to give me audience  if the midnight bell
did  with his iron tongue and brazen mouth 
sound on into the drowsy race of night 
if this same were a churchyard where we stand 
and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs 
or if that surly spirit  melancholy 
had baked thy blood and made it heavy thick 
which else runs tickling up and down the veins 
making that idiot  laughter  keep men eyes
and strain their cheeks to idle merriment 
a passion hateful to my purposes 
or if that thou couldst see me without eyes 
hear me without thine ears  and make reply
without a tongue  using conceit alone 
without eyes  ears and harmful sound of words 
then  in despite of brooded watchful day 
i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts 
but  ah  i will not  yet i love thee well 
and  by my troth  i think thou lovest me well 


hubert

so well  that what you bid me undertake 
though that my death were adjunct to my act 
by heaven  i would do it 


king john

do not i know thou wouldst 
good hubert  hubert  hubert  throw thine eye
on yon young boy  i tell thee what  my friend 
he is a very serpent in my way 
and whereso this foot of mine doth tread 
he lies before me  dost thou understand me 
thou art his keeper 


hubert

and i keep him so 
that he shall not offend your majesty 


king john

death 


hubert

my lord 


king john

       a grave 


hubert

                  he shall not live 


king john

enough 
i could be merry now  hubert  i love thee 
well  i not say what i intend for thee 
remember  madam  fare you well 
i send those powers o to your majesty 


elinor
