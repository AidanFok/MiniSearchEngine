scene iv  another part of the field 


enter salisbury  pembroke  and bigot


salisbury

i did not think the king so stored with friends 


pembroke

up once again  put spirit in the french 
if they miscarry  we miscarry too 


salisbury

that misbegotten devil  faulconbridge 
in spite of spite  alone upholds the day 


pembroke

they say king john sore sick hath left the field 
enter melun  wounded


melun

lead me to the revolts of england here 


salisbury

when we were happy we had other names 


pembroke

it is the count melun 


salisbury

wounded to death 


melun

fly  noble english  you are bought and sold 
unthread the rude eye of rebellion
and welcome home again discarded faith 
seek out king john and fall before his feet 
for if the french be lords of this loud day 
he means to recompense the pains you take
by cutting off your heads  thus hath he sworn
and i with him  and many moe with me 
upon the altar at saint edmundsbury 
even on that altar where we swore to you
dear amity and everlasting love 


salisbury

may this be possible  may this be true 


melun

have i not hideous death within my view 
retaining but a quantity of life 
which bleeds away  even as a form of wax
resolveth from his figure  the fire 
what in the world should make me now deceive 
since i must lose the use of all deceit 
why should i then be false  since it is true
that i must die here and live hence by truth 
i say again  if lewis do win the day 
he is forsworn  if e those eyes of yours
behold another day break in the east 
but even this night  whose black contagious breath
already smokes about the burning crest
of the old  feeble and day wearied sun 
even this ill night  your breathing shall expire 
paying the fine of rated treachery
even with a treacherous fine of all your lives 
if lewis by your assistance win the day 
commend me to one hubert with your king 
the love of him  and this respect besides 
for that my grandsire was an englishman 
awakes my conscience to confess all this 
in lieu whereof  i pray you  bear me hence
from forth the noise and rumour of the field 
where i may think the remnant of my thoughts
in peace  and part this body and my soul
with contemplation and devout desires 


salisbury

we do believe thee  and beshrew my soul
but i do love the favour and the form
of this most fair occasion  by the which
we will untread the steps of damned flight 
and like a bated and retired flood 
leaving our rankness and irregular course 
stoop low within those bounds we have o erlook 
and cabby run on in obedience
even to our ocean  to our great king john 
my arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence 
for i do see the cruel pangs of death
right in thine eye  away  my friends  new flight 
and happy newness  that intends old right 
exeunt  leading off melun
