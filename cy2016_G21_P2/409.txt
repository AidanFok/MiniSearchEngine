the sun of heaven methought was loath to set 
but stay and made the western welkin blush 
when english measure backward their own ground
in faint retire  o  bravely came we off 
when with a volley of our needless shot 
after such bloody toil  we bid good night 
and wound our tattering colours clearly up 
last in the field  and almost lords of it 
enter a messenger


messenger

where is my prince  the dauphin 


lewis

here  what news 


messenger

the count melun is slain  the english lords
by his persuasion are again fall off 
and your supply  which you have wish so long 
are cast away and sunk on goodwin sands 


lewis

ah  foul shrewd news  beshrew thy very heart 
i did not think to be so sad to night
as this hath made me  who was he that said
king john did fly an hour or two before
the stumbling night did part our weary powers 


messenger

whoever spoke it  it is true  my lord 


lewis

well  keep good quarter and good care to night 
the day shall not be up so soon as i 
to try the fair adventure of to morrow
