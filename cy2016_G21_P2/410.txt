hubert

of the part of england 


bastard

whither dost thou go 


hubert

what that to thee  why may not i demand
of thine affairs  as well as thou of mine 


bastard

hubert  i think 


hubert

                  thou hast a perfect thought 
i will upon all hazards well believe
thou art my friend  that know my tongue so well 
who art thou 


bastard

                  who thou wilt  and if thou please 
thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
i come one way of the plantagenets 


hubert

unkind remembrance  thou and eyeless night
have done me shame  brave soldier  pardon me 
that any accent breaking from thy tongue
should  the true acquaintance of mine ear 


bastard

come  come  sans compliment  what news abroad 


hubert

why  here walk i in the black brow of night 
to find you out 


bastard

                  brief  then  and what the news 


hubert

o  my sweet sir  news fitting to the night 
black  fearful  comfortless and horrible 


bastard

show me the very wound of this ill news 
i am no woman  i not swoon at it 


hubert

the king  i fear  is poison by a monk 
i left him almost speechless  and broke out
to acquaint you with this evil  that you might
the better arm you to the sudden time 
than if you had at leisure known of this 


bastard

how did he take it  who did taste to him 


hubert

a monk  i tell you  a resolved villain 
whose bowels suddenly burst out  the king
yet speaks and peradventure may recover 


bastard

who didst thou leave to tend his majesty 


hubert

why  know you not  the lords are all come back 
and brought prince henry in their company 
at whose request the king hath pardon them 
and they are all about his majesty 


bastard

withhold thine indignation  mighty heaven 
and tempt us not to bear above our power 
i tell tree  hubert  half my power this night 
passing these flats  are taken by the tide 
these lincoln washes have devoured them 
myself  well mounted  hardly have escaped 
away before  conduct me to the king 
i doubt he will be dead or ere i come
