scene i  rome  a street 


enter flavius  marullus  and certain commoners


flavius

hence  home  you idle creatures get you home 
is this a holiday  what  know you not 
being mechanical  you ought not walk
upon a labouring day without the sign
of your profession  speak  what trade art thou 


first commoner

why  sir  a carpenter 


marullus

where is thy leather apron and thy rule 
what dost thou with thy best apparel on 
you  sir  what trade are you 


second commoner

truly  sir  in respect of a fine workman  i am but 
as you would say  a cobbler 


marullus

but what trade art thou  answer me directly 


second commoner

a trade  sir  that  i hope  i may use with a safe
conscience  which is  indeed  sir  a mender of bad soles 


marullus

what trade  thou knave  thou naughty knave  what trade 


second commoner

nay  i beseech you  sir  be not out with me  yet 
if you be out  sir  i can mend you 


marullus

what meanest thou by that  mend me  thou saucy fellow 


second commoner

why  sir  cobble you 


flavius

thou art a cobbler  art thou 


second commoner

truly  sir  all that i live by is with the awl  i
meddle with no tradesman matters  nor women 
matters  but with awl  i am  indeed  sir  a surgeon
to old shoes  when they are in great danger  i
recover them  as proper men as ever trod upon
neat leather have gone upon my handiwork 


flavius

but wherefore art not in thy shop today 
why dost thou lead these men about the streets 


second commoner

truly  sir  to wear out their shoes  to get myself
into more work  but  indeed  sir  we make holiday 
to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph 


marullus

wherefore rejoice  what conquest brings he home 
what tributaries follow him to rome 
to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels 
you blocks  you stones  you worse than senseless things 
o you hard hearts  you cruel men of rome 
knew you not pompey  many a time and oft
have you climb up to walls and battlements 
to towers and windows  yea  to chimney tops 
your infants in your arms  and there have sat
the livelong day  with patient expectation 
to see great pompey pass the streets of rome 
and when you saw his chariot but appear 
have you not made an universal shout 
that tiber trembled underneath her banks 
to hear the replication of your sounds
made in her concave shores 
and do you now put on your best attire 
and do you now cull out a holiday 
and do you now strew flowers in his way
that comes in triumph over pompey blood  be gone 
run to your houses  fall upon your knees 
pray to the gods to intermit the plague
that needs must light on this ingratitude 


flavius

go  go  good countrymen  and  for this fault 
assemble all the poor men of your sort 
draw them to tiber banks  and weep your tears
into the channel  till the lowest stream
do kiss the most exalted shores of all 
exeunt all the commoners
see whether their basest metal be not moved 
they vanish tongue tied in their guiltiness 
go you down that way towards the capitol 


this way will i

disrobe the images 
if you do find them deck with ceremonies 


marullus

may we do so 
you know it is the feast of lupercal 


flavius

it is no matter  let no images
be hung with caesar trophies  i about 
and drive away the vulgar from the streets 
so do you too  where you perceive them thick 
these growing feathers pluck from caesar wing
will make him fly an ordinary pitch 
who else would soar above the view of men
and keep us all in servile fearfulness 
exeunt
