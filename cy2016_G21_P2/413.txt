calpurnia

antony

caesar  my lord 


caesar

forget not  in your speed  antonius 
to touch calpurnia  for our elders say 
the barren  touched in this holy chase 
shake off their sterile curse 


antony

i shall remember 
when caesar says  this  it is perform d 


caesar

set on  and leave no ceremony out 
flourish


soothsayer

caesar 


caesar

ha  who calls 


casca

bid every noise be still  peace yet again 


caesar

who is it in the press that calls on me 
i hear a tongue  shriller than all the music 
cry  caesar  speak  caesar is turn to hear 


soothsayer

beware the ides of march 


caesar

what man is that 


brutus

a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march 


caesar

set him before me  let me see his face 


cassius

fellow  come from the throng  look upon caesar 


caesar

what say thou to me now  speak once again 


soothsayer

beware the ides of march 


caesar

he is a dreamer  let us leave him  pass 
sennet  exeunt all except brutus and cassius


cassius

will you go see the order of the course 


brutus

not i 


cassius

i pray you  do 


brutus

i am not gamesome  i do lack some part
of that quick spirit that is in antony 
let me not hinder  cassius  your desires 
i leave you 


cassius

brutus  i do observe you now of late 
i have not from your eyes that gentleness
and show of love as i was wont to have 
you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
over your friend that loves you 


brutus

cassius 
be not deceived  if i have veil my look 
i turn the trouble of my countenance
merely upon myself  vexed i am
of late with passions of some difference 
conceptions only proper to myself 
which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors 
but let not therefore my good friends be grieved 
among which number  cassius  be you one 
nor construe any further my neglect 
than that poor brutus  with himself at war 
forgets the shows of love to other men 


cassius

then  brutus  i have much mistook your passion 
by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
thoughts of great value  worthy cogitations 
tell me  good brutus  can you see your face 


brutus

no  cassius  for the eye sees not itself 
but by reflection  by some other things 


cassius

 just 
and it is very much lamented  brutus 
that you have no such mirrors as will turn
your hidden worthiness into your eye 
that you might see your shadow  i have heard 
where many of the best respect in rome 
except immortal caesar  speaking of brutus
and groaning underneath this age yoke 
have wish that noble brutus had his eyes 


brutus

into what dangers would you lead me  cassius 
that you would have me seek into myself
for that which is not in me 


cassius

therefore  good brutus  be prepared to hear 
and since you know you cannot see yourself
so well as by reflection  i  your glass 
will modestly discover to yourself
that of yourself which you yet know not of 
and be not jealous on me  gentle brutus 
were i a common laugher  or did use
to stale with ordinary oaths my love
to every new protester  if you know
that i do fawn on men and hug them hard
and after scandal them  or if you know
that i profess myself in banqueting
to all the rout  then hold me dangerous 
flourish  and shout


brutus

what means this shouting  i do fear  the people
choose caesar for their king 


cassius

ay  do you fear it 
then must i think you would not have it so 


brutus

i would not  cassius  yet i love him well 
but wherefore do you hold me here so long 
what is it that you would impart to me 
if it be aught toward the general good 
set honour in one eye and death i  the other 
and i will look on both indifferently 
for let the gods so speed me as i love
the name of honour more than i fear death 


cassius

i know that virtue to be in you  brutus 
as well as i do know your outward favour 
well  honour is the subject of my story 
i cannot tell what you and other men
think of this life  but  for my single self 
i had as lief not be as live to be
in awe of such a thing as i myself 
i was born free as caesar  so were you 
we both have fed as well  and we can both
endure the winter cold as well as he 
for once  upon a raw and gusty day 
the troubled tiber chafing with her shores 
caesar said to me  thou  cassius  now
leap in with me into this angry flood 
and swim to yonder point  upon the word 
accoutred as i was  i plunged in
and bade him follow  so indeed he did 
the torrent roar d  and we did buffet it
with lusty sinews  throwing it aside
and stemming it with hearts of controversy 
but ere we could arrive the point proposed 
caesar cried  me  cassius  or i sink 
i  as aeneas  our great ancestor 
did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder
the old anchises bear  so from the waves of tiber
did i the tired caesar  and this man
is now become a god  and cassius is
a wretched creature and must bend his body 
if caesar carelessly but nod on him 
he had a fever when he was in spain 
and when the fit was on him  i did mark
how he did shake   true  this god did shake 
his coward lips did from their colour fly 
and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
did lose his lustre  i did hear him groan 
ay  and that tongue of his that bade the romans
mark him and write his speeches in their books 
alas  it cried  me some drink  titinius 
as a sick girl  ye gods  it doth amaze me
a man of such a feeble temper should
so get the start of the majestic world
and bear the palm alone 
shout  flourish


brutus

another general shout 
i do believe that these applauses are
for some new honours that are heap on caesar 


cassius

why  man  he doth bestride the narrow world
like a colossus  and we petty men
walk under his huge legs and peep about
to find ourselves dishonourable graves 
men at some time are masters of their fates 
the fault  dear brutus  is not in our stars 
but in ourselves  that we are underlings 
brutus and caesar  what should be in that  caesar 
why should that name be sounded more than yours 
write them together  yours is as fair a name 
sound them  it doth become the mouth as well 
weigh them  it is as heavy  conjure with  em 
brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar 
now  in the names of all the gods at once 
upon what meat doth this our caesar feed 
that he is grown so great  age  thou art shamed 
rome  thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods 
when went there by an age  since the great flood 
but it was famed with more than with one man 
when could they say till now  that talk of rome 
that her wide walls encompass but one man 
now is it rome indeed and room enough 
when there is in it but one only man 
o  you and i have heard our fathers say 
there was a brutus once that would have brook 
the eternal devil to keep his state in rome
as easily as a king 


brutus

that you do love me  i am nothing jealous 
what you would work me to  i have some aim 
how i have thought of this and of these times 
i shall recount hereafter  for this present 
i would not  so with love i might entreat you 
be any further moved  what you have said
i will consider  what you have to say
i will with patience hear  and find a time
both meet to hear and answer such high things 
till then  my noble friend  chew upon this 
brutus had rather be a villager
than to repute himself a son of rome
under these hard conditions as this time
is like to lay upon us 


cassius

i am glad that my weak words
have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus 


brutus

the games are done and caesar is returning 


cassius

as they pass by  pluck casca by the sleeve 
and he will  after his sour fashion  tell you
what hath proceeded worthy note to day 
re enter caesar and his train


brutus

i will do so  but  look you  cassius 
the angry spot doth glow on caesar brow 
and all the rest look like a chidden train 
calpurnia cheek is pale  and cicero
looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
as we have seen him in the capitol 
being cross in conference by some senators 


cassius

casca will tell us what the matter is 


caesar

antonius 


antony

caesar 


caesar

let me have men about me that are fat 
sleek headed men and such as sleep o  nights 
yond cassius has a lean and hungry look 
he thinks too much  such men are dangerous 


antony

fear him not  caesar  he not dangerous 
he is a noble roman and well given 


caesar

would he were fatter  but i fear him not 
yet if my name were liable to fear 
i do not know the man i should avoid
so soon as that spare cassius  he reads much 
he is a great observer and he looks
quite through the deeds of men  he loves no plays 
as thou dost  antony  he hears no music 
seldom he smiles  and smiles in such a sort
as if he mock himself and scorn his spirit
that could be moved to smile at any thing 
such men as he be never at heart ease
whiles they behold a greater than themselves 
and therefore are they very dangerous 
i rather tell thee what is to be fear 
than what i fear  for always i am caesar 
come on my right hand  for this ear is deaf 
and tell me truly what thou think of him 
sennet  exeunt caesar and all his train  but casca


casca

you pull me by the cloak  would you speak with me 


brutus

ay  casca  tell us what hath chanced to day 
that caesar looks so sad 


casca

why  you were with him  were you not 


brutus

i should not then ask casca what had chanced 


casca

why  there was a crown offered him  and being
offered him  he put it by with the back of his hand 
thus  and then the people fell a shouting 


brutus

what was the second noise for 


casca

why  for that too 


cassius

they shouted thrice  what was the last cry for 


casca

why  for that too 


brutus

was the crown offered him thrice 


casca

ay  marry  was t  and he put it by thrice  every
time gentler than other  and at every putting by
mine honest neighbours shouted 


cassius

who offered him the crown 


casca

why  antony 


brutus

tell us the manner of it  gentle casca 


casca

i can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it 
it was mere foolery  i did not mark it  i saw mark
antony offer him a crown yet  not a crown
neither   one of these coronets and  as i told
you  he put it by once  but  for all that  to my
thinking  he would fain have had it  then he
offered it to him again  then he put it by again 
but  to my thinking  he was very loath to lay his
fingers off it  and then he offered it the third
time  he put it the third time by  and still as he
refused it  the rabblement hooted and clapped their
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night caps
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
caesar  for he swounded and fell down at it  and
for mine own part  i durst not laugh  for fear of
opening my lips and receiving the bad air 


cassius

but  soft  i pray you  what  did caesar swound 


casca

he fell down in the market place  and foamed at
mouth  and was speechless 


brutus

 very like  he hath the failing sickness 


cassius

no  caesar hath it not  but you and i 
and honest casca  we have the falling sickness 


casca

i know not what you mean by that  but  i am sure 
caesar fell down  if the tag rag people did not
clap him and hiss him  according as he pleased and
displeased them  as they use to do the players in
the theatre  i am no true man 


brutus

what said he when he came unto himself 


casca

marry  before he fell down  when he perceived the
common herd was glad he refused the crown  he
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
throat to cut  an i had been a man of any
occupation  if i would not have taken him at a word 
i would i might go to hell among the rogues  and so
he fell  when he came to himself again  he said 
if he had done or said any thing amiss  he desired
their worships to think it was his infirmity  three
or four wenches  where i stood  cried  alas  good
soul  and forgave him with all their hearts  but
there no heed to be taken of them  if caesar had
stabbed their mothers  they would have done no less 


brutus

and after that  he came  thus sad  away 


casca

ay 


cassius

did cicero say any thing 


casca

ay  he spoke greek 


cassius

to what effect 


casca

nay  an i tell you that  ill ne look you i  the
face again  but those that understood him smiled at
one another and shook their heads  but  for mine own
part  it was greek to me  i could tell you more
news too  marullus and flavius  for pulling scarfs
off caesar images  are put to silence  fare you
well  there was more foolery yet  if i could
remember it 


cassius

will you sup with me to night  casca 


casca

no  i am promised forth 


cassius

will you dine with me to morrow 


casca

ay  if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
worth the eating 


cassius

good  i will expect you 


casca

do so  farewell  both 
exit


brutus

what a blunt fellow is this grown to be 
he was quick mettle when he went to school 


cassius

so is he now in execution
of any bold or noble enterprise 
however he puts on this tardy form 
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit 
which gives men stomach to digest his words
with better appetite 


brutus

and so it is  for this time i will leave you 
to morrow  if you please to speak with me 
i will come home to you  or  if you will 
come home to me  and i will wait for you 


cassius

i will do so  till then  think of the world 
exit brutus
well  brutus  thou art noble  yet  i see 
thy honourable metal may be wrought
from that it is disposed  therefore it is meet
that noble minds keep ever with their likes 
for who so firm that cannot be seduced 
caesar doth bear me hard  but he loves brutus 
if i were brutus now and he were cassius 
he should not humour me  i will this night 
in several hands  in at his windows throw 
as if they came from several citizens 
writings all tending to the great opinion
that rome holds of his name  wherein obscurely
caesar ambition shall be glanced at 
and after this let caesar seat him sure 
for we will shake him  or worse days endure 
exit
