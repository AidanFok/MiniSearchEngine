scene iii  the same  a street 


thunder and lightning  enter from opposite sides  casca  with his sword drawn  and cicero


cicero

good even  casca  brought you caesar home 
why are you breathless  and why stare you so 


casca

are not you moved  when all the sway of earth
shakes like a thing unfirm  o cicero 
i have seen tempests  when the scolding winds
have rived the knotty oaks  and i have seen
the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam 
to be exalted with the threatening clouds 
but never till to night  never till now 
did i go through a tempest dropping fire 
either there is a civil strife in heaven 
or else the world  too saucy with the gods 
incenses them to send destruction 


cicero

why  saw you any thing more wonderful 


casca

a common slave you know him well by sight 
held up his left hand  which did flame and burn
like twenty torches join d  and yet his hand 
not sensible of fire  remain unscorch d 
besides i ha  not since put up my sword 
against the capitol i met a lion 
who glared upon me  and went surly by 
without annoying me  and there were drawn
upon a heap a hundred ghastly women 
transformed with their fear  who swore they saw
men all in fire walk up and down the streets 
and yesterday the bird of night did sit
even at noon day upon the market place 
hooting and shrieking  when these prodigies
do so conjointly meet  let not men say
 are their reasons  they are natural 
for  i believe  they are portentous things
unto the climate that they point upon 


cicero

indeed  it is a strange disposed time 
but men may construe things after their fashion 
clean from the purpose of the things themselves 
come caesar to the capitol to morrow 


casca

he doth  for he did bid antonius
send word to you he would be there to morrow 


cicero

good night then  casca  this disturbed sky
is not to walk in 


casca

farewell  cicero 
exit cicero
enter cassius


cassius

who there 


casca

                  a roman 


cassius

casca  by your voice 


casca

your ear is good  cassius  what night is this 


cassius

a very pleasing night to honest men 


casca

who ever knew the heavens menace so 


cassius

those that have known the earth so full of faults 
for my part  i have walk about the streets 
submitting me unto the perilous night 
and  thus unbraced  casca  as you see 
have bared my bosom to the thunder stone 
and when the cross blue lightning seem to open
the breast of heaven  i did present myself
even in the aim and very flash of it 


casca

but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens 
it is the part of men to fear and tremble 
when the most mighty gods by tokens send
such dreadful heralds to astonish us 


cassius

you are dull  casca  and those sparks of life
that should be in a roman you do want 
or else you use not  you look pale and gaze
and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder 
to see the strange impatience of the heavens 
but if you would consider the true cause
why all these fires  why all these gliding ghosts 
why birds and beasts from quality and kind 
why old men fool and children calculate 
why all these things change from their ordinance
their natures and preformed faculties
to monstrous quality why  you shall find
that heaven hath infused them with these spirits 
to make them instruments of fear and warning
unto some monstrous state 
now could i  casca  name to thee a man
most like this dreadful night 
that thunders  lightens  opens graves  and roars
as doth the lion in the capitol 
a man no mightier than thyself or me
in personal action  yet prodigious grown
and fearful  as these strange eruptions are 


casca

 caesar that you mean  is it not  cassius 


cassius

let it be who it is  for romans now
have thews and limbs like to their ancestors 
but  woe the while  our fathers  minds are dead 
and we are govern with our mothers  spirits 
our yoke and sufferance show us womanish 


casca

indeed  they say the senators tomorrow
mean to establish caesar as a king 
and he shall wear his crown by sea and land 
in every place  save here in italy 


cassius

i know where i will wear this dagger then 
cassius from bondage will deliver cassius 
therein  ye gods  you make the weak most strong 
therein  ye gods  you tyrants do defeat 
nor stony tower  nor walls of beaten brass 
nor airless dungeon  nor strong links of iron 
can be retentive to the strength of spirit 
but life  being weary of these worldly bars 
never lacks power to dismiss itself 
if i know this  know all the world besides 
that part of tyranny that i do bear
i can shake off at pleasure 
thunder still


casca

so can i 
so every bondman in his own hand bears
the power to cancel his captivity 


cassius

and why should caesar be a tyrant then 
poor man  i know he would not be a wolf 
but that he sees the romans are but sheep 
he were no lion  were not romans hinds 
those that with haste will make a mighty fire
begin it with weak straws  what trash is rome 
what rubbish and what offal  when it serves
for the base matter to illuminate
so vile a thing as caesar  but  o grief 
where hast thou led me  i perhaps speak this
before a willing bondman  then i know
my answer must be made  but i am arm d 
and dangers are to me indifferent 


casca

you speak to casca  and to such a man
that is no fleering tell tale  hold  my hand 
be factious for redress of all these griefs 
and i will set this foot of mine as far
as who goes farthest 


cassius

there a bargain made 
now know you  casca  i have moved already
some certain of the noblest minded romans
to undergo with me an enterprise
of honourable dangerous consequence 
and i do know  by this  they stay for me
in pompey porch  for now  this fearful night 
there is no stir or walking in the streets 
and the complexion of the element
in favour like the work we have in hand 
most bloody  fiery  and most terrible 


casca

stand close awhile  for here comes one in haste 


cassius

 cinna  i do know him by his gait 
he is a friend 
enter cinna
cinna  where haste you so 


cinna

to find out you  who that  metellus cimber 


cassius

no  it is casca  one incorporate
to our attempts  am i not stay for  cinna 


cinna

i am glad on  t  what a fearful night is this 
there two or three of us have seen strange sights 


cassius

am i not stay for  tell me 


cinna

yes  you are 
o cassius  if you could
but win the noble brutus to our party 


cassius

be you content  good cinna  take this paper 
and look you lay it in the praetor chair 
where brutus may but find it  and throw this
in at his window  set this up with wax
upon old brutus  statue  all this done 
repair to pompey porch  where you shall find us 
is decius brutus and trebonius there 


cinna

all but metellus cimber  and he gone
to seek you at your house  well  i will hie 
and so bestow these papers as you bade me 


cassius

that done  repair to pompey theatre 
exit cinna
come  casca  you and i will yet ere day
see brutus at his house  three parts of him
is ours already  and the man entire
upon the next encounter yields him ours 


casca

o  he sits high in all the people hearts 
and that which would appear offence in us 
his countenance  like richest alchemy 
will change to virtue and to worthiness 


cassius

him and his worth and our great need of him
you have right well conceited  let us go 
for it is after midnight  and ere day
we will awake him and be sure of him
