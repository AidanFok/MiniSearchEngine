brutus

what  lucius  ho 
i cannot  by the progress of the stars 
give guess how near to day  lucius  i say 
i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly 
when  lucius  when  awake  i say  what  lucius 
enter lucius


lucius

call you  my lord 


brutus

get me a taper in my study  lucius 
when it is lighted  come and call me here 


lucius

i will  my lord 
exit


brutus

it must be by his death  and for my part 
i know no personal cause to spurn at him 
but for the general  he would be crown d 
how that might change his nature  there the question 
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder 
and that craves wary walking  crown him that 
and then  i grant  we put a sting in him 
that at his will he may do danger with 
the abuse of greatness is  when it disjoins
remorse from power  and  to speak truth of caesar 
i have not known when his affections sway 
more than his reason  but  a common proof 
that lowliness is young ambition ladder 
whereto the climber upward turns his face 
but when he once attains the upmost round 
he then unto the ladder turns his back 
looks in the clouds  scorning the base degrees
by which he did ascend  so caesar may 
then  lest he may  prevent  and  since the quarrel
will bear no colour for the thing he is 
fashion it thus  that what he is  augmented 
would run to these and these extremities 
and therefore think him as a serpent egg
which  hatch d  would  as his kind  grow mischievous 
and kill him in the shell 
re enter lucius


lucius

the taper burneth in your closet  sir 
searching the window for a flint  i found
this paper  thus seal up  and  i am sure 
it did not lie there when i went to bed 
gives him the letter


brutus

get you to bed again  it is not day 
is not to morrow  boy  the ides of march 


lucius

i know not  sir 


brutus

look in the calendar  and bring me word 


lucius

i will  sir 
exit


brutus

the exhalations whizzing in the air
give so much light that i may read by them 
opens the letter and reads
 brutus  thou sleep st  awake  and see thyself 
shall rome     c  speak  strike  redress 
brutus  thou sleep st  awake 
such instigations have been often dropp 
where i have took them up 
 rome     c  thus must i piece it out 
shall rome stand under one man awe  what  rome 
my ancestors did from the streets of rome
the tarquin drive  when he was call a king 
 speak  strike  redress  am i entreated
to speak and strike  o rome  i make thee promise 
if the redress will follow  thou receivest
thy full petition at the hand of brutus 
re enter lucius


lucius

sir  march is wasted fourteen days 
knocking within


brutus

 good  go to the gate  somebody knocks 
exit lucius
since cassius first did whet me against caesar 
i have not slept 
between the acting of a dreadful thing
and the first motion  all the interim is
like a phantasma  or a hideous dream 
the genius and the mortal instruments
are then in council  and the state of man 
like to a little kingdom  suffers then
the nature of an insurrection 
re enter lucius


lucius

sir   your brother cassius at the door 
who doth desire to see you 


brutus

is he alone 


lucius

no  sir  there are moe with him 


brutus

do you know them 


lucius

no  sir  their hats are pluck about their ears 
and half their faces buried in their cloaks 
that by no means i may discover them
by any mark of favour 


brutus

let  enter 
exit lucius
they are the faction  o conspiracy 
shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night 
when evils are most free  o  then by day
where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
to mask thy monstrous visage  seek none  conspiracy 
hide it in smiles and affability 
for if thou path  thy native semblance on 
not erebus itself were dim enough
to hide thee from prevention 
enter the conspirators  cassius  casca  decius brutus  cinna  metellus cimber  and trebonius


cassius

i think we are too bold upon your rest 
good morrow  brutus  do we trouble you 


brutus

i have been up this hour  awake all night 
know i these men that come along with you 


cassius

yes  every man of them  and no man here
but honours you  and every one doth wish
you had but that opinion of yourself
which every noble roman bears of you 
this is trebonius 


brutus

                  he is welcome hither 


cassius

this  decius brutus 


brutus

he is welcome too 


cassius

this  casca  this  cinna  and this  metellus cimber 


brutus

they are all welcome 
what watchful cares do interpose themselves
betwixt your eyes and night 


cassius

shall i entreat a word 
brutus and cassius whisper


decius brutus

here lies the east  doth not the day break here 


casca

no 


cinna

o  pardon  sir  it doth  and yon gray lines
that fret the clouds are messengers of day 


casca

you shall confess that you are both deceived 
here  as i point my sword  the sun arises 
which is a great way growing on the south 
weighing the youthful season of the year 
some two months hence up higher toward the north
he first presents his fire  and the high east
stands  as the capitol  directly here 


brutus

give me your hands all over  one by one 


cassius

and let us swear our resolution 


brutus

no  not an oath  if not the face of men 
the sufferance of our souls  the time abuse 
if these be motives weak  break off betimes 
and every man hence to his idle bed 
so let high sighted tyranny range on 
till each man drop by lottery  but if these 
as i am sure they do  bear fire enough
to kindle cowards and to steel with valour
the melting spirits of women  then  countrymen 
what need we any spur but our own cause 
to prick us to redress  what other bond
than secret romans  that have spoke the word 
and will not palter  and what other oath
than honesty to honesty engaged 
that this shall be  or we will fall for it 
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous 
old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
that welcome wrongs  unto bad causes swear
such creatures as men doubt  but do not stain
the even virtue of our enterprise 
nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits 
to think that or our cause or our performance
did need an oath  when every drop of blood
that every roman bears  and nobly bears 
is guilty of a several bastardy 
if he do break the smallest particle
of any promise that hath pass from him 


cassius

but what of cicero  shall we sound him 
i think he will stand very strong with us 


casca

let us not leave him out 


cinna

no  by no means 


metellus cimber

o  let us have him  for his silver hairs
will purchase us a good opinion
and buy men voices to commend our deeds 
it shall be said  his judgment ruled our hands 
our youths and wildness shall no whit appear 
but all be buried in his gravity 


brutus

o  name him not  let us not break with him 
for he will never follow any thing
that other men begin 


cassius

then leave him out 


casca

indeed he is not fit 


decius brutus

shall no man else be touch but only caesar 


cassius

decius  well urged  i think it is not meet 
mark antony  so well beloved of caesar 
should outlive caesar  we shall find of him
a shrewd contriver  and  you know  his means 
if he improve them  may well stretch so far
as to annoy us all  which to prevent 
let antony and caesar fall together 


brutus

our course will seem too bloody  caius cassius 
to cut the head off and then hack the limbs 
like wrath in death and envy afterwards 
for antony is but a limb of caesar 
let us be sacrificers  but not butchers  caius 
we all stand up against the spirit of caesar 
and in the spirit of men there is no blood 
o  that we then could come by caesar spirit 
and not dismember caesar  but  alas 
caesar must bleed for it  and  gentle friends 
let kill him boldly  but not wrathfully 
let carve him as a dish fit for the gods 
not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds 
and let our hearts  as subtle masters do 
stir up their servants to an act of rage 
and after seem to chide  em  this shall make
our purpose necessary and not envious 
which so appearing to the common eyes 
we shall be call purgers  not murderers 
and for mark antony  think not of him 
for he can do no more than caesar arm
when caesar head is off 


cassius

yet i fear him 
for in the ingrafted love he bears to caesar 


brutus

alas  good cassius  do not think of him 
if he love caesar  all that he can do
is to himself  take thought and die for caesar 
and that were much he should  for he is given
to sports  to wildness and much company 


trebonius

there is no fear in him  let him not die 
for he will live  and laugh at this hereafter 
clock strikes


brutus

peace  count the clock 


cassius

the clock hath stricken three 


trebonius

 time to part 


cassius

                  but it is doubtful yet 
whether caesar will come forth to day  or no 
for he is superstitious grown of late 
quite from the main opinion he held once
of fantasy  of dreams and ceremonies 
it may be  these apparent prodigies 
the unaccustom terror of this night 
and the persuasion of his augurers 
may hold him from the capitol to day 


decius brutus

never fear that  if he be so resolved 
i can o him  for he loves to hear
that unicorns may be betray with trees 
and bears with glasses  elephants with holes 
lions with toils and men with flatterers 
but when i tell him he hates flatterers 
he says he does  being then most flattered 
let me work 
for i can give his humour the true bent 
and i will bring him to the capitol 


cassius

nay  we will all of us be there to fetch him 


brutus

by the eighth hour  is that the uttermost 


cinna

be that the uttermost  and fail not then 


metellus cimber

caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard 
who rated him for speaking well of pompey 
i wonder none of you have thought of him 


brutus

now  good metellus  go along by him 
he loves me well  and i have given him reasons 
send him but hither  and i fashion him 


cassius

the morning comes upon  s  we leave you  brutus 
and  friends  disperse yourselves  but all remember
what you have said  and show yourselves true romans 


brutus

good gentlemen  look fresh and merrily 
let not our looks put on our purposes 
but bear it as our roman actors do 
with untired spirits and formal constancy 
and so good morrow to you every one 
exeunt all but brutus
boy  lucius  fast asleep  it is no matter 
enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber 
thou hast no figures nor no fantasies 
which busy care draws in the brains of men 
therefore thou sleep so sound 
enter portia


portia

brutus  my lord 


brutus

portia  what mean you  wherefore rise you now 
it is not for your health thus to commit
your weak condition to the raw cold morning 


portia

nor for yours neither  you ungently  brutus 
stole from my bed  and yesternight  at supper 
you suddenly arose  and walk about 
musing and sighing  with your arms across 
and when i ask you what the matter was 
you stared upon me with ungentle looks 
i urged you further  then you scratch your head 
and too impatiently stamp with your foot 
yet i insisted  yet you answer not 
but  with an angry wafture of your hand 
gave sign for me to leave you  so i did 
fearing to strengthen that impatience
which seem too much enkindled  and withal
hoping it was but an effect of humour 
which sometime hath his hour with every man 
it will not let you eat  nor talk  nor sleep 
and could it work so much upon your shape
as it hath much prevail on your condition 
i should not know you  brutus  dear my lord 
make me acquainted with your cause of grief 


brutus

i am not well in health  and that is all 


portia

brutus is wise  and  were he not in health 
he would embrace the means to come by it 


brutus

why  so i do  good portia  go to bed 


portia

is brutus sick  and is it physical
to walk unbraced and suck up the humours
of the dank morning  what  is brutus sick 
and will he steal out of his wholesome bed 
to dare the vile contagion of the night
and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
to add unto his sickness  no  my brutus 
you have some sick offence within your mind 
which  by the right and virtue of my place 
i ought to know of  and  upon my knees 
i charm you  by my once commended beauty 
by all your vows of love and that great vow
which did incorporate and make us one 
that you unfold to me  yourself  your half 
why you are heavy  and what men to night
have had to resort to you  for here have been
some six or seven  who did hide their faces
even from darkness 


brutus

kneel not  gentle portia 


portia

i should not need  if you were gentle brutus 
within the bond of marriage  tell me  brutus 
is it excepted i should know no secrets
that appertain to you  am i yourself
but  as it were  in sort or limitation 
to keep with you at meals  comfort your bed 
and talk to you sometimes  dwell i but in the suburbs
of your good pleasure  if it be no more 
portia is brutus  harlot  not his wife 


brutus

you are my true and honourable wife 
as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
that visit my sad heart


portia

if this were true  then should i know this secret 
i grant i am a woman  but withal
a woman that lord brutus took to wife 
i grant i am a woman  but withal
a woman well reputed  cato daughter 
think you i am no stronger than my sex 
being so father and so husbanded 
tell me your counsels  i will not disclose  em 
i have made strong proof of my constancy 
giving myself a voluntary wound
here  in the thigh  can i bear that with patience 
and not my husband secrets 


brutus

o ye gods 
render me worthy of this noble wife 
knocking within
hark  hark  one knocks  portia  go in awhile 
and by and by thy bosom shall partake
the secrets of my heart 
all my engagements i will construe to thee 
all the charactery of my sad brows 
leave me with haste 
exit portia
lucius  who that knocks 
re enter lucius with ligarius


lucius

he is a sick man that would speak with you 


brutus

caius ligarius  that metellus spake of 
boy  stand aside  caius ligarius  how 


ligarius

vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue 


brutus

o  what a time have you chose out  brave caius 
to wear a kerchief  would you were not sick 


ligarius

i am not sick  if brutus have in hand
any exploit worthy the name of honour 


brutus

such an exploit have i in hand  ligarius 
had you a healthful ear to hear of it 


ligarius

by all the gods that romans bow before 
i here discard my sickness  soul of rome 
brave son  derived from honourable loins 
thou  like an exorcist  hast conjured up
my mortified spirit  now bid me run 
and i will strive with things impossible 
yea  get the better of them  what to do 


brutus

a piece of work that will make sick men whole 


ligarius

but are not some whole that we must make sick 


brutus

that must we also  what it is  my caius 
i shall unfold to thee  as we are going
to whom it must be done 


ligarius

set on your foot 
and with a heart new fired i follow you 
to do i know not what  but it sufficeth
that brutus leads me on 


brutus

follow me  then 
exeunt
