enter artemidorus  reading a paper


artemidorus

 caesar  beware of brutus  take heed of cassius 
come not near casca  have an eye to cinna  trust not
trebonius  mark well metellus cimber  decius brutus
loves thee not  thou hast wronged caius ligarius 
there is but one mind in all these men  and it is
bent against caesar  if thou beest not immortal 
look about you  security gives way to conspiracy 
the mighty gods defend thee  thy lover 
 artemidorus 
here will i stand till caesar pass along 
and as a suitor will i give him this 
my heart laments that virtue cannot live
out of the teeth of emulation 
if thou read this  o caesar  thou mayst live 
if not  the fates with traitors do contrive 
exit
