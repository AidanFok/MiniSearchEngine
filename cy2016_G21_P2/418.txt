scene iv  another part of the same street  before the house of brutus 


enter portia and lucius


portia

i prithee  boy  run to the senate house 
stay not to answer me  but get thee gone 
why dost thou stay 


lucius

to know my errand  madam 


portia

i would have had thee there  and here again 
ere i can tell thee what thou shouldst do there 
o constancy  be strong upon my side 
set a huge mountain  my heart and tongue 
i have a man mind  but a woman might 
how hard it is for women to keep counsel 
art thou here yet 


lucius

                  madam  what should i do 
run to the capitol  and nothing else 
and so return to you  and nothing else 


portia

yes  bring me word  boy  if thy lord look well 
for he went sickly forth  and take good note
what caesar doth  what suitors press to him 
hark  boy  what noise is that 


lucius

i hear none  madam 


portia

prithee  listen well 
i heard a bustling rumour  like a fray 
and the wind brings it from the capitol 


lucius

sooth  madam  i hear nothing 
enter the soothsayer


portia

come hither  fellow  which way hast thou been 


soothsayer

at mine own house  good lady 


portia

what is o clock 


soothsayer

                  about the ninth hour  lady 


portia

is caesar yet gone to the capitol 


soothsayer

madam  not yet  i go to take my stand 
to see him pass on to the capitol 


portia

thou hast some suit to caesar  hast thou not 


soothsayer

that i have  lady  if it will please caesar
to be so good to caesar as to hear me 
i shall beseech him to befriend himself 


portia

why  know thou any harm intended towards him 


soothsayer

none that i know will be  much that i fear may chance 
good morrow to you  here the street is narrow 
the throng that follows caesar at the heels 
of senators  of praetors  common suitors 
will crowd a feeble man almost to death 
i get me to a place more void  and there
speak to great caesar as he comes along 
exit


portia

i must go in  ay me  how weak a thing
the heart of woman is  o brutus 
the heavens speed thee in thine enterprise 
sure  the boy heard me  brutus hath a suit
that caesar will not grant  o  i grow faint 
run  lucius  and commend me to my lord 
say i am merry  come to me again 
and bring me word what he doth say to thee 
exeunt severally
