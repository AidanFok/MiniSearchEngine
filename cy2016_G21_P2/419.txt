brutus  what shall be done  if this be known 
cassius or caesar never shall turn back 
for i will slay myself 


brutus

cassius  be constant 
popilius lena speaks not of our purposes 
for  look  he smiles  and caesar doth not change 


cassius

trebonius knows his time  for  look you  brutus 
he draws mark antony out of the way 
exeunt antony and trebonius


decius brutus

where is metellus cimber  let him go 
and presently prefer his suit to caesar 


brutus

he is address d  press near and second him 


cinna

casca  you are the first that rears your hand 


caesar

are we all ready  what is now amiss
that caesar and his senate must redress 


metellus cimber

most high  most mighty  and most puissant caesar 
metellus cimber throws before thy seat
an humble heart 
kneeling


caesar

                  i must prevent thee  cimber 
these couchings and these lowly courtesies
might fire the blood of ordinary men 
and turn pre ordinance and first decree
into the law of children  be not fond 
to think that caesar bears such rebel blood
that will be thaw from the true quality
with that which melteth fools  i mean  sweet words 
low crooked court and base spaniel fawning 
thy brother by decree is banished 
if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him 
i spurn thee like a cur out of my way 
know  caesar doth not wrong  nor without cause
will he be satisfied 


metellus cimber

is there no voice more worthy than my own
to sound more sweetly in great caesar ear
for the repealing of my banish brother 


brutus

i kiss thy hand  but not in flattery  caesar 
desiring thee that publius cimber may
have an immediate freedom of repeal 


caesar

what  brutus 


cassius

                  pardon  caesar  caesar  pardon 
as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall 
to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber 


cassius

i could be well moved  if i were as you 
if i could pray to move  prayers would move me 
but i am constant as the northern star 
of whose true fix and resting quality
there is no fellow in the firmament 
the skies are painted with unnumber sparks 
they are all fire and every one doth shine 
but there but one in all doth hold his place 
so in the world   furnish well with men 
and men are flesh and blood  and apprehensive 
yet in the number i do know but one
that unassailable holds on his rank 
unshaked of motion  and that i am he 
let me a little show it  even in this 
that i was constant cimber should be banish d 
and constant do remain to keep him so 


cinna

o caesar 


caesar

          hence  wilt thou lift up olympus 


decius brutus

great caesar 


caesar

                  doth not brutus bootless kneel 


casca

speak  hands for me 
casca first  then the other conspirators and brutus stab caesar


caesar

et tu  brute  then fall  caesar 
dies


cinna

liberty  freedom  tyranny is dead 
run hence  proclaim  cry it about the streets 


cassius

some to the common pulpits  and cry out
 liberty  freedom  and enfranchisement 


brutus

people and senators  be not affrighted 
fly not  stand stiff  ambition debt is paid 


casca

go to the pulpit  brutus 


decius brutus

and cassius too 


brutus

where publius 


cinna

here  quite confounded with this mutiny 


metellus cimber

stand fast together  lest some friend of caesar 
should chance 


brutus

talk not of standing  publius  good cheer 
there is no harm intended to your person 
nor to no roman else  so tell them  publius 


cassius

and leave us  publius  lest that the people 
rushing on us  should do your age some mischief 


brutus

do so  and let no man abide this deed 
but we the doers 
re enter trebonius


cassius

                  where is antony 


trebonius

fled to his house amazed 
men  wives and children stare  cry out and run
as it were doomsday 


brutus

fates  we will know your pleasures 
that we shall die  we know   but the time
and drawing days out  that men stand upon 


cassius

why  he that cuts off twenty years of life
cuts off so many years of fearing death 


brutus

grant that  and then is death a benefit 
so are we caesar friends  that have abridged
his time of fearing death  stoop  romans  stoop 
and let us bathe our hands in caesar blood
up to the elbows  and besmear our swords 
then walk we forth  even to the market place 
and  waving our red weapons o our heads 
let all cry  peace  freedom and liberty 


cassius

stoop  then  and wash  how many ages hence
shall this our lofty scene be acted over
in states unborn and accents yet unknown 


brutus

how many times shall caesar bleed in sport 
that now on pompey basis lies along
no worthier than the dust 


cassius

so oft as that shall be 
so often shall the knot of us be call 
the men that gave their country liberty 


decius brutus

what  shall we forth 


cassius

ay  every man away 
brutus shall lead  and we will grace his heels
with the most boldest and best hearts of rome 
enter a servant


brutus

soft  who comes here  a friend of antony s 


servant

thus  brutus  did my master bid me kneel 
thus did mark antony bid me fall down 
and  being prostrate  thus he bade me say 
brutus is noble  wise  valiant  and honest 
caesar was mighty  bold  royal  and loving 
say i love brutus  and i honour him 
say i fear caesar  honour him and loved him 
if brutus will vouchsafe that antony
may safely come to him  and be resolved
how caesar hath deserved to lie in death 
mark antony shall not love caesar dead
so well as brutus living  but will follow
the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus
thorough the hazards of this untrod state
with all true faith  so says my master antony 


brutus

thy master is a wise and valiant roman 
i never thought him worse 
tell him  so please him come unto this place 
he shall be satisfied  and  by my honour 
depart untouch d 


servant

                  i fetch him presently 
exit


brutus

i know that we shall have him well to friend 


cassius

i wish we may  but yet have i a mind
that fears him much  and my misgiving still
falls shrewdly to the purpose 


brutus

but here comes antony 
re enter antony
welcome  mark antony 


antony

o mighty caesar  dost thou lie so low 
are all thy conquests  glories  triumphs  spoils 
shrunk to this little measure  fare thee well 
i know not  gentlemen  what you intend 
who else must be let blood  who else is rank 
if i myself  there is no hour so fit
as caesar death hour  nor no instrument
of half that worth as those your swords  made rich
with the most noble blood of all this world 
i do beseech ye  if you bear me hard 
now  whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke 
fulfil your pleasure  live a thousand years 
i shall not find myself so apt to die 
no place will please me so  no mean of death 
as here by caesar  and by you cut off 
the choice and master spirits of this age 


brutus

o antony  beg not your death of us 
though now we must appear bloody and cruel 
as  by our hands and this our present act 
you see we do  yet see you but our hands
and this the bleeding business they have done 
our hearts you see not  they are pitiful 
and pity to the general wrong of rome 
as fire drives out fire  so pity pity 
hath done this deed on caesar  for your part 
to you our swords have leaden points  mark antony 
our arms  in strength of malice  and our hearts
of brothers  temper  do receive you in
with all kind love  good thoughts  and reverence 


cassius

your voice shall be as strong as any man 
in the disposing of new dignities 


brutus

only be patient till we have appeased
the multitude  beside themselves with fear 
and then we will deliver you the cause 
why i  that did love caesar when i struck him 
have thus proceeded 


antony

i doubt not of your wisdom 
let each man render me his bloody hand 
first  marcus brutus  will i shake with you 
next  caius cassius  do i take your hand 
now  decius brutus  yours  now yours  metellus 
yours  cinna  and  my valiant casca  yours 
though last  not last in love  yours  good trebonius 
gentlemen all alas  what shall i say 
my credit now stands on such slippery ground 
that one of two bad ways you must conceit me 
either a coward or a flatterer 
that i did love thee  caesar  o   true 
if then thy spirit look upon us now 
shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death 
to see thy thy anthony making his peace 
shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes 
most noble  in the presence of thy corse 
had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds 
weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood 
it would become me better than to close
in terms of friendship with thine enemies 
pardon me  julius  here wast thou bay d  brave hart 
here didst thou fall  and here thy hunters stand 
sign in thy spoil  and crimson in thy lethe 
o world  thou wast the forest to this hart 
and this  indeed  o world  the heart of thee 
how like a deer  strucken by many princes 
dost thou here lie 


cassius

mark antony 


antony

                  pardon me  caius cassius 
the enemies of caesar shall say this 
then  in a friend  it is cold modesty 


cassius

i blame you not for praising caesar so 
but what compact mean you to have with us 
will you be prick in number of our friends 
or shall we on  and not depend on you 


antony

therefore i took your hands  but was  indeed 
sway from the point  by looking down on caesar 
friends am i with you all and love you all 
upon this hope  that you shall give me reasons
why and wherein caesar was dangerous 


brutus

or else were this a savage spectacle 
our reasons are so full of good regard
that were you  antony  the son of caesar 
you should be satisfied 


antony

that all i seek 
and am moreover suitor that i may
produce his body to the market place 
and in the pulpit  as becomes a friend 
speak in the order of his funeral 


brutus

you shall  mark antony 


cassius

brutus  a word with you 
aside to brutus
you know not what you do  do not consent
that antony speak in his funeral 
know you how much the people may be moved
by that which he will utter 


brutus

by your pardon 
i will myself into the pulpit first 
and show the reason of our caesar death 
what antony shall speak  i will protest
he speaks by leave and by permission 
and that we are contented caesar shall
have all true rites and lawful ceremonies 
it shall advantage more than do us wrong 


cassius

i know not what may fall  i like it not 


brutus

mark antony  here  take you caesar body 
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us 
but speak all good you can devise of caesar 
and say you do by our permission 
else shall you not have any hand at all
about his funeral  and you shall speak
in the same pulpit whereto i am going 
after my speech is ended 


antony

be it so 
i do desire no more 


brutus

prepare the body then  and follow us 
exeunt all but antony


antony

o  pardon me  thou bleeding piece of earth 
that i am meek and gentle with these butchers 
thou art the ruins of the noblest man
that ever lived in the tide of times 
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood 
over thy wounds now do i prophesy 
which  like dumb mouths  do ope their ruby lips 
to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue 
a curse shall light upon the limbs of men 
domestic fury and fierce civil strife
shall cumber all the parts of italy 
blood and destruction shall be so in use
and dreadful objects so familiar
that mothers shall but smile when they behold
their infants quarter with the hands of war 
all pity choked with custom of fell deeds 
and caesar spirit  ranging for revenge 
with ate by his side come hot from hell 
shall in these confines with a monarch voice
cry   havoc  and let slip the dogs of war 
that this foul deed shall smell above the earth
with carrion men  groaning for burial 
enter a servant
you serve octavius caesar  do you not 


servant

i do  mark antony 


antony

caesar did write for him to come to rome 


servant

he did receive his letters  and is coming 
and bid me say to you by word of mouth 
o caesar 
seeing the body


antony

thy heart is big  get thee apart and weep 
passion  i see  is catching  for mine eyes 
seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine 
began to water  is thy master coming 


servant

he lies to night within seven leagues of rome 


antony

post back with speed  and tell him what hath chanced 
here is a mourning rome  a dangerous rome 
no rome of safety for octavius yet 
hie hence  and tell him so  yet  stay awhile 
thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse
into the market place  there shall i try
in my oration  how the people take
the cruel issue of these bloody men 
according to the which  thou shalt discourse
to young octavius of the state of things 
lend me your hand 
exeunt with caesar body
