the regent conquers  and the frenchmen fly 
now help  ye charming spells and periapts 
and ye choice spirits that admonish me
and give me signs of future accidents 
thunder
you speedy helpers  that are substitutes
under the lordly monarch of the north 
appear and aid me in this enterprise 
enter fiends
this speedy and quick appearance argues proof
of your accustom diligence to me 
now  ye familiar spirits  that are cull 
out of the powerful regions under earth 
help me this once  that france may get the field 
they walk  and speak not
o  hold me not with silence over long 
where i was wont to feed you with my blood 
i lop a member off and give it you
in earnest of further benefit 
so you do condescend to help me now 
they hang their heads
no hope to have redress  my body shall
pay recompense  if you will grant my suit 
they shake their heads
cannot my body nor blood sacrifice
entreat you to your wonted furtherance 
then take my soul  my body  soul and all 
before that england give the french the foil 
they depart
see  they forsake me  now the time is come
that france must vail her lofty plumed crest
and let her head fall into england lap 
my ancient incantations are too weak 
and hell too strong for me to buckle with 
now  france  thy glory droopeth to the dust

alarum  enter suffolk with margaret in his hand


suffolk

be what thou wilt  thou art my prisoner 
gazes on her
o fairest beauty  do not fear nor fly 
for i will touch thee but with reverent hands 
i kiss these fingers for eternal peace 
and lay them gently on thy tender side 
who art thou  say  that i may honour thee 


margaret

margaret my name  and daughter to a king 
the king of naples  whosoe thou art 


suffolk

an earl i am  and suffolk am i call d 
be not offended  nature miracle 
thou art allotted to be ta by me 
so doth the swan her downy cygnets save 
keeping them prisoner underneath her wings 
yet  if this servile usage once offend 
go  and be free again  as suffolk friend 
she is going
o  stay  i have no power to let her pass 
my hand would free her  but my heart says no
as plays the sun upon the glassy streams 
twinkling another counterfeited beam 
so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes 
fain would i woo her  yet i dare not speak 
i call for pen and ink  and write my mind 
fie  de la pole  disable not thyself 
hast not a tongue  is she not here 
wilt thou be daunted at a woman sight 
ay  beauty princely majesty is such 
confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough 


margaret

say  earl of suffolk if thy name be so 
what ransom must i pay before i pass 
for i perceive i am thy prisoner 


suffolk

how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit 
before thou make a trial of her love 


margaret

why speak thou not  what ransom must i pay 


suffolk

she beautiful  and therefore to be woo d 
she is a woman  therefore to be won 


margaret

wilt thou accept of ransom  yea  or no 


suffolk

fond man  remember that thou hast a wife 
then how can margaret be thy paramour 


margaret

i were best to leave him  for he will not hear 


suffolk

there all is marr d  there lies a cooling card 


margaret

he talks at random  sure  the man is mad 


suffolk

and yet a dispensation may be had 


margaret

and yet i would that you would answer me 


suffolk

i win this lady margaret  for whom 
why  for my king  tush  that a wooden thing 


margaret

he talks of wood  it is some carpenter 


suffolk

yet so my fancy may be satisfied 
and peace established between these realms
but there remains a scruple in that too 
for though her father be the king of naples 
duke of anjou and maine  yet is he poor 
and our nobility will scorn the match 


margaret

hear ye  captain  are you not at leisure 


suffolk

it shall be so  disdain they ne so much 
henry is youthful and will quickly yield 
madam  i have a secret to reveal 


margaret

what though i be enthrall d  he seems a knight 
and will not any way dishonour me 


suffolk

lady  vouchsafe to listen what i say 


margaret

perhaps i shall be rescued by the french 
and then i need not crave his courtesy 


suffolk

sweet madam  give me a hearing in a cause 


margaret

tush  women have been captivate ere now 


suffolk

lady  wherefore talk you so 


margaret

i cry you mercy   but quid for quo 


suffolk

say  gentle princess  would you not suppose
your bondage happy  to be made a queen 


margaret

to be a queen in bondage is more vile
than is a slave in base servility 
for princes should be free 


suffolk

and so shall you 
if happy england royal king be free 


margaret

why  what concerns his freedom unto me 


suffolk

i undertake to make thee henry queen 
to put a golden sceptre in thy hand
and set a precious crown upon thy head 
if thou wilt condescend to be my 


margaret

what 


suffolk

his love 


margaret

i am unworthy to be henry wife 


suffolk

no  gentle madam  i unworthy am
to woo so fair a dame to be his wife 
and have no portion in the choice myself 
how say you  madam  are ye so content 


margaret

an if my father please  i am content 


suffolk

then call our captains and our colours forth 
and  madam  at your father castle walls
we crave a parley  to confer with him 
a parley sounded  enter reignier on the walls
see  reignier  see  thy daughter prisoner 


reignier

to whom 


suffolk

       to me 


reignier

                  suffolk  what remedy 
i am a soldier  and unapt to weep 
or to exclaim on fortune fickleness 


su ffolk

yes  there is remedy enough  my lord 
consent  and for thy honour give consent 
thy daughter shall be wedded to my king 
whom i with pain have woo and won thereto 
and this her easy held imprisonment
hath gained thy daughter princely liberty 


reignier

speaks suffolk as he thinks 


suffolk

fair margaret knows
that suffolk doth not flatter  face  or feign 


reignier

upon thy princely warrant  i descend
to give thee answer of thy just demand 
exit from the walls


suffolk

and here i will expect thy coming 
trumpets sound  enter reignier  below


reignier

welcome  brave earl  into our territories 
command in anjou what your honour pleases 


suffolk

thanks  reignier  happy for so sweet a child 
fit to be made companion with a king 
what answer makes your grace unto my suit 


reignier

since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
to be the princely bride of such a lord 
upon condition i may quietly
enjoy mine own  the country maine and anjou 
free from oppression or the stroke of war 
my daughter shall be henry s  if he please 


suffolk

that is her ransom  i deliver her 
and those two counties i will undertake
your grace shall well and quietly enjoy 


reignier

and i again  in henry royal name 
as deputy unto that gracious king 
give thee her hand  for sign of plighted faith 


suffolk

reignier of france  i give thee kingly thanks 
because this is in traffic of a king 
aside
and yet  methinks  i could be well content
to be mine own attorney in this case 
i over then to england with this news 
and make this marriage to be solemnized 
so farewell  reignier  set this diamond safe
in golden palaces  as it becomes 


reignier

i do embrace thee  as i would embrace
the christian prince  king henry  were he here 


margaret

farewell  my lord  good wishes  praise and prayers
shall suffolk ever have of margaret 
going


suffolk

farewell  sweet madam  but hark you  margaret 
no princely commendations to my king 


margaret

such commendations as becomes a maid 
a virgin and his servant  say to him 


suffolk

words sweetly placed and modestly directed 
but madam  i must trouble you again 
no loving token to his majesty 


margaret

yes  my good lord  a pure unspotted heart 
never yet taint with love  i send the king 


suffolk

and this withal 
kisses her


margaret

that for thyself  i will not so presume
to send such peevish tokens to a king 
exeunt reignier and margaret


suffolk

o  wert thou for myself  but  suffolk  stay 
thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth 
there minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk 
solicit henry with her wondrous praise 
bethink thee on her virtues that surmount 
and natural graces that extinguish art 
repeat their semblance often on the seas 
that  when thou comest to kneel at henry feet 
thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder
