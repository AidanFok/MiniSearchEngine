enter brutus and cassius  and a throng of citizens


citizens

we will be satisfied  let us be satisfied 


brutus

then follow me  and give me audience  friends 
cassius  go you into the other street 
and part the numbers 
those that will hear me speak  let  stay here 
those that will follow cassius  go with him 
and public reasons shall be rendered
of caesar death 


first citizen

                  i will hear brutus speak 


second citizen

i will hear cassius  and compare their reasons 
when severally we hear them rendered 
exit cassius  with some of the citizens  brutus goes into the pulpit


third citizen

the noble brutus is ascended  silence 


brutus

be patient till the last 
romans  countrymen  and lovers  hear me for my
cause  and be silent  that you may hear  believe me
for mine honour  and have respect to mine honour  that
you may believe  censure me in your wisdom  and
awake your senses  that you may the better judge 
if there be any in this assembly  any dear friend of
caesar s  to him i say  that brutus  love to caesar
was no less than his  if then that friend demand
why brutus rose against caesar  this is my answer 
 not that i loved caesar less  but that i loved
rome more  had you rather caesar were living and
die all slaves  than that caesar were dead  to live
all free men  as caesar loved me  i weep for him 
as he was fortunate  i rejoice at it  as he was
valiant  i honour him  but  as he was ambitious  i
slew him  there is tears for his love  joy for his
fortune  honour for his valour  and death for his
ambition  who is here so base that would be a
bondman  if any  speak  for him have i offended 
who is here so rude that would not be a roman  if
any  speak  for him have i offended  who is here so
vile that will not love his country  if any  speak 
for him have i offended  i pause for a reply 


all

none  brutus  none 


brutus

then none have i offended  i have done no more to
caesar than you shall do to brutus  the question of
his death is enrolled in the capitol  his glory not
extenuated  wherein he was worthy  nor his offences
enforced  for which he suffered death 
enter antony and others  with caesar body
here comes his body  mourned by mark antony  who 
though he had no hand in his death  shall receive
the benefit of his dying  a place in the
commonwealth  as which of you shall not  with this
i depart that  as i slew my best lover for the
good of rome  i have the same dagger for myself 
when it shall please my country to need my death

you gentle romans 


citizens

peace  ho  let us hear him 


antony

friends  romans  countrymen  lend me your ears 
i come to bury caesar  not to praise him 
the evil that men do lives after them 
the good is oft interred with their bones 
so let it be with caesar  the noble brutus
hath told you caesar was ambitious 
if it were so  it was a grievous fault 
and grievously hath caesar answer it 
here  under leave of brutus and the rest 
for brutus is an honourable man 
so are they all  all honourable men 
come i to speak in caesar funeral 
he was my friend  faithful and just to me 
but brutus says he was ambitious 
and brutus is an honourable man 
he hath brought many captives home to rome
whose ransoms did the general coffers fill 
did this in caesar seem ambitious 
when that the poor have cried  caesar hath wept 
ambition should be made of sterner stuff 
yet brutus says he was ambitious 
and brutus is an honourable man 
you all did see that on the lupercal
i thrice presented him a kingly crown 
which he did thrice refuse  was this ambition 
yet brutus says he was ambitious 
and  sure  he is an honourable man 
i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke 
but here i am to speak what i do know 
you all did love him once  not without cause 
what cause withholds you then  to mourn for him 
o judgment  thou art fled to brutish beasts 
and men have lost their reason  bear with me 
my heart is in the coffin there with caesar 
and i must pause till it come back to me 


first citizen

methinks there is much reason in his sayings 


second citizen

if thou consider rightly of the matter 
caesar has had great wrong 


third citizen

has he  masters 
i fear there will a worse come in his place 


fourth citizen

mark ye his words  he would not take the crown 
therefore  certain he was not ambitious 


first citizen

if it be found so  some will dear abide it 


second citizen

poor soul  his eyes are red as fire with weeping 


third citizen

there not a nobler man in rome than antony 


fourth citizen

now mark him  he begins again to speak 


antony

but yesterday the word of caesar might
have stood against the world  now lies he there 
and none so poor to do him reverence 
o masters  if i were disposed to stir
your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage 
i should do brutus wrong  and cassius wrong 
who  you all know  are honourable men 
i will not do them wrong  i rather choose
to wrong the dead  to wrong myself and you 
than i will wrong such honourable men 
but here a parchment with the seal of caesar 
i found it in his closet   his will 
let but the commons hear this testament 
which  pardon me  i do not mean to read 
and they would go and kiss dead caesar wounds
and dip their napkins in his sacred blood 
yea  beg a hair of him for memory 
and  dying  mention it within their wills 
bequeathing it as a rich legacy
unto their issue 


fourth citizen

we hear the will  read it  mark antony 


all

the will  the will  we will hear caesar will 


antony

have patience  gentle friends  i must not read it 
it is not meet you know how caesar loved you 
you are not wood  you are not stones  but men 
and  being men  bearing the will of caesar 
it will inflame you  it will make you mad 
 good you know not that you are his heirs 
for  if you should  o  what would come of it 


fourth citizen

read the will  we hear it  antony 
you shall read us the will  caesar will 


antony

will you be patient  will you stay awhile 
i have o myself to tell you of it 
i fear i wrong the honourable men
whose daggers have stabb caesar  i do fear it 


fourth citizen

they were traitors  honourable men 


all

the will  the testament 


second citizen

they were villains  murderers  the will  read the will 


antony

you will compel me  then  to read the will 
then make a ring about the corpse of caesar 
and let me show you him that made the will 
shall i descend  and will you give me leave 


several citizens

come down 


second citizen

third citizen

nay  press not so upon me  stand far off 


several citizens

stand back  room  bear back 


antony

if you have tears  prepare to shed them now 
you all do know this mantle  i remember
the first time ever caesar put it on 
 on a summer evening  in his tent 
that day he overcame the nervii 
look  in this place ran cassius  dagger through 
see what a rent the envious casca made 
through this the well beloved brutus stabb d 
and as he pluck his cursed steel away 
mark how the blood of caesar follow it 
as rushing out of doors  to be resolved
if brutus so unkindly knock d  or no 
for brutus  as you know  was caesar angel 
judge  o you gods  how dearly caesar loved him 
this was the most unkindest cut of all 
for when the noble caesar saw him stab 
ingratitude  more strong than traitors  arms 
quite vanquish him  then burst his mighty heart 
and  in his mantle muffling up his face 
even at the base of pompey statua 
which all the while ran blood  great caesar fell 
o  what a fall was there  my countrymen 
then i  and you  and all of us fell down 
whilst bloody treason flourish over us 
o  now you weep  and  i perceive  you feel
the dint of pity  these are gracious drops 
kind souls  what  weep you when you but behold
our caesar vesture wounded  look you here 
here is himself  marr d  as you see  with traitors 


first citizen

o piteous spectacle 


second citizen

o noble caesar 


third citizen

o woful day 


fourth citizen

o traitors  villains 


first citizen

o most bloody sight 


second citizen

we will be revenged 


all

revenge  about  seek  burn  fire  kill  slay 
let not a traitor live 


antony

stay  countrymen 


first citizen

peace there  hear the noble antony 


second citizen

we hear him  we follow him  we die with him 


antony

good friends  sweet friends  let me not stir you up
to such a sudden flood of mutiny 
they that have done this deed are honourable 
what private griefs they have  alas  i know not 
that made them do it  they are wise and honourable 
and will  no doubt  with reasons answer you 
i come not  friends  to steal away your hearts 
i am no orator  as brutus is 
but  as you know me all  a plain blunt man 
that love my friend  and that they know full well
that gave me public leave to speak of him 
for i have neither wit  nor words  nor worth 
action  nor utterance  nor the power of speech 
to stir men blood  i only speak right on 
i tell you that which you yourselves do know 
show you sweet caesar wounds  poor poor dumb mouths 
and bid them speak for me  but were i brutus 
and brutus antony  there were an antony
would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
in every wound of caesar that should move
the stones of rome to rise and mutiny 


all

we mutiny 


first citizen

we burn the house of brutus 


third citizen

yet hear me  countrymen  yet hear me speak 


all

peace  ho  hear antony  most noble antony 


antony

why  friends  you go to do you know not what 
wherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves 
alas  you know not  i must tell you then 
you have forgot the will i told you of 


all

most true  the will  let stay and hear the will 


antony

here is the will  and under caesar seal 
to every roman citizen he gives 
to every several man  seventy five drachmas 


second citizen

most noble caesar  we revenge his death 


third citizen

o royal caesar 


antony

hear me with patience 


all

peace  ho 


antony

moreover  he hath left you all his walks 
his private arbours and new planted orchards 
on this side tiber  he hath left them you 
and to your heirs for ever  common pleasures 
to walk abroad  and recreate yourselves 
here was a caesar  when comes such another 


first citizen

never  never  come  away  away 
we burn his body in the holy place 
and with the brands fire the traitors  houses 
take up the body 


second citizen

go fetch fire 


third citizen

pluck down benches 


fourth citizen

pluck down forms  windows  any thing 
exeunt citizens with the body


antony

now let it work  mischief  thou art afoot 
take thou what course thou wilt 
enter a servant
how now  fellow

he comes upon a wish  fortune is merry 
and in this mood will give us any thing

are rid like madmen through the gates of rome 


antony

how i had moved them  bring me to octavius 
exeunt
