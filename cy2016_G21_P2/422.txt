scene i  a house in rome 


antony  octavius  and lepidus  seated at a table


antony

these many  then  shall die  their names are prick d 


octavius

your brother too must die  consent you  lepidus 


lepidus

i do consent 


octavius

                  prick him down  antony 


lepidus

upon condition publius shall not live 
who is your sister son  mark antony 


antony

he shall not live  look  with a spot i damn him 
but  lepidus  go you to caesar house 
fetch the will hither  and we shall determine
how to cut off some charge in legacies 


lepidus

what  shall i find you here 


octavius

or here  or at the capitol 
exit lepidus


antony

this is a slight unmeritable man 
meet to be sent on errands  is it fit 
the three fold world divided  he should stand
one of the three to share it 


octavius

so you thought him 
and took his voice who should be prick to die 
in our black sentence and proscription 


antony

octavius  i have seen more days than you 
and though we lay these honours on this man 
to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads 
he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold 
to groan and sweat under the business 
either led or driven  as we point the way 
and having brought our treasure where we will 
then take we down his load  and turn him off 
like to the empty ass  to shake his ears 
and graze in commons 


octavius

you may do your will 
but he a tried and valiant soldier 


antony

so is my horse  octavius  and for that
i do appoint him store of provender 
it is a creature that i teach to fight 
to wind  to stop  to run directly on 
his corporal motion govern by my spirit 
and  in some taste  is lepidus but so 
he must be taught and train and bid go forth 
a barren spirited fellow  one that feeds
on abjects  orts and imitations 
which  out of use and staled by other men 
begin his fashion  do not talk of him 
but as a property  and now  octavius 
listen great things brutus and cassius
are levying powers  we must straight make head 
therefore let our alliance be combined 
our best friends made  our means stretch 
and let us presently go sit in council 
how covert matters may be best disclosed 
and open perils surest answered 


octavius

let us do so  for we are at the stake 
and bay about with many enemies 
and some that smile have in their hearts  i fear 
millions of mischiefs 
exeunt
