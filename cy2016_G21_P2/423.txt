scene ii  camp near sardis  before brutus tent 


drum  enter brutus  lucilius  lucius  and soldiers  titinius and pindarus meeting them


brutus

stand  ho 


lucilius

give the word  ho  and stand 


brutus

what now  lucilius  is cassius near 


lucilius

he is at hand  and pindarus is come
to do you salutation from his master 


brutus

he greets me well  your master  pindarus 
in his own change  or by ill officers 
hath given me some worthy cause to wish
things done  undone  but  if he be at hand 
i shall be satisfied 


pindarus

i do not doubt
but that my noble master will appear
such as he is  full of regard and honour 


brutus

he is not doubted  a word  lucilius 
how he received you  let me be resolved 


lucilius

with courtesy and with respect enough 
but not with such familiar instances 
nor with such free and friendly conference 
as he hath used of old 


brutus

thou hast described
a hot friend cooling  ever note  lucilius 
when love begins to sicken and decay 
it useth an enforced ceremony 
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith 
but hollow men  like horses hot at hand 
make gallant show and promise of their mettle 
but when they should endure the bloody spur 
they fall their crests  and  like deceitful jades 
sink in the trial  comes his army on 


lucilius

they mean this night in sardis to be quarter d 
the greater part  the horse in general 
are come with cassius 


brutus

hark  he is arrived 
low march within
march gently on to meet him 
enter cassius and his powers


cassius

stand  ho 


brutus

stand  ho  speak the word along 


first soldier

stand 


second soldier

stand 


third soldier

stand 


cassius

most noble brother  you have done me wrong 


brutus

judge me  you gods  wrong i mine enemies 
and  if not so  how should i wrong a brother 


cassius

brutus  this sober form of yours hides wrongs 
and when you do them 


brutus

cassius  be content 
speak your griefs softly  i do know you well 
before the eyes of both our armies here 
which should perceive nothing but love from us 
let us not wrangle  bid them move away 
then in my tent  cassius  enlarge your griefs 
and i will give you audience 


cassius

pindarus 
bid our commanders lead their charges off
a little from this ground 


brutus

lucilius  do you the like  and let no man
come to our tent till we have done our conference 
let lucius and titinius guard our door 
exeunt
