scene iii  brutus tent 


enter brutus and cassius


cassius

that you have wrong me doth appear in this 
you have condemn and noted lucius pella
for taking bribes here of the sardians 
wherein my letters  praying on his side 
because i knew the man  were slighted off 


brutus

you wronged yourself to write in such a case 


cassius

in such a time as this it is not meet
that every nice offence should bear his comment 


brutus

let me tell you  cassius  you yourself
are much condemn to have an itching palm 
to sell and mart your offices for gold
to undeservers 


cassius

                  i an itching palm 
you know that you are brutus that speak this 
or  by the gods  this speech were else your last 


brutus

the name of cassius honours this corruption 
and chastisement doth therefore hide his head 


cassius

chastisement 


brutus

remember march  the ides of march remember 
did not great julius bleed for justice  sake 
what villain touch his body  that did stab 
and not for justice  what  shall one of us
that struck the foremost man of all this world
but for supporting robbers  shall we now
contaminate our fingers with base bribes 
and sell the mighty space of our large honours
for so much trash as may be grasped thus 
i had rather be a dog  and bay the moon 
than such a roman 


cassius

                  brutus  bay not me 
i not endure it  you forget yourself 
to hedge me in  i am a soldier  i 
older in practise  abler than yourself
to make conditions 


brutus

go to  you are not  cassius 


cassius

i am 


brutus

i say you are not 


cassius

urge me no more  i shall forget myself 
have mind upon your health  tempt me no further 


brutus

away  slight man 


cassius

is possible 


brutus

                  hear me  for i will speak 
must i give way and room to your rash choler 
shall i be frighted when a madman stares 


cassius

o ye gods  ye gods  must i endure all this 


brutus

all this  ay  more  fret till your proud heart break 
go show your slaves how choleric you are 
and make your bondmen tremble  must i budge 
must i observe you  must i stand and crouch
under your testy humour  by the gods
you shall digest the venom of your spleen 
though it do split you  for  from this day forth 
i use you for my mirth  yea  for my laughter 
when you are waspish 


cassius

is it come to this 


brutus

you say you are a better soldier 
let it appear so  make your vaunting true 
and it shall please me well  for mine own part 
i shall be glad to learn of noble men 


cassius

you wrong me every way  you wrong me  brutus 
i said  an elder soldier  not a better 
did i say  better 


brutus

if you did  i care not 


cassius

when caesar lived  he durst not thus have moved me 


brutus

peace  peace  you durst not so have tempted him 


cassius

i durst not 


brutus

no 


cassius

what  durst not tempt him 


brutus

for your life you durst not 


cassius

do not presume too much upon my love 
i may do that i shall be sorry for 


brutus

you have done that you should be sorry for 
there is no terror  cassius  in your threats 
for i am arm so strong in honesty
that they pass by me as the idle wind 
which i respect not  i did send to you
for certain sums of gold  which you denied me 
for i can raise no money by vile means 
by heaven  i had rather coin my heart 
and drop my blood for drachmas  than to wring
from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
by any indirection  i did send
to you for gold to pay my legions 
which you denied me  was that done like cassius 
should i have answer caius cassius so 
when marcus brutus grows so covetous 
to lock such rascal counters from his friends 
be ready  gods  with all your thunderbolts 
dash him to pieces 


cassius

i denied you not 


brutus

you did 


cassius

i did not  he was but a fool that brought
my answer back  brutus hath rived my heart 
a friend should bear his friend infirmities 
but brutus makes mine greater than they are 


brutus

i do not  till you practise them on me 


cassius

you love me not 


brutus

                  i do not like your faults 


cassius

a friendly eye could never see such faults 


brutus

a flatterer would not  though they do appear
as huge as high olympus 


cassius

come  antony  and young octavius  come 
revenge yourselves alone on cassius 
for cassius is aweary of the world 
hated by one he loves  braved by his brother 
cheque like a bondman  all his faults observed 
set in a note book  learn d  and conn by rote 
to cast into my teeth  o  i could weep
my spirit from mine eyes  there is my dagger 
and here my naked breast  within  a heart
dearer than plutus  mine  richer than gold 
if that thou be a roman  take it forth 
i  that denied thee gold  will give my heart 
strike  as thou didst at caesar  for  i know 
when thou didst hate him worst  thou lovedst him better
than ever thou lovedst cassius 


brutus

sheathe your dagger 
be angry when you will  it shall have scope 
do what you will  dishonour shall be humour 
o cassius  you are yoked with a lamb
that carries anger as the flint bears fire 
who  much enforced  shows a hasty spark 
and straight is cold again 


cassius

hath cassius lived
to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus 
when grief  and blood ill temper d  vexeth him 


brutus

when i spoke that  i was ill temper too 


cassius

do you confess so much  give me your hand 


brutus

and my heart too 


cassius

                  o brutus 


brutus

what the matter 


cassius

have not you love enough to bear with me 
when that rash humour which my mother gave me
makes me forgetful 


brutus

yes  cassius  and  from henceforth 
when you are over earnest with your brutus 
he think your mother chides  and leave you so 


poet

 within   let me go in to see the generals 
there is some grudge between  em   not meet
they be alone 


lucilius

 within   you shall not come to them 


poet

 within   nothing but death shall stay me 
enter poet  followed by lucilius  titinius  and lucius


cassius

how now  what the matter 


poet

for shame  you generals  what do you mean 
love  and be friends  as two such men should be 
for i have seen more years  i sure  than ye 


cassius

ha  ha  how vilely doth this cynic rhyme 


brutus

get you hence  sirrah  saucy fellow  hence 


cassius

bear with him  brutus   his fashion 


brutus

i know his humour  when he knows his time 
what should the wars do with these jigging fools 
companion  hence 


cassius

                  away  away  be gone 
exit poet


brutus

lucilius and titinius  bid the commanders
prepare to lodge their companies to night 


cassius

and come yourselves  and bring messala with you
immediately to us 
exeunt lucilius and titinius


brutus

lucius  a bowl of wine 
exit lucius


cassius

i did not think you could have been so angry 


brutus

o cassius  i am sick of many griefs 


cassius

of your philosophy you make no use 
if you give place to accidental evils 


brutus

no man bears sorrow better  portia is dead 


cassius

ha  portia 


brutus

she is dead 


cassius

how  i killing when i cross you so 
o insupportable and touching loss 
upon what sickness 


brutus

impatient of my absence 
and grief that young octavius with mark antony
have made themselves so strong for with her death
that tidings came with this she fell distract 
and  her attendants absent  swallow fire 


cassius

and died so 


brutus

                  even so 


cassius

o ye immortal gods 
re enter lucius  with wine and taper


brutus

speak no more of her  give me a bowl of wine 
in this i bury all unkindness  cassius 


cassius

my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge 
fill  lucius  till the wine o the cup 
i cannot drink too much of brutus  love 


brutus

come in  titinius 
exit lucius
re enter titinius  with messala
welcome  good messala 
now sit we close about this taper here 
and call in question our necessities 


cassius

portia  art thou gone 


brutus

no more  i pray you 
messala  i have here received letters 
that young octavius and mark antony
come down upon us with a mighty power 
bending their expedition toward philippi 


messala

myself have letters of the selfsame tenor 


brutus

with what addition 


messala

that by proscription and bills of outlawry 
octavius  antony  and lepidus 
have put to death an hundred senators 


brutus

therein our letters do not well agree 
mine speak of seventy senators that died
by their proscriptions  cicero being one 


cassius

cicero one 


messala

          cicero is dead 
and by that order of proscription 
had you your letters from your wife  my lord 


brutus

no  messala 


messala

nor nothing in your letters writ of her 


brutus

nothing  messala 


messala

                  that  methinks  is strange 


brutus

why ask you  hear you aught of her in yours 


messala

no  my lord 


brutus

now  as you are a roman  tell me true 


messala

then like a roman bear the truth i tell 
for certain she is dead  and by strange manner 


brutus

why  farewell  portia  we must die  messala 
with meditating that she must die once 
i have the patience to endure it now 


messala

even so great men great losses should endure 


cassius

i have as much of this in art as you 
but yet my nature could not bear it so 


brutus

well  to our work alive  what do you think
of marching to philippi presently 


cassius

i do not think it good 


brutus

your reason 


cassius

this it is 
 better that the enemy seek us 
so shall he waste his means  weary his soldiers 
doing himself offence  whilst we  lying still 
are full of rest  defense  and nimbleness 


brutus

good reasons must  of force  give place to better 
the people  philippi and this ground
do stand but in a forced affection 
for they have grudged us contribution 
the enemy  marching along by them 
by them shall make a fuller number up 
come on refresh d  new added  and encouraged 
from which advantage shall we cut him off 
if at philippi we do face him there 
these people at our back 


cassius

hear me  good brother 


brutus

under your pardon  you must note beside 
that we have tried the utmost of our friends 
our legions are brim full  our cause is ripe 
the enemy increaseth every day 
we  at the height  are ready to decline 
there is a tide in the affairs of men 
which  taken at the flood  leads on to fortune 
omitted  all the voyage of their life
is bound in shallows and in miseries 
on such a full sea are we now afloat 
and we must take the current when it serves 
or lose our ventures 


cassius

then  with your will  go on 
we along ourselves  and meet them at philippi 


brutus

the deep of night is crept upon our talk 
and nature must obey necessity 
which we will niggard with a little rest 
there is no more to say 


cassius

no more  good night 
early to morrow will we rise  and hence 


brutus

lucius 
enter lucius
my gown 
exit lucius
farewell  good messala 
good night  titinius  noble  noble cassius
