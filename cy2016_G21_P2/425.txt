scene i  the plains of philippi 


enter octavius  antony  and their army


octavius

now  antony  our hopes are answered 
you said the enemy would not come down 
but keep the hills and upper regions 
it proves not so  their battles are at hand 
they mean to warn us at philippi here 
answering before we do demand of them 


antony

tut  i am in their bosoms  and i know
wherefore they do it  they could be content
to visit other places  and come down
with fearful bravery  thinking by this face
to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage 
but  not so 
enter a messenger


messenger

                  prepare you  generals 
the enemy comes on in gallant show 
their bloody sign of battle is hung out 
and something to be done immediately 


antony

octavius  lead your battle softly on 
upon the left hand of the even field 


octavius

upon the right hand i  keep thou the left 


antony

why do you cross me in this exigent 


octavius

i do not cross you  but i will do so 
march
drum  enter brutus  cassius  and their army  lucilius  titinius  messala  and others


brutus

they stand  and would have parley 


cassius

stand fast  titinius  we must out and talk 


octavius

mark antony  shall we give sign of battle 


antony

no  caesar  we will answer on their charge 
make forth  the generals would have some words 


octavius

stir not until the signal 


brutus

words before blows  is it so  countrymen 


octavius

not that we love words better  as you do 


brutus

good words are better than bad strokes  octavius 


antony

in your bad strokes  brutus  you give good words 
witness the hole you made in caesar heart 
crying  live  hail  caesar 


cassius

antony 
the posture of your blows are yet unknown 
but for your words  they rob the hybla bees 
and leave them honeyless 


antony

not stingless too 


brutus

o  yes  and soundless too 
for you have stol their buzzing  antony 
and very wisely threat before you sting 


antony

villains  you did not so  when your vile daggers
hack one another in the sides of caesar 
you show your teeth like apes  and fawn like hounds 
and bow like bondmen  kissing caesar feet 
whilst damned casca  like a cur  behind
struck caesar on the neck  o you flatterers 


cassius

flatterers  now  brutus  thank yourself 
this tongue had not offended so to day 
if cassius might have ruled 


octavius

come  come  the cause  if arguing make us sweat 
the proof of it will turn to redder drops  look 
i draw a sword against conspirators 
when think you that the sword goes up again 
never  till caesar three and thirty wounds
be well avenged  or till another caesar
have added slaughter to the sword of traitors 


brutus

caesar  thou canst not die by traitors  hands 
unless thou bring them with thee 


octavius

so i hope 
i was not born to die on brutus  sword 


brutus

o  if thou wert the noblest of thy strain 
young man  thou couldst not die more honourable 


cassius

a peevish schoolboy  worthless of such honour 
join with a masker and a reveller 


antony

old cassius still 


octavius

                  come  antony  away 
defiance  traitors  hurl we in your teeth 
if you dare fight to day  come to the field 
if not  when you have stomachs 
exeunt octavius  antony  and their army


cassius

why  now  blow wind  swell billow and swim bark 
the storm is up  and all is on the hazard 


brutus

ho  lucilius  hark  a word with you 


lucilius

 standing forth 	my lord 
brutus and lucilius converse apart


cassius

messala 


messala

 standing forth   what says my general 


cassius

messala 
this is my birth day  as this very day
was cassius born  give me thy hand  messala 
be thou my witness that against my will 
as pompey was  am i compell to set
upon one battle all our liberties 
you know that i held epicurus strong
and his opinion  now i change my mind 
and partly credit things that do presage 
coming from sardis  on our former ensign
two mighty eagles fell  and there they perch d 
gorging and feeding from our soldiers  hands 
who to philippi here consorted us 
this morning are they fled away and gone 
and in their steads do ravens  crows and kites 
fly o our heads and downward look on us 
as we were sickly prey  their shadows seem
a canopy most fatal  under which
our army lies  ready to give up the ghost 


messala

believe not so 


cassius

                  i but believe it partly 
for i am fresh of spirit and resolved
to meet all perils very constantly 


brutus

even so  lucilius 


cassius

                  now  most noble brutus 
the gods to day stand friendly  that we may 
lovers in peace  lead on our days to age 
but since the affairs of men rest still incertain 
let reason with the worst that may befall 
if we do lose this battle  then is this
the very last time we shall speak together 
what are you then determined to do 


brutus

even by the rule of that philosophy
by which i did blame cato for the death
which he did give himself  i know not how 
but i do find it cowardly and vile 
for fear of what might fall  so to prevent
the time of life  arming myself with patience
to stay the providence of some high powers
that govern us below 


cassius

then  if we lose this battle 
you are contented to be led in triumph
thorough the streets of rome 


brutus

no  cassius  no  think not  thou noble roman 
that ever brutus will go bound to rome 
he bears too great a mind  but this same day
must end that work the ides of march begun 
and whether we shall meet again i know not 
therefore our everlasting farewell take 
for ever  and for ever  farewell  cassius 
if we do meet again  why  we shall smile 
if not  why then  this parting was well made 


cassius

for ever  and for ever  farewell  brutus 
if we do meet again  we smile indeed 
if not   true this parting was well made 


brutus

why  then  lead on  o  that a man might know
the end of this day business ere it come 
but it sufficeth that the day will end 
and then the end is known  come  ho  away 
exeunt
