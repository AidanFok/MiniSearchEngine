scene iii  another part of the field 


alarums  enter cassius and titinius


cassius

o  look  titinius  look  the villains fly 
myself have to mine own turn enemy 
this ensign here of mine was turning back 
i slew the coward  and did take it from him 


titinius

o cassius  brutus gave the word too early 
who  having some advantage on octavius 
took it too eagerly  his soldiers fell to spoil 
whilst we by antony are all enclosed 
enter pindarus


pindarus

fly further off  my lord  fly further off 
mark antony is in your tents  my lord
fly  therefore  noble cassius  fly far off 


cassius

this hill is far enough  look  look  titinius 
are those my tents where i perceive the fire 


titinius

they are  my lord 


cassius

                  titinius  if thou lovest me 
mount thou my horse  and hide thy spurs in him 
till he have brought thee up to yonder troops 
and here again  that i may rest assured
whether yond troops are friend or enemy 


titinius

i will be here again  even with a thought 
exit


cassius

go  pindarus  get higher on that hill 
my sight was ever thick  regard titinius 
and tell me what thou notest about the field 
pindarus ascends the hill
this day i breathed first  time is come round 
and where i did begin  there shall i end 
my life is run his compass  sirrah  what news 


pindarus

 above   o my lord 


cassius

what news 


pindarus

 above   titinius is enclosed round about
with horsemen  that make to him on the spur 
yet he spurs on  now they are almost on him 
now  titinius  now some light  o  he lights too 
he ta en 
shout
and  hark  they shout for joy 


cassius

come down  behold no more 
o  coward that i am  to live so long 
to see my best friend ta before my face 
pindarus descends
come hither  sirrah 
in parthia did i take thee prisoner 
and then i swore thee  saving of thy life 
that whatsoever i did bid thee do 
thou shouldst attempt it  come now  keep thine oath 
now be a freeman  and with this good sword 
that ran through caesar bowels  search this bosom 
stand not to answer  here  take thou the hilts 
and  when my face is cover d  as  now 
guide thou the sword 
pindarus stabs him
caesar  thou art revenged 
even with the sword that kill thee 
dies


pindarus

so  i am free  yet would not so have been 
durst i have done my will  o cassius 
far from this country pindarus shall run 
where never roman shall take note of him 
exit
re enter titinius with messala


messala

it is but change  titinius  for octavius
is overthrown by noble brutus  power 
as cassius  legions are by antony 


titinius

these tidings will well comfort cassius 


messala

where did you leave him 


titinius

all disconsolate 
with pindarus his bondman  on this hill 


messala

is not that he t hat lies upon the ground 


titinius

he lies not like the living  o my heart 


messala

is not that he 


titinius

                  no  this was he  messala 
but cassius is no more  o setting sun 
as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night 
so in his red blood cassius  day is set 
the sun of rome is set  our day is gone 
clouds  dews  and dangers come  our deeds are done 
mistrust of my success hath done this deed 


messala

mistrust of good success hath done this deed 
o hateful error  melancholy child 
why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
the things that are not  o error  soon conceived 
thou never comest unto a happy birth 
but kill the mother that engender thee 


titinius

what  pindarus  where art thou  pindarus 


messala

seek him  titinius  whilst i go to meet
the noble brutus  thrusting this report
into his ears  i may say  thrusting it 
for piercing steel and darts envenomed
shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus
as tidings of this sight 


titinius

hie you  messala 
and i will seek for pindarus the while 
exit messala
why didst thou send me forth  brave cassius 
did i not meet thy friends  and did not they
put on my brows this wreath of victory 
and bid me give it thee  didst thou not hear their shouts 
alas  thou hast misconstrued every thing 
but  hold thee  take this garland on thy brow 
thy brutus bid me give it thee  and i
will do his bidding  brutus  come apace 
and see how i regarded caius cassius 
by your leave  gods this is a roman part
come  cassius  sword  and find titinius  heart 
kills himself
alarum  re enter messala  with brutus  cato  strato  volumnius  and lucilius


brutus

where  where  messala  doth his body lie 


messala

lo  yonder  and titinius mourning it 


brutus

titinius  face is upward 


cato

he is slain 


brutus

o julius caesar  thou art mighty yet 
thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
in our own proper entrails 
low alarums


cato

brave titinius 
look  whether he have not crown dead cassius 


brutus

are yet two romans living such as these 
the last of all the romans  fare thee well 
it is impossible that ever rome
should breed thy fellow  friends  i owe more tears
to this dead man than you shall see me pay 
i shall find time  cassius  i shall find time 
come  therefore  and to thasos send his body 
his funerals shall not be in our camp 
lest it discomfort us  lucilius  come 
and come  young cato  let us to the field 
labeo and flavius  set our battles on 
 three o clock  and  romans  yet ere night
we shall try fortune in a second fight
