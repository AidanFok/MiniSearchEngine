scene v  another part of the field 


enter brutus  dardanius  clitus  strato  and volumnius


brutus

come  poor remains of friends  rest on this rock 


clitus

statilius show the torch light  but  my lord 
he came not back  he is or ta or slain 


brutus

sit thee down  clitus  slaying is the word 
it is a deed in fashion  hark thee  clitus 
whispers


clitus

what  i  my lord  no  not for all the world 


brutus

peace then  no words 


clitus

i rather kill myself 


brutus

hark thee  dardanius 
whispers


dardanius

shall i do such a deed 


clitus

o dardanius 


dardanius

o clitus 


clitus

what ill request did brutus make to thee 


dardanius

to kill him  clitus  look  he meditates 


clitus

now is that noble vessel full of grief 
that it runs over even at his eyes 


brutus

come hither  good volumnius  list a word 


volumnius

what says my lord 


brutus

                  why  this  volumnius 
the ghost of caesar hath appear to me
two several times by night  at sardis once 
and  this last night  here in philippi fields 
i know my hour is come 


volumnius

not so  my lord 


brutus

nay  i am sure it is  volumnius 
thou seest the world  volumnius  how it goes 
our enemies have beat us to the pit 
low alarums
it is more worthy to leap in ourselves 
than tarry till they push us  good volumnius 
thou know that we two went to school together 
even for that our love of old  i prithee 
hold thou my sword hilts  whilst i run on it 


volumnius

that not an office for a friend  my lord 
alarum still


clitus

fly  fly  my lord  there is no tarrying here 


brutus

farewell to you  and you  and you  volumnius 
strato  thou hast been all this while asleep 
farewell to thee too  strato  countrymen 
my heart doth joy that yet in all my life
i found no man but he was true to me 
i shall have glory by this losing day
more than octavius and mark antony
by this vile conquest shall attain unto 
so fare you well at once  for brutus  tongue
hath almost ended his life history 
night hangs upon mine eyes  my bones would rest 
that have but labour to attain this hour 
alarum  cry within   fly  fly  fly 


clitus

fly  my lord  fly 


brutus

                  hence  i will follow 
exeunt clitus  dardanius  and volumnius
i prithee  strato  stay thou by thy lord 
thou art a fellow of a good respect 
thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it 
hold then my sword  and turn away thy face 
while i do run upon it  wilt thou  strato 


strato

give me your hand first  fare you well  my lord 


brutus

farewell  good strato 
runs on his sword
caesar  now be still 
i kill not thee with half so good a will 
dies
alarum  retreat  enter octavius  antony  messala  lucilius  and the army


octavius

what man is that 


messala

my master man  strato  where is thy master 


strato

free from the bondage you are in  messala 
the conquerors can but make a fire of him 
for brutus only overcame himself 
and no man else hath honour by his death 


lucilius

so brutus should be found  i thank thee  brutus 
that thou hast proved lucilius  saying true 


octavius

all that served brutus  i will entertain them 
fellow  wilt thou bestow thy time with me 


strato

ay  if messala will prefer me to you 


octavius

do so  good messala 


messala

how died my master  strato 


strato

i held the sword  and he did run on it 


messala

octavius  then take him to follow thee 
that did the latest service to my master 


antony

this was the noblest roman of them all 
all the conspirators save only he
did that they did in envy of great caesar 
he only  in a general honest thought
and common good to all  made one of them 
his life was gentle  and the elements
so mix in him that nature might stand up
and say to all the world  was a man 


octavius

according to his virtue let us use him 
with all respect and rites of burial 
within my tent his bones to night shall lie 
most like a soldier  order honourably 
so call the field to rest  and let away 
to part the glories of this happy day 
exeunt
