wicked and vile  and so her death concludes

the morn that i was wedded to her mother 
kneel down and take my blessing  good my girl 
wilt thou not stoop  now cursed be the time
of thy nativity  i would the milk
thy mother gave thee when thou suck her breast 
had been a little ratsbane for thy sake

i wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee 
dost thou deny thy father  cursed drab 
o  burn her  burn her  hanging is too good 
exit


york

take her away  for she hath lived too long 
to fill the world with vicious qualities 


joan la pucelle

first  let me tell you whom you have condemn d 
not me begotten of a shepherd swain 
but issued from the progeny of kings 
virtuous and holy  chosen from above 
by inspiration of celestial grace 
to work exceeding miracles on earth 
i never had to do with wicked spirits 
but you  that are polluted with your lusts 
stain with the guiltless blood of innocents 
corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices 
because you want the grace that others have 
you judge it straight a thing impossible
to compass wonders but by help of devils 
no  misconceived  joan of arc hath been
a virgin from her tender infancy 
chaste and immaculate in very thought 
whose maiden blood  thus rigorously effused 
will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven 


york

ay  ay  away with her to execution 


warwick

and hark ye  sirs  because she is a maid 
spare for no faggots  let there be enow 
place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake 
that so her torture may be shortened 


joan la pucelle

will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts 
then  joan  discover thine infirmity 
that warranteth by law to be thy privilege 
i am with child  ye bloody homicides 
murder not then the fruit within my womb 
although ye hale me to a violent death 


york

now heaven forfend  the holy maid with child 


warwick

the greatest miracle that e ye wrought 
is all your strict preciseness come to this 


york

she and the dauphin have been juggling 
i did imagine what would be her refuge 


warwick

well  go to  we have no bastards live 
especially since charles must father it 


joan la pucelle

you are deceived  my child is none of his 
it was alencon that enjoy my love 


york

alencon  that notorious machiavel 
it dies  an if it had a thousand lives 


joan la pucelle

o  give me leave  i have deluded you 
 neither charles nor yet the duke i named 
but reignier  king of naples  that prevail d 


warwick

a married man  that most intolerable 


york

why  here a girl  i think she knows not well 
there were so many  whom she may accuse 


warwick

it sign she hath been liberal and free 


york

and yet  forsooth  she is a virgin pure 
strumpet  thy words condemn thy brat and thee 
use no entreaty  for it is in vain 


joan la pucelle

then lead me hence  with whom i leave my curse 
may never glorious sun reflex his beams
upon the country where you make abode 
but darkness and the gloomy shade of death
environ you  till mischief and despair
drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves 
exit  guarded


york

break thou in pieces and consume to ashes 
thou foul accursed minister of hell 
enter cardinal of winchester  attended
cardinal


of winchester

lord regent  i do greet your excellence
with letters of commission from the king 
for know  my lords  the states of christendom 
moved with remorse of these outrageous broils 
have earnestly implored a general peace
betwixt our nation and the aspiring french 
and here at hand the dauphin and his train
approacheth  to confer about some matter 


york

 is all our travail turn to this effect 
after the slaughter of so many peers 
so many captains  gentlemen and soldiers 
that in this quarrel have been overthrown
and sold their bodies for their country benefit 
shall we at last conclude effeminate peace 
have we not lost most part of all the towns 
by treason  falsehood and by treachery 
our great progenitors had conquered 
o warwick  warwick  i foresee with grief
the utter loss of all the realm of france 


warwick

be patient  york  if we conclude a peace 
it shall be with such strict and severe covenants
as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby 
enter charles  alencon  bastard of orleans  reignier  and others


charles

since  lords of england  it is thus agreed
that peaceful truce shall be proclaim in france 
we come to be informed by yourselves
what the conditions of that league must be 


york

speak  winchester  for boiling choler chokes
the hollow passage of my poison voice 
by sight of these our baleful enemies 
cardinal


of winchester

charles  and the rest  it is enacted thus 
that  in regard king henry gives consent 
of mere compassion and of lenity 
to ease your country of distressful war 
and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace 
you shall become true liegemen to his crown 
and charles  upon condition thou wilt swear
to pay him tribute  submit thyself 
thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him 
and still enjoy thy regal dignity 


alencon

must he be then as shadow of himself 
adorn his temples with a coronet 
and yet  in substance and authority 
retain but privilege of a private man 
this proffer is absurd and reasonless 


charles

 known already that i am possess 
with more than half the gallian territories 
and therein reverenced for their lawful king 
shall i  for lucre of the rest unvanquish d 
detract so much from that prerogative 
as to be call but viceroy of the whole 
no  lord ambassador  i rather keep
that which i have than  coveting for more 
be cast from possibility of all 


york

insulting charles  hast thou by secret means
used intercession to obtain a league 
and  now the matter grows to compromise 
stand thou aloof upon comparison 
either accept the title thou usurp st 
of benefit proceeding from our king
and not of any challenge of desert 
or we will plague thee with incessant wars 


reignier

my lord  you do not well in obstinacy
to cavil in the course of this contract 
if once it be neglected  ten to one
we shall not find like opportunity 


alencon

to say the truth  it is your policy
to save your subjects from such massacre
and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
by our proceeding in hostility 
and therefore take this compact of a truce 
although you break it when your pleasure serves 


warwick

how say thou  charles  shall our condition stand 


charles

it shall 
only reserved  you claim no interest
in any of our towns of garrison 


york

then swear allegiance to his majesty 
as thou art knight  never to disobey
nor be rebellious to the crown of england 
thou  nor thy nobles  to the crown of england 
so  now dismiss your army when ye please 
hang up your ensign  let your drums be still 
for here we entertain a solemn peace
