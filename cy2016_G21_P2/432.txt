scene iii  the duke of albany palace 


enter goneril  and oswald  her steward


goneril

did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool 


oswald

yes  madam 


goneril

by day and night he wrongs me  every hour
he flashes into one gross crime or other 
that sets us all at odds  i not endure it 
his knights grow riotous  and himself upbraids us
on every trifle  when he returns from hunting 
i will not speak with him  say i am sick 
if you come slack of former services 
you shall do well  the fault of it i answer 


oswald

he coming  madam  i hear him 
horns within


goneril

put on what weary negligence you please 
you and your fellows  i have it come to question 
if he dislike it  let him to our sister 
whose mind and mine  i know  in that are one 
not to be over ruled  idle old man 
that still would manage those authorities
that he hath given away  now  by my life 
old fools are babes again  and must be used
with cheques as flatteries when they are seen abused 
remember what i tell you 


oswald

well  madam 


goneril

and let his knights have colder looks among you 
what grows of it  no matter  advise your fellows so 
i would breed from hence occasions  and i shall 
that i may speak  i write straight to my sister 
to hold my very course  prepare for dinner
