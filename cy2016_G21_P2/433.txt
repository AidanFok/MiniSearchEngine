king  thou art poor enough  what wouldst thou

he would not 


knight

my lord  i know not what the matter is  but  to my
judgment  your highness is not entertained with that
ceremonious affection as you were wont  there a
great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
general dependants as in the duke himself also and
your daughter 


king lear

ha  sayest thou so 


knight

i beseech you  pardon me  my lord  if i be mistaken 
for my duty cannot be silent when i think your
highness wronged 


king lear

thou but rememberest me of mine own conception  i
have perceived a most faint neglect of late  which i
have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity
than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness 
i will look further into t  but where my fool  i
have not seen him this two days 


knight

fool hath much pined away

dost thou call me fool  boy 


fool

all thy other titles thou hast given away  that
thou wast born with 


kent

this is not altogether fool  my lord 


fool

no  faith  lords and great men will not let me  if
i had a monopoly out  they would have part on t 
and ladies too  they will not let me have all fool
to myself  they be snatching  give me an egg 
nuncle  and i give thee two crowns 


king lear

what two crowns shall they be 


fool

why  after i have cut the egg i  the middle  and eat
up the meat  the two crowns of the egg  when thou
clovest thy crown i  the middle  and gavest away
both parts  thou borest thy ass on thy back o 
the dirt  thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown 
when thou gavest thy golden one away  if i speak
like myself in this  let him be whipped that first
finds it so 
singing
fools had ne less wit in a year 
for wise men are grown foppish 
they know not how their wits to wear 
their manners are so apish 


king lear

when were you wont to be so full of songs  sirrah 


fool

i have used it  nuncle  ever since thou madest thy
daughters thy mothers  for when thou gavest them
the rod  and put down thine own breeches 
singing
then they for sudden joy did weep 
and i for sorrow sung 
that such a king should play bo peep 
and go the fools among 
prithee  nuncle  keep a schoolmaster that can teach
thy fool to lie  i would fain learn to lie 


king lear

an you lie  sirrah  we have you whipped 


fool

i marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are 
they have me whipped for speaking true  thou 
have me whipped for lying  and sometimes i am
whipped for holding my peace  i had rather be any
kind o  thing than a fool  and yet i would not be
thee  nuncle  thou hast pared thy wit o  both sides 
and left nothing i  the middle  here comes one o 
the parings 
enter goneril


king lear

how now  daughter  what makes that frontlet on 
methinks you are too much of late i  the frown 


fool

thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to
care for her frowning  now thou art an o without a
figure  i am better than thou art now  i am a fool 
thou art nothing 
to goneril
yes  forsooth  i will hold my tongue  so your face
bids me  though you say nothing  mum  mum 
he that keeps nor crust nor crum 
weary of all  shall want some 
pointing to king lear
that a shealed peascod 


goneril

not only  sir  this your all licensed fool 
but other of your insolent retinue
do hourly carp and quarrel  breaking forth
in rank and not to be endured riots  sir 
i had thought  by making this well known unto you 
to have found a safe redress  but now grow fearful 
by what yourself too late have spoke and done 
that you protect this course  and put it on
by your allowance  which if you should  the fault
would not  censure  nor the redresses sleep 
which  in the tender of a wholesome weal 
might in their working do you that offence 
which else were shame  that then necessity
will call discreet proceeding 


fool

for  you trow  nuncle 
the hedge sparrow fed the cuckoo so long 
that it had it head bit off by it young 
so  out went the candle  and we were left darkling 


king lear

are you our daughter 


goneril

come  sir 
i would you would make use of that good wisdom 
whereof i know you are fraught  and put away
these dispositions  that of late transform you
from what you rightly are 


fool

may not an ass know when the cart
draws the horse  whoop  jug  i love thee 


king lear

doth any here know me  this is not lear 
doth lear walk thus  speak thus  where are his eyes 
either his notion weakens  his discernings
are lethargied ha  waking   not so 
who is it that can tell me who i am 


fool

lear shadow 


king lear

i would learn that  for  by the
marks of sovereignty  knowledge  and reason 
i should be false persuaded i had daughters 


fool

which they will make an obedient father 


king lear

your name  fair gentlewoman 


goneril

this admiration  sir  is much o  the savour
of other your new pranks  i do beseech you
to understand my purposes aright 
as you are old and reverend  you should be wise 
here do you keep a hundred knights and squires 
men so disorder d  so debosh and bold 
that this our court  infected with their manners 
shows like a riotous inn  epicurism and lust
make it more like a tavern or a brothel
than a graced palace  the shame itself doth speak
for instant remedy  be then desired
by her  that else will take the thing she begs 
a little to disquantity your train 
and the remainder  that shall still depend 
to be such men as may besort your age 
and know themselves and you 


king lear

darkness and devils 
saddle my horses  call my train together 
degenerate bastard  i not trouble thee 
yet have i left a daughter

make servants of their betters 
enter albany


king lear

woe  that too late repents 
to albany
o  sir  are you come 
is it your will  speak  sir  prepare my horses 
ingratitude  thou marble hearted fiend 
more hideous when thou show thee in a child
than the sea monster 


albany

pray  sir  be patient 


king lear

 to goneril   detested kite  thou liest 
my train are men of choice and rarest parts 
that all particulars of duty know 
and in the most exact regard support
the worships of their name  o most small fault 
how ugly didst thou in cordelia show 
that  like an engine  wrench my frame of nature
from the fix place  drew from heart all love 
and added to the gall  o lear  lear  lear 
beat at this gate  that let thy folly in 
striking his head
and thy dear judgment out  go  go  my people 


albany

my lord  i am guiltless  as i am ignorant
of what hath moved you 


king lear

it may be so  my lord 
hear  nature  hear  dear goddess  hear 
suspend thy purpose  if thou didst intend
to make this creature fruitful 
into her womb convey sterility 
dry up in her the organs of increase 
and from her derogate body never spring
a babe to honour her  if she must teem 
create her child of spleen  that it may live 
and be a thwart disnatured torment to her 
let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth 
with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks 
turn all her mother pains and benefits
to laughter and contempt  that she may feel
how sharper than a serpent tooth it is
to have a thankless child  away  away 
exit


albany

now  gods that we adore  whereof comes this 


goneril

never afflict yourself to know the cause 
but let his disposition have that scope
that dotage gives it 
re enter king lear

within a fortnight 


albany

what the matter  sir 


king lear

i tell thee 
to goneril
life and death  i am ashamed
that thou hast power to shake my manhood thus 
that these hot tears  which break from me perforce 
should make thee worth them  blasts and fogs upon thee 
the untented woundings of a father curse
pierce every sense about thee  old fond eyes 
beweep this cause again  i pluck ye out 
and cast you  with the waters that you lose 
to temper clay  yea  it is come to this 
let is be so  yet have i left a daughter 
who  i am sure  is kind and comfortable 
when she shall hear this of thee  with her nails
she flay thy wolvish visage  thou shalt find
that i resume the shape which thou dost think
i have cast off for ever  thou shalt 
i warrant thee 
exeunt king lear  kent  and attendants


goneril

do you mark that  my lord 


albany

i cannot be so partial  goneril 
to the great love i bear you 


goneril

pray you  content  what  oswald  ho

nuncle lear  nuncle lear  tarry and take the fool
with thee 
a fox  when one has caught her 
and such a daughter 
should sure to the slaughter 
if my cap would buy a halter 
so the fool follows after 
exit


goneril

this man hath had good counsel a hundred knights 
 politic and safe to let him keep
at point a hundred knights  yes  that  on every dream 
each buzz  each fancy  each complaint  dislike 
he may enguard his dotage with their powers 
and hold our lives in mercy  oswald  i say 


albany

well  you may fear too far 


goneril

safer than trust too far 
let me still take away the harms i fear 
not fear still to be taken  i know his heart 
what he hath utter i have writ my sister
if she sustain him and his hundred knights
when i have show the unfitness 
re enter oswald
how now  oswald 
what  have you writ that letter to my sister 


oswald

yes  madam 


goneril

take you some company  and away to horse 
inform her full of my particular fear 
and thereto add such reasons of your own
as may compact it more  get you gone 
and hasten your return 
exit oswald
no  no  my lord 
this milky gentleness and course of yours
though i condemn not  yet  under pardon 
you are much more attask for want of wisdom
than praised for harmful mildness 


albany

how far your eyes may pierce i can not tell 
striving to better  oft we mar what well 


goneril

nay  then 


albany

well  well  the event
