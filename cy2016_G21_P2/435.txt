i mean the whispered ones  for they are yet but
ear kissing arguments 


edmund

which i must act  briefness and fortune  work 
brother  a word  descend  brother  i say

and regan with him  have you nothing said
upon his party  the duke of albany

                  i am sure on t  not a word 


edmund

i hear my father coming  pardon me 
in cunning i must draw my sword upon you
draw  seem to defend yourself  now quit you well 
yield  come before my father  light  ho  here 
fly  brother  torches  torches  so  farewell 
exit edgar
some blood drawn on me would beget opinion 
wounds his arm
of my more fierce endeavour  i have seen drunkards
do more than this in sport  father  father 
stop  stop  no help 
enter gloucester  and servants with torches


gloucester

now  edmund  where the villain 


edmund

here stood he in the dark  his sharp sword out 
mumbling of wicked charms  conjuring the moon
to stand auspicious mistress 


gloucester

but where is he 


edmund

look  sir  i bleed 


gloucester

where is the villain  edmund 


edmund

fled this way  sir  when by no means he could 


gloucester

pursue him  ho  go after 
exeunt some servants
by no means what 


edmund

persuade me to the murder of your lordship 
but that i told him  the revenging gods
 parricides did all their thunders bend 
spoke  with how manifold and strong a bond
the child was bound to the father  sir  in fine 
seeing how loathly opposite i stood
to his unnatural purpose  in fell motion 
with his prepared sword  he charges home
my unprovided body  lanced mine arm 
but when he saw my best alarum spirits 
bold in the quarrel right  roused to the encounter 
or whether gasted by the noise i made 
full suddenly he fled 


gloucester

let him fly far 
not in this land shall he remain uncaught 
and found dispatch  the noble duke my master 
my worthy arch and patron  comes to night 
by his authority i will proclaim it 
that he which finds him shall deserve our thanks 
bringing the murderous coward to the stake 
he that conceals him  death 


edmund

when i dissuaded him from his intent 
and found him pight to do it  with curst speech
i threaten to discover him  he replied 
 unpossessing bastard  dost thou think 
if i would stand against thee  would the reposal
of any trust  virtue  or worth in thee
make thy words faith d  no  what i should deny 
as this i would  ay  though thou didst produce
my very character i turn it all
to thy suggestion  plot  and damned practise 
and thou must make a dullard of the world 
if they not thought the profits of my death
were very pregnant and potential spurs
to make thee seek it 


gloucester

strong and fasten villain
would he deny his letter  i never got him 
tucket within
hark  the duke trumpets  i know not why he comes 
all ports i bar  the villain shall not  scape 
the duke must grant me that  besides  his picture
i will send far and near  that all the kingdom
may have the due note of him  and of my land 
loyal and natural boy  i work the means
to make thee capable 
enter cornwall  regan  and attendants


cornwall

how now  my noble friend  since i came hither 
which i can call but now  i have heard strange news 


regan

if it be true  all vengeance comes too short
which can pursue the offender  how dost  my lord 


gloucester

o  madam  my old heart is crack d  it crack d 


regan

what  did my father godson seek your life 
he whom my father named  your edgar 


gloucester

o  lady  lady  shame would have it hid 


regan

was he not companion with the riotous knights
that tend upon my father 


gloucester

i know not  madam   too bad  too bad 


edmund

yes  madam  he was of that consort 


regan

no marvel  then  though he were ill affected 
 they have put him on the old man death 
to have the expense and waste of his revenues 
i have this present evening from my sister
been well inform of them  and with such cautions 
that if they come to sojourn at my house 
i not be there 


cornwall

nor i  assure thee  regan 
edmund  i hear that you have shown your father
a child like office 


edmund

 my duty  sir 


gloucester

he did bewray his practise  and received
this hurt you see  striving to apprehend him 


cornwall

is he pursued 


gloucester

                  ay  my good lord 


cornwall

if he be taken  he shall never more
be fear of doing harm  make your own purpose 
how in my strength you please  for you  edmund 
whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
so much commend itself  you shall be ours 
natures of such deep trust we shall much need 
you we first seize on 


edmund

i shall serve you  sir 
truly  however else 


gloucester

for him i thank your grace 


cornwall

you know not why we came to visit you 


regan

thus out of season  threading dark eyed night 
occasions  noble gloucester  of some poise 
wherein we must have use of your advice 
our father he hath writ  so hath our sister 
of differences  which i least thought it fit
to answer from our home  the several messengers
from hence attend dispatch  our good old friend 
lay comforts to your bosom  and bestow
your needful counsel to our business 
which craves the instant use 


gloucester

i serve you  madam 
your graces are right welcome 
exeunt
