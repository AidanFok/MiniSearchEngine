cornwall

what is your difference  speak 


oswald

i am scarce in breath  my lord 


kent

no marvel  you have so bestirred your valour  you
cowardly rascal  nature disclaims in thee  a
tailor made thee 


cornwall

thou art a strange fellow  a tailor make a man 


kent

ay  a tailor  sir  a stone cutter or painter could
not have made him so ill  though he had been but two
hours at the trade 


cornwall

speak yet  how grew your quarrel 


oswald

this ancient ruffian  sir  whose life i have spared
at suit of his gray beard 


kent

thou whoreson zed  thou unnecessary letter  my
lord  if you will give me leave  i will tread this
unbolted villain into mortar  and daub the wall of
a jakes with him  spare my gray beard  you wagtail 


cornwall

peace  sirrah 
you beastly knave  know you no reverence 


kent

yes  sir  but anger hath a privilege 


cornwall

why art thou angry 


kent

that such a slave as this should wear a sword 
who wears no honesty  such smiling rogues as these 
like rats  oft bite the holy cords a twain
which are too intrinse t  unloose  smooth every passion
that in the natures of their lords rebel 
bring oil to fire  snow to their colder moods 
renege  affirm  and turn their halcyon beaks
with every gale and vary of their masters 
knowing nought  like dogs  but following 
a plague upon your epileptic visage 
smile you my speeches  as i were a fool 
goose  if i had you upon sarum plain 
i drive ye cackling home to camelot 


cornwall

why  art thou mad  old fellow 


gloucester

how fell you out  say that 


kent

no contraries hold more antipathy
than i and such a knave 


cornwall

why dost thou call him a knave   what his offence 


kent

his countenance likes me not 


cornwall

no more  perchance  does mine  nor his  nor hers 


kent

sir   my occupation to be plain 
i have seen better faces in my time
than stands on any shoulder that i see
before me at this instant 


cornwall

this is some fellow 
who  having been praised for bluntness  doth affect
a saucy roughness  and constrains the garb
quite from his nature  he cannot flatter  he 
an honest mind and plain  he must speak truth 
an they will take it  so  if not  he plain 
these kind of knaves i know  which in this plainness
harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
than twenty silly ducking observants
that stretch their duties nicely 


kent

sir  in good sooth  in sincere verity 
under the allowance of your great aspect 
whose influence  like the wreath of radiant fire
on flickering phoebus  front 


cornwall

what mean by this 


kent

to go out of my dialect  which you
discommend so much  i know  sir  i am no
flatterer  he that beguiled you in a plain
accent was a plain knave  which for my part
i will not be  though i should win your displeasure
to entreat me to  t 


cornwall

what was the offence you gave him 


oswald

i never gave him any 
it pleased the king his master very late
to strike at me  upon his misconstruction 
when he  conjunct and flattering his displeasure 
tripp me behind  being down  insulted  rail d 
and put upon him such a deal of man 
that worthied him  got praises of the king
for him attempting who was self subdued 
and  in the fleshment of this dread exploit 
drew on me here again 


kent

none of these rogues and cowards
but ajax is their fool 


cornwall

fetch forth the stocks 
you stubborn ancient knave  you reverend braggart 
we teach you 


kent

                  sir  i am too old to learn 
call not your stocks for me  i serve the king 
on whose employment i was sent to you 
you shall do small respect  show too bold malice
against the grace and person of my master 
stocking his messenger 


cornwall

fetch forth the stocks  as i have life and honour 
there shall he sit till noon 


regan

till noon  till night  my lord  and all night too 


kent

why  madam  if i were your father dog 
you should not use me so 


regan

sir  being his knave  i will 


cornwall

this is a fellow of the self same colour
our sister speaks of  come  bring away the stocks 
stocks brought out


gloucester

let me beseech your grace not to do so 
his fault is much  and the good king his master
will cheque him for  t  your purposed low correction
is such as basest and contemned wretches
for pilferings and most common trespasses
are punish with  the king must take it ill 
that he so slightly valued in his messenger 
should have him thus restrain d 


cornwall

i answer that 


regan

my sister may receive it much more worse 
to have her gentleman abused  assaulted 
for following her affairs  put in his legs 
kent is put in the stocks
come  my good lord  away 
exeunt all but gloucester and kent


gloucester

i am sorry for thee  friend   the duke pleasure 
whose disposition  all the world well knows 
will not be rubb nor stopp d  i entreat for thee 


kent

pray  do not  sir  i have watched and travell hard 
some time i shall sleep out  the rest i whistle 
a good man fortune may grow out at heels 
give you good morrow 


gloucester

the duke to blame in this   be ill taken 
exit


kent

good king  that must approve the common saw 
thou out of heaven benediction comest
to the warm sun 
approach  thou beacon to this under globe 
that by thy comfortable beams i may
peruse this letter  nothing almost sees miracles
but misery  i know  from cordelia 
who hath most fortunately been inform 
of my obscured course  and shall find time
from this enormous state  seeking to give
losses their remedies  all weary and o erwatch d 
take vantage  heavy eyes  not to behold
this shameful lodging 
fortune  good night  smile once more  turn thy wheel 
sleeps
