edgar

i heard myself proclaim d 
and by the happy hollow of a tree
escaped the hunt  no port is free  no place 
that guard  and most unusual vigilance 
does not attend my taking  whiles i may  scape 
i will preserve myself  and am bethought
to take the basest and most poorest shape
that ever penury  in contempt of man 
brought near to beast  my face i grime with filth 
blanket my loins  elf all my hair in knots 
and with presented nakedness out face
the winds and persecutions of the sky 
the country gives me proof and precedent
of bedlam beggars  who  with roaring voices 
strike in their numb and mortified bare arms
pins  wooden pricks  nails  sprigs of rosemary 
and with this horrible object  from low farms 
poor pelting villages  sheep cotes  and mills 
sometime with lunatic bans  sometime with prayers 
enforce their charity  poor turlygod  poor tom 
that something yet  edgar i nothing am
