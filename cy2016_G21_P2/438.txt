by the heads  dogs and bears by the neck  monkeys by
the loins  and men by the legs  when a man

nether stocks

to set thee here

thou mightst deserve  or they impose  this usage 
coming from us 


kent

                  my lord  when at their home
i did commend your highness  letters to them 
ere i was risen from the place that show 
my duty kneeling  came there a reeking post 
stew in his haste  half breathless  panting forth
from goneril his mistress salutations 
deliver letters  spite of intermission 
which presently they read  on whose contents 
they summon up their meiny  straight took horse 
commanded me to follow  and attend
the leisure of their answer  gave me cold looks 
and meeting here the other messenger 
whose welcome  i perceived  had poison mine 
being the very fellow that of late
display so saucily against your highness 
having more man than wit about me  drew 
he raised the house with loud and coward cries 
your son and daughter found this trespass worth
the shame which here it suffers 


fool

winter not gone yet  if the wild geese fly that way 
fathers that wear rags
do make their children blind 
but fathers that bear bags
shall see their children kind 
fortune  that arrant whore 
ne turns the key to the poor 
but  for all this  thou shalt have as many dolours
for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year 


king lear

o  how this mother swells up toward my heart 
hysterica passio  down  thou climbing sorrow 
thy element below  where is this daughter

follow me not 
stay here

none 
how chance the king comes with so small a train 


fool

and thou hadst been set i  the stocks for that
question  thou hadst well deserved it 


kent

why  fool 


fool

we set thee to school to an ant  to teach thee
there no labouring i  the winter  all that follow
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men  and
there not a nose among twenty but can smell him
that stinking  let go thy hold when a great wheel
runs down a hill  lest it break thy neck with
following it  but the great one that goes up the
hill  let him draw thee after  when a wise man
gives thee better counsel  give me mine again  i
would have none but knaves follow it  since a fool gives it 
that sir which serves and seeks for gain 
and follows but for form 
will pack when it begins to rain 
and leave thee in the storm 
but i will tarry  the fool will stay 
and let the wise man fly 
the knave turns fool that runs away 
the fool no knave  perdy

thee o to harshness  her eyes are fierce  but thine
do comfort and not burn   not in thee
to grudge my pleasures  to cut off my train 
to bandy hasty words  to scant my sizes 
and in conclusion to oppose the bolt
against my coming in  thou better know 
the offices of nature  bond of childhood 
effects of courtesy  dues of gratitude 
thy half o  the kingdom hast thou not forgot 
wherein i thee endow d 


regan

good sir  to the purpose

who put my man i  the stocks 
tucket within

i know t  my sister s  this approves her letter 
that she would soon be here 
enter oswald
is your lady come

this is a slave  whose easy borrow pride
dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows 
out  varlet  from my sight 


cornwall

what means your grace 


king lear

who stock my servant  regan  i have good hope
thou didst not know on t  who comes here  o heavens 
enter goneril
if you do love old men  if your sweet sway
allow obedience  if yourselves are old 
make it your cause  send down  and take my part 
to goneril
art not ashamed to look upon this beard 
o regan  wilt thou take her by the hand 


goneril

why not by the hand  sir  how have i offended 
all not offence that indiscretion finds
and dotage terms so 


king lear

o sides  you are too tough 
will you yet hold  how came my man i  the stocks 


cornwall

i set him there  sir  but his own disorders
deserved much less advancement 


king lear

you  did you 


regan

i pray you  father  being weak  seem so 
if  till the expiration of your month 
you will return and sojourn with my sister 
dismissing half your train  come then to me 
i am now from home  and out of that provision
which shall be needful for your entertainment 


king lear

return to her  and fifty men dismiss d 
no  rather i abjure all roofs  and choose
to wage against the enmity o  the air 
to be a comrade with the wolf and owl 
necessity sharp pinch  return with her 
why  the hot blooded france  that dowerless took
our youngest born  i could as well be brought
to knee his throne  and  squire like  pension beg
to keep base life afoot  return with her 
persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
to this detested groom 
pointing at oswald


goneril

at your choice  sir 


king lear

i prithee  daughter  do not make me mad 
i will not trouble thee  my child  farewell 
we no more meet  no more see one another 
but yet thou art my flesh  my blood  my daughter 
or rather a disease that in my flesh 
which i must needs call mine  thou art a boil 
a plague sore  an embossed carbuncle 
in my corrupted blood  but i not chide thee 
let shame come when it will  i do not call it 
i do not bid the thunder bearer shoot 
nor tell tales of thee to high judging jove 
mend when thou canst  be better at thy leisure 
i can be patient  i can stay with regan 
i and my hundred knights 


regan

not altogether so 
i look not for you yet  nor am provided
for your fit welcome  give ear  sir  to my sister 
for those that mingle reason with your passion
must be content to think you old  and so 
but she knows what she does 


king lear

is this well spoken 


regan

i dare avouch it  sir  what  fifty followers 
is it not well  what should you need of more 
yea  or so many  sith that both charge and danger
speak  so great a number  how  in one house 
should many people  under two commands 
hold amity   hard  almost impossible 


goneril

why might not you  my lord  receive attendance
from those that she calls servants or from mine 


regan

why not  my lord  if then they chanced to slack you 
we could control them  if you will come to me 
for now i spy a danger i entreat you
to bring but five and twenty  to no more
will i give place or notice 


king lear

i gave you all 


regan

                  and in good time you gave it 


king lear

made you my guardians  my depositaries 
but kept a reservation to be follow 
with such a number  what  must i come to you
with five and twenty  regan  said you so 


regan

and speak again  my lord  no more with me 


king lear

those wicked creatures yet do look well favour d 
when others are more wicked  not being the worst
stands in some rank of praise 
to goneril
i go with thee 
thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty 
and thou art twice her love 


goneril

hear me  my lord 
what need you five and twenty  ten  or five 
to follow in a house where twice so many
have a command to tend you 


regan

what need one 


king lear

o  reason not the need  our basest beggars
are in the poorest thing superfluous 
allow not nature more than nature needs 
man life as cheap as beast s  thou art a lady 
if only to go warm were gorgeous 
why  nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear st 
which scarcely keeps thee warm  but  for true need 
you heavens  give me that patience  patience i need 
you see me here  you gods  a poor old man 
as full of grief as age  wretched in both 
if it be you that stir these daughters  hearts
against their father  fool me not so much
to bear it tamely  touch me with noble anger 
and let not women weapons  water drops 
stain my man cheeks  no  you unnatural hags 
i will have such revenges on you both 
that all the world shall i will do such things 
what they are  yet i know not  but they shall be
the terrors of the earth  you think i weep
no  i not weep 
i have full cause of weeping  but this heart
shall break into a hundred thousand flaws 
or ere i weep  o fool  i shall go mad 
exeunt king lear  gloucester  kent  and fool
storm and tempest

this house is little  the old man and his people
cannot be well bestow d 


goneril

 his own blame  hath put himself from rest 
and must needs taste his folly 


regan

for his particular  i receive him gladly 
but not one follower 


goneril

so am i purposed 
where is my lord of gloucester

re enter gloucester

the king is in high rage 


cornwall

whither is he going

he calls to horse  but will i know not whither 


cornwall

 best to give him way  he leads himself 


goneril

my lord  entreat him by no means to stay 


gloucester

alack  the night comes on  and the bleak winds
do sorely ruffle  for many miles a bout
there scarce a bush 


regan

o  sir  to wilful men 
the injuries that they themselves procure
must be their schoolmasters  shut up your doors 
he is attended with a desperate train 
and what they may incense him to  being apt
to have his ear abused  wisdom bids fear

shut up your doors  my lord   a wild night 
my regan counsels well  come out o  the storm
