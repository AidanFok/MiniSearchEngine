scene i  a heath 


storm still  enter kent and a gentleman  meeting


kent

who there  besides foul weather 


gentleman

one minded like the weather  most unquietly 


kent

i know you  where the king 


gentleman

contending with the fretful element 
bids the winds blow the earth into the sea 
or swell the curled water  the main 
that things might change or cease  tears his white hair 
which the impetuous blasts  with eyeless rage 
catch in their fury  and make nothing of 
strives in his little world of man to out scorn
the to and fro conflicting wind and rain 
this night  wherein the cub drawn bear would couch 
the lion and the belly pinched wolf
keep their fur dry  unbonneted he runs 
and bids what will take all 


kent

but who is with him 


gentleman

none but the fool  who labours to out jest
his heart struck injuries 


kent

sir  i do know you 
and dare  upon the warrant of my note 
commend a dear thing to you  there is division 
although as yet the face of it be cover 
with mutual cunning   albany and cornwall 
who have as who have not  that their great stars
throned and set high servants  who seem no less 
which are to france the spies and speculations
intelligent of our state  what hath been seen 
either in snuffs and packings of the dukes 
or the hard rein which both of them have borne
against the old kind king  or something deeper 
whereof perchance these are but furnishings 
but  true it is  from france there comes a power
into this scatter kingdom  who already 
wise in our negligence  have secret feet
in some of our best ports  and are at point
to show their open banner  now to you 
if on my credit you dare build so far
to make your speed to dover  you shall find
some that will thank you  making just report
of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
the king hath cause to plain 
i am a gentleman of blood and breeding 
and  from some knowledge and assurance  offer
this office to you 


gentleman

i will talk further with you 


kent

no  do not 
for confirmation that i am much more
than my out wall  open this purse  and take
what it contains  if you shall see cordelia 
as fear not but you shall show her this ring 
and she will tell you who your fellow is
that yet you do not know  fie on this storm 
i will go seek the king 


gentleman

give me your hand  have you no more to say 


kent

few words  but  to effect  more than all yet 
that  when we have found the king in which your pain
that way  i this he that first lights on him
holla the other 
exeunt severally
