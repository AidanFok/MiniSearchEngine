scene iii  gloucester castle 


enter gloucester and edmund


gloucester

alack  alack  edmund  i like not this unnatural
dealing  when i desire their leave that i might
pity him  they took from me the use of mine own
house  charged me  on pain of their perpetual
displeasure  neither to speak of him  entreat for
him  nor any way sustain him 


edmund

most savage and unnatural 


gloucester

go to  say you nothing  there a division betwixt
the dukes  and a worse matter than that  i have
received a letter this night   dangerous to be
spoken  i have locked the letter in my closet 
these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
home  there part of a power already footed  we
must incline to the king  i will seek him  and
privily relieve him  go you and maintain talk with
the duke  that my charity be not of him perceived 
if he ask for me  i am ill  and gone to bed 
though i die for it  as no less is threatened me 
the king my old master must be relieved  there is
some strange thing toward  edmund  pray you  be careful 
exit


edmund

this courtesy  forbid thee  shall the duke
instantly know  and of that letter too 
this seems a fair deserving  and must draw me
that which my father loses  no less than all 
the younger rises when the old doth fall 
exit
