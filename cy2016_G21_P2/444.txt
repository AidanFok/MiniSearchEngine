edgar

when we our betters see bearing our woes 
we scarcely think our miseries our foes 
who alone suffers suffers most i  the mind 
leaving free things and happy shows behind 
but then the mind much sufferance doth o skip 
when grief hath mates  and bearing fellowship 
how light and portable my pain seems now 
when that which makes me bend makes the king bow 
he childed as i father d  tom  away 
mark the high noises  and thyself bewray 
when false opinion  whose wrong thought defiles thee 
in thy just proof  repeals and reconciles thee 
what will hap more to night  safe  the king 
lurk  lurk 
exit
