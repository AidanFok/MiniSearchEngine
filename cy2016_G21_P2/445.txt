which came from one that of a neutral heart

and false 


cornwall

where hast thou sent the king

wherefore to dover  let him first answer that 


gloucester

i am tied to the stake  and i must stand the course 


regan

wherefore to dover  sir 


gloucester

because i would not see thy cruel nails
pluck out his poor old eyes  nor thy fierce sister
in his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs 
the sea  with such a storm as his bare head
in hell black night endured  would have buoy up 
and quench the stelled fires 
yet  poor old heart  he holp the heavens to rain 
if wolves had at thy gate howl that stern time 
thou shouldst have said  porter  turn the key 
all cruels else subscribed  but i shall see
the winged vengeance overtake such children 


cornwall

see shalt thou never  fellows  hold the chair 
upon these eyes of thine i set my foot 


gloucester

he that will think to live till he be old 
give me some help  o cruel  o you gods

that made the overture of thy treasons to us 
who is too good to pity thee 


gloucester
