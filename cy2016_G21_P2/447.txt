oswald

madam  within  but never man so changed 
i told him of the army that was landed 
he smiled at it  i told him you were coming 
his answer was  worse  of gloucester treachery 
and of the loyal service of his son 
when i inform him  then he call me sot 
and told me i had turn the wrong side out 
what most he should dislike seems pleasant to him 
what like  offensive 


goneril

that dares not undertake  he not feel wrongs
which tie him to an answer  our wishes on the way
may prove effects  back  edmund  to my brother 
hasten his musters and conduct his powers 
i must change arms at home  and give the distaff
into my husband hands  this trusty servant
shall pass between us  ere long you are like to hear 
if you dare venture in your own behalf 
a mistress command  wear this  spare speech 
giving a favour
decline your head  this kiss  if it durst speak 
would stretch thy spirits up into the air 
conceive  and fare thee well 


edmund

yours in the ranks of death 


goneril

my most dear gloucester

exit
enter albany


goneril

i have been worth the whistle 


albany

o goneril 
you are not worth the dust which the rude wind
blows in your face  i fear your disposition 
that nature  which contemns its origin 
cannot be border certain in itself 
she that herself will sliver and disbranch
from her material sap  perforce must wither
and come to deadly use 


goneril

no more  the text is foolish 


albany

wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile 
filths savour but themselves  what have you done 
tigers  not daughters  what have you perform d 
a father  and a gracious aged man 
whose reverence even the head lugg bear would lick 
most barbarous  most degenerate  have you madded 
could my good brother suffer you to do it 
a man  a prince  by him so benefited 
if that the heavens do not their visible spirits
send quickly down to tame these vile offences 
it will come 
humanity must perforce prey on itself 
like monsters of the deep 


goneril

milk liver man 
that bear a cheek for blows  a head for wrongs 
who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
thine honour from thy suffering  that not know 
fools do those villains pity who are punish 
ere they have done their mischief  where thy drum 
france spreads his banners in our noiseless land 
with plumed helm thy slayer begins threats 
whiles thou  a moral fool  sit still  and criest
 alack  why does he so 


albany

see thyself  devil 
proper deformity seems not in the fiend
so horrid as in woman 


goneril

o vain fool 


albany

thou changed and self cover thing  for shame 
be monster not thy feature  were my fitness
to let these hands obey my blood 
they are apt enough to dislocate and tear
thy flesh and bones  howe thou art a fiend 
a woman shape doth shield thee 


goneril

marry  your manhood now 
enter a messenger


albany

messenger

a servant that he bred  thrill with remorse 
opposed against the act  bending his sword
to his great master  who  thereat enraged 
flew on him  and amongst them fell him dead 
but not without that harmful stroke  which since
hath pluck him after 


albany
