scene iii  the french camp near dover 


enter kent and a gentleman


kent

why the king of france is so suddenly gone back
know you the reason 


gentleman

something he left imperfect in the
state  which since his coming forth is thought
of  which imports to the kingdom so much
fear and danger  that his personal return was
most required and necessary 


kent

who hath he left behind him general 


gentleman

the marshal of france  monsieur la far 


kent

did your letters pierce the queen to any
demonstration of grief 


gentleman

ay  sir  she took them  read them in my presence 
and now and then an ample tear trill down
her delicate cheek  it seem she was a queen
over her passion  who  most rebel like 
sought to be king o her 


kent

o  then it moved her 


gentleman

not to a rage  patience and sorrow strove
who should express her goodliest  you have seen
sunshine and rain at once  her smiles and tears
were like a better way  those happy smilets 
that play on her ripe lip  seem not to know
what guests were in her eyes  which parted thence 
as pearls from diamonds dropp d  in brief 
sorrow would be a rarity most beloved 
if all could so become it 


kent

made she no verbal question 


gentleman

 faith  once or twice she heaved the name of  father 
pantingly forth  as if it press her heart 
cried  sisters  sisters  shame of ladies  sisters 
kent  father  sisters  what  i  the storm  i  the night 
let pity not be believed  there she shook
the holy water from her heavenly eyes 
and clamour moisten d  then away she started
to deal with grief alone 


kent

it is the stars 
the stars above us  govern our conditions 
else one self mate and mate could not beget
such different issues  you spoke not with her since 


gentleman

no 


kent

was this before the king return d 


gentleman

no  since 


kent

well  sir  the poor distressed lear i  the town 
who sometime  in his better tune  remembers
what we are come about  and by no means
will yield to see his daughter 


gentleman

why  good sir 


kent

a sovereign shame so elbows him  his own unkindness 
that stripp her from his benediction  turn her
to foreign casualties  gave her dear rights
to his dog hearted daughters  these things sting
his mind so venomously  that burning shame
detains him from cordelia 


gentleman

alack  poor gentleman 


kent

of albany and cornwall powers you heard not 


gentleman

 so  they are afoot 


kent

well  sir  i bring you to our master lear 
and leave you to attend him  some dear cause
will in concealment wrap me up awhile 
when i am known aright  you shall not grieve
lending me this acquaintance  i pray you  go
along with me
