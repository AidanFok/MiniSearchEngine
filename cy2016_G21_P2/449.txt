scene iv  the same  a tent 


enter  with drum and colours  cordelia  doctor  and soldiers


cordelia

alack   he  why  he was met even now
as mad as the vex sea  singing aloud 
crown with rank fumiter and furrow weeds 
with bur docks  hemlock  nettles  cuckoo flowers 
darnel  and all the idle weeds that grow
in our sustaining corn  a century send forth 
search every acre in the high grown field 
and bring him to our eye 
exit an officer
what can man wisdom
in the restoring his bereaved sense 
he that helps him take all my outward worth 


doctor

there is means  madam 
our foster nurse of nature is repose 
the which he lacks  that to provoke in him 
are many simples operative  whose power
will close the eye of anguish 


cordelia

all blest secrets 
all you unpublish virtues of the earth 
spring with my tears  be aidant and remediate
in the good man distress  seek  seek for him 
lest his ungovern rage dissolve the life
that wants the means to lead it 
enter a messenger


messenger

news  madam 
the british powers are marching hitherward 


cordelia

 known before  our preparation stands
in expectation of them  o dear father 
it is thy business that i go about 
therefore great france
my mourning and important tears hath pitied 
no blown ambition doth our arms incite 
but love  dear love  and our aged father right 
soon may i hear and see him 
exeunt
