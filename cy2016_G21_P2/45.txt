warkworth  before the castle


enter rumour  painted full of tongues


rumour

open your ears  for which of you will stop
the vent of hearing when loud rumour speaks 
i  from the orient to the drooping west 
making the wind my post horse  still unfold
the acts commenced on this ball of earth 
upon my tongues continual slanders ride 
the which in every language i pronounce 
stuffing the ears of men with false reports 
i speak of peace  while covert enmity
under the smile of safety wounds the world 
and who but rumour  who but only i 
make fearful musters and prepared defence 
whiles the big year  swoln with some other grief 
is thought with child by the stern tyrant war 
and no such matter  rumour is a pipe
blown by surmises  jealousies  conjectures
and of so easy and so plain a stop
that the blunt monster with uncounted heads 
the still discordant wavering multitude 
can play upon it  but what need i thus
my well known body to anatomize
among my household  why is rumour here 
i run before king harry victory 
who in a bloody field by shrewsbury
hath beaten down young hotspur and his troops 
quenching the flame of bold rebellion
even with the rebel blood  but what mean i
to speak so true at first  my office is
to noise abroad that harry monmouth fell
under the wrath of noble hotspur sword 
and that the king before the douglas  rage
stoop his anointed head as low as death 
this have i rumour through the peasant towns
between that royal field of shrewsbury
and this worm eaten hold of ragged stone 
where hotspur father  old northumberland 
lies crafty sick  the posts come tiring on 
and not a man of them brings other news
than they have learn of me  from rumour tongues
they bring smooth comforts false  worse than
true wrongs
