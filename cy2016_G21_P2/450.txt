scene v  gloucester castle 


enter regan and oswald


regan

but are my brother powers set forth 


oswald

ay  madam 


regan

himself in person there 


oswald

madam  with much ado 
your sister is the better soldier 


regan

lord edmund spake not with your lord at home 


oswald

no  madam 


regan

what might import my sister letter to him 


oswald

i know not  lady 


regan

 faith  he is posted hence on serious matter 
it was great ignorance  gloucester eyes being out 
to let him live  where he arrives he moves
all hearts against us  edmund  i think  is gone 
in pity of his misery  to dispatch
his nighted life  moreover  to descry
the strength o  the enemy 


oswald

i must needs after him  madam  with my letter 


regan

our troops set forth to morrow  stay with us 
the ways are dangerous 


oswald

i may not  madam 
my lady charged my duty in this business 


regan

why should she write to edmund  might not you
transport her purposes by word  belike 
something i know not what  i love thee much 
let me unseal the letter 


oswald

madam  i had rather 


regan

i know your lady does not love her husband 
i am sure of that  and at her late being here
she gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
to noble edmund  i know you are of her bosom 


oswald

i  madam 


regan

i speak in understanding  you are  i know t 
therefore i do advise you  take this note 
my lord is dead  edmund and i have talk d 
and more convenient is he for my hand
than for your lady s  you may gather more 
if you do find him  pray you  give him this 
and when your mistress hears thus much from you 
i pray  desire her call her wisdom to her 
so  fare you well 
if you do chance to hear of that blind traitor 
preferment falls on him that cuts him off 


oswald

would i could meet him  madam  i should show
what party i do follow 


regan

fare thee well
