enter gloucester  and edgar dressed like a peasant


gloucester

when shall we come to the top of that same hill 


edgar

you do climb up it now  look  how we labour 


gloucester

methinks the ground is even 


edgar

horrible steep 
hark  do you hear the sea 


gloucester

no  truly 


edgar

why  then  your other senses grow imperfect
by your eyes  anguish 


gloucester

so may it be  indeed 
methinks thy voice is alter d  and thou speak 
in better phrase and matter than thou didst 


edgar

you much deceived  in nothing am i changed
but in my garments 


gloucester

methinks you better spoken 


edgar

come on  sir  here the place  stand still  how fearful
and dizzy  tis  to cast one eyes so low 
the crows and choughs that wing the midway air
show scarce so gross as beetles  half way down
hangs one that gathers samphire  dreadful trade 
methinks he seems no bigger than his head 
the fishermen  that walk upon the beach 
appear like mice  and yond tall anchoring bark 
diminish to her cock  her cock  a buoy
almost too small for sight  the murmuring surge 
that on the unnumber idle pebbles chafes 
cannot be heard so high  i look no more 
lest my brain turn  and the deficient sight
topple down headlong 


gloucester

set me where you stand 


edgar

give me your hand  you are now within a foot
of the extreme verge  for all beneath the moon
would i not leap upright 


gloucester

let go my hand 
here  friend   another purse  in it a jewel
well worth a poor man taking  fairies and gods
prosper it with thee  go thou farther off 
bid me farewell  and let me hear thee going 


edgar

now fare you well  good sir 


gloucester

with all my heart 


edgar

why i do trifle thus with his despair
is done to cure it 


gloucester

 kneeling   o you mighty gods 
this world i do renounce  and  in your sights 
shake patiently my great affliction off 
if i could bear it longer  and not fall
to quarrel with your great opposeless wills 
my snuff and loathed part of nature should
burn itself out  if edgar live  o  bless him 
now  fellow  fare thee well 
he falls forward


edgar

gone  sir  farewell 
and yet i know not how conceit may rob
the treasury of life  when life itself
yields to the theft  had he been where he thought 
by this  had thought been past  alive or dead 
ho  you sir  friend  hear you  sir  speak 
thus might he pass indeed  yet he revives 
what are you  sir 


gloucester

                  away  and let me die 


edgar

hadst thou been aught but gossamer  feathers  air 
so many fathom down precipitating 
thou shiver like an egg  but thou dost breathe 
hast heavy substance  bleed not  speak st  art sound 
ten masts at each make not the altitude
which thou hast perpendicularly fell 
thy life a miracle  speak yet again 


gloucester

but have i fall n  or no 


edgar

from the dread summit of this chalky bourn 
look up a height  the shrill gorged lark so far
cannot be seen or heard  do but look up 


gloucester

alack  i have no eyes 
is wretchedness deprived that benefit 
to end itself by death   yet some comfort 
when misery could beguile the tyrant rage 
and frustrate his proud will 


edgar

give me your arm 
up  so  how is  t  feel you your legs  you stand 


gloucester

too well  too well 


edgar

this is above all strangeness 
upon the crown o  the cliff  what thing was that
which parted from you 


gloucester

a poor unfortunate beggar 


edgar

as i stood here below  methought his eyes
were two full moons  he had a thousand noses 
horns whelk and waved like the enridged sea 
it was some fiend  therefore  thou happy father 
think that the clearest gods  who make them honours
of men impossibilities  have preserved thee 


gloucester

i do remember now  henceforth i bear
affliction till it do cry out itself
 enough  enough  and die  that thing you speak of 
i took it for a man  often  say
 fiend  the fiend  he led me to that place 


edgar

bear free and patient thoughts  but who comes here 
enter king lear  fantastically dressed with wild flowers
the safer sense will ne accommodate
his master thus 


king lear

no  they cannot touch me for coining  i am the
king himself 


edgar

o thou side piercing sight 


king lear

nature above art in that respect  there your
press money  that fellow handles his bow like a
crow keeper  draw me a clothier yard  look 
look  a mouse  peace  peace  this piece of toasted
cheese will do  t  there my gauntlet  i prove
it on a giant  bring up the brown bills  o  well
flown  bird  i  the clout  i  the clout  hewgh

gloucester

i know that voice 


king lear

ha  goneril  with a white beard  they flattered
me like a dog  and told me i had white hairs in my
beard ere the black ones were there  to say  ay 
and  no  to every thing that i said ay  and  no 
too was no good divinity  when the rain came to
wet me once  and the wind to make me chatter  when
the thunder would not peace at my bidding  there i
found  em  there i smelt  out  go to  they are
not men o  their words  they told me i was every
thing   a lie  i am not ague proof 


gloucester

the trick of that voice i do well remember 
is  not the king 


king lear

ay  every inch a king 
when i do stare  see how the subject quakes 
i pardon that man life  what was thy cause  adultery 
thou shalt not die  die for adultery  no 
the wren goes to  t  and the small gilded fly
does lecher in my sight 
let copulation thrive  for gloucester bastard son
was kinder to his father than my daughters
got  the lawful sheets 
to  t  luxury  pell mell  for i lack soldiers 
behold yond simpering dame 
whose face between her forks presages snow 
that minces virtue  and does shake the head
to hear of pleasure name 
the fitchew  nor the soiled horse  goes to  
with a more riotous appetite 
down from the waist they are centaurs 
though women all above 
but to the girdle do the gods inherit 
beneath is all the fiends 
there hell  there darkness  there the
sulphurous pit 
burning  scalding  stench  consumption  fie

is the justice  which is the thief  thou hast seen
a farmer dog bark at a beggar 


gloucester

and the creature run from the cur  there thou
mightst behold the great image of authority  a
dog obeyed in office

why dost thou lash that whore  strip thine own back 
thou hotly lust to use her in that kind
for which thou whipp her  the usurer hangs the cozener 
through tatter clothes small vices do appear 
robes and furr gowns hide all  plate sin with gold 
and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks 
arm it in rags  a pigmy straw does pierce it 
none does offend  none  i say  none  i able  em 
take that of me  my friend  who have the power
to seal the accuser lips  get thee glass eyes 
and like a scurvy politician  seem
to see the things thou dost not  now  now  now  now
