kind and dear princess 


cordelia

had you not been their father  these white flakes
had challenged pity of them  was this a face
to be opposed against the warring winds 
to stand against the deep dread bolted thunder 
in the most terrible and nimble stroke
of quick  cross lightning  to watch poor perdu 
with this thin helm  mine enemy dog 
though he had bit me  should have stood that night
against my fire  and wast thou fain  poor father 
to hovel thee with swine  and rogues forlorn 
in short and musty straw  alack  alack 
 wonder that thy life and wits at once
had not concluded all  he wakes  speak to him 


doctor

thou art a soul in bliss  but i am bound
upon a wheel of fire  that mine own tears
do scald like moulten lead
