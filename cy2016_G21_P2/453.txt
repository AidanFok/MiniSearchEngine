or whether since he is advised by aught
to change the course  he full of alteration
and self reproving  bring his constant pleasure 
to a gentleman  who goes out


regan

our sister man is certainly miscarried 


edmund

 to be doubted  madam

should loosen him and me 


albany

our very loving sister  well be met 
sir  this i hear  the king is come to his daughter 
with others whom the rigor of our state
forced to cry out  where i could not be honest 
i never yet was valiant  for this business 
it toucheth us  as france invades our land 
not bolds the king  with others  whom  i fear 
most just and heavy causes make oppose 


edmund

sir  you speak nobly 


regan

why is this reason d 


goneril

combine together  the enemy 
for these domestic and particular broils
are not the question here 


albany

let then determine
with the ancient of war on our proceedings 


edmund

i shall attend you presently at your tent 


regan

sister  you go with us

albany

                  i overtake you  speak 
exeunt all but albany and edgar


edgar

before you fight the battle  ope this letter 
if you have victory  let the trumpet sound
for him that brought it  wretched though i seem 
i can produce a champion that will prove
what is avouched there  if you miscarry 
your business of the world hath so an end 
and machination ceases  fortune love you 


albany

stay till i have read the letter 


edgar

i was forbid it 
when time shall serve  let but the herald cry 
and i appear again 


albany

why  fare thee well  i will o thy paper 
exit edgar
re enter edmund


edmund

the enemy in view  draw up your powers 
here is the guess of their true strength and forces
by diligent discovery  but your haste
is now urged on you 


albany

we will greet the time 
exit


edmund

to both these sisters have i sworn my love 
each jealous of the other  as the stung
are of the adder  which of them shall i take 
both  one  or neither  neither can be enjoy d 
if both remain alive  to take the widow
exasperates  makes mad her sister goneril 
and hardly shall i carry out my side 
her husband being alive  now then we use
his countenance for the battle  which being done 
let her who would be rid of him devise
his speedy taking off  as for the mercy
which he intends to lear and to cordelia 
the battle done  and they within our power 
shall never see his pardon  for my state
stands on me to defend  not to debate 
exit
