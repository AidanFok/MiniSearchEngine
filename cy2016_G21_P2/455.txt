who  with best meaning  have incurr the worst 
for thee  oppressed king  am i cast down 
myself could else out frown false fortune frown 
shall we not see these daughters and these sisters 


king lear

no  no  no  no  come  let away to prison 
we two alone will sing like birds i  the cage 
when thou dost ask me blessing  i kneel down 
and ask of thee forgiveness  so we live 
and pray  and sing  and tell old tales  and laugh
at gilded butterflies  and hear poor rogues
talk of court news  and we talk with them too 
who loses and who wins  who in  who out 
and take upon the mystery of things 
as if we were god spies  and we wear out 
in a wall prison  packs and sects of great ones 
that ebb and flow by the moon 


edmund

take them away 


king lear

upon such sacrifices  my cordelia 
the gods themselves throw incense  have i caught thee 
he that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven 
and fire us hence like foxes  wipe thine eyes 
the good years shall devour them  flesh and fell 
ere they shall make us weep  we see  starve
first  come 
exeunt king lear and cordelia  guarded


edmund

come hither  captain  hark

are as the time is  to be tender minded

will not bear question  either say thou do  t 
or thrive by other means

sir  you have shown to day your valiant strain 
and fortune led you well  you have the captives
that were the opposites of this day strife 
we do require them of you  so to use them
as we shall find their merits and our safety
may equally determine 


edmund

sir  i thought it fit
to send the old and miserable king
to some retention and appointed guard 
whose age has charms in it  whose title more 
to pluck the common bosom on his side 
an turn our impress lances in our eyes
which do command them  with him i sent the queen 
my reason all the same  and they are ready
to morrow  or at further space  to appear
where you shall hold your session  at this time
we sweat and bleed  the friend hath lost his friend 
and the best quarrels  in the heat  are cursed
by those that feel their sharpness 
the question of cordelia and her father
requires a fitter place 


albany

sir  by your patience 
i hold you but a subject of this war 
not as a brother 


regan

                  that as we list to grace him 
methinks our pleasure might have been demanded 
ere you had spoke so far  he led our powers 
bore the commission of my place and person 
the which immediacy may well stand up 
and call itself your brother 


goneril

not so hot 
in his own grace he doth exalt himself 
more than in your addition

and that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes 
what safe and nicely i might well delay
by rule of knighthood  i disdain and spurn 
back do i toss these treasons to thy head 
with the hell hated lie o thy heart 
which  for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise 
this sword of mine shall give them instant way 
where they shall rest for ever  trumpets  speak

that hast this fortune on me  if thou noble 
i do forgive thee 


edgar

                  let exchange charity 
i am no less in blood than thou art  edmund 
if more  the more thou hast wrong me 
my name is edgar  and thy father son 
the gods are just  and of our pleasant vices
make instruments to plague us 
the dark and vicious place where thee he got
cost him his eyes 


edmund

                  thou hast spoken right   true 
the wheel is come full circle  i am here 


albany

methought thy very gait did prophesy
a royal nobleness  i must embrace thee 
let sorrow split my heart  if ever i
did hate thee or thy father 


edgar

worthy prince  i know t 


albany

where have you hid yourself 
how have you known the miseries of your father 


edgar

by nursing them  my lord  list a brief tale 
and when  told  o  that my heart would burst 
the bloody proclamation to escape 
that follow me so near o  our lives  sweetness 
that we the pain of death would hourly die
rather than die at once taught me to shift
into a madman rags  to assume a semblance
that very dogs disdain d  and in this habit
met i my father with his bleeding rings 
their precious stones new lost  became his guide 
led him  begg for him  saved him from despair 
never o fault reveal myself unto him 
until some half hour past  when i was arm d 
not sure  though hoping  of this good success 
i ask his blessing  and from first to last
told him my pilgrimage  but his flaw heart 
alack  too weak the conflict to support 
 two extremes of passion  joy and grief 
burst smilingly 


edmund

this speech of yours hath moved me 
and shall perchance do good  but speak you on 
you look as you had something more to say 


albany

if there be more  more woeful  hold it in 
for i am almost ready to dissolve 
hearing of this 


edgar

                  this would have seem a period
to such as love not sorrow  but another 
to amplify too much  would make much more 
and top extremity 
whilst i was big in clamour came there in a man 
who  having seen me in my worst estate 
shunn my abhorr society  but then  finding
who  that so endured  with his strong arms
he fastened on my neck  and bellow out
as he burst heaven  threw him on my father 
told the most piteous tale of lear and him
that ever ear received  which in recounting
his grief grew puissant and the strings of life
began to crack  twice then the trumpets sounded 
and there i left him tranced 


albany

but who was this 


edgar

improper for a slave
