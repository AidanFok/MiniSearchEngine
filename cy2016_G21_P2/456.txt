ferdinand

let fame  that all hunt after in their lives 
live register upon our brazen tombs
and then grace us in the disgrace of death 
when  spite of cormorant devouring time 
the endeavor of this present breath may buy
that honour which shall bate his scythe keen edge
and make us heirs of all eternity 
therefore  brave conquerors for so you are 
that war against your own affections
and the huge army of the world desires 
our late edict shall strongly stand in force 
navarre shall be the wonder of the world 
our court shall be a little academe 
still and contemplative in living art 
you three  biron  dumain  and longaville 
have sworn for three years  term to live with me
my fellow scholars  and to keep those statutes
that are recorded in this schedule here 
your oaths are pass d  and now subscribe your names 
that his own hand may strike his honour down
that violates the smallest branch herein 
if you are arm to do as sworn to do 
subscribe to your deep oaths  and keep it too 


longaville

i am resolved   but a three years  fast 
the mind shall banquet  though the body pine 
fat paunches have lean pates  and dainty bits
make rich the ribs  but bankrupt quite the wits 


dumain

my loving lord  dumain is mortified 
the grosser manner of these world delights
he throws upon the gross world baser slaves 
to love  to wealth  to pomp  i pine and die 
with all these living in philosophy 


biron

i can but say their protestation over 
so much  dear liege  i have already sworn 
that is  to live and study here three years 
but there are other strict observances 
as  not to see a woman in that term 
which i hope well is not enrolled there 
and one day in a week to touch no food
and but one meal on every day beside 
the which i hope is not enrolled there 
and then  to sleep but three hours in the night 
and not be seen to wink of all the day 
when i was wont to think no harm all night
and make a dark night too of half the day 
which i hope well is not enrolled there 
o  these are barren tasks  too hard to keep 
not to see ladies  study  fast  not sleep 


ferdinand

your oath is pass to pass away from these 


biron

let me say no  my liege  an if you please 
i only swore to study with your grace
and stay here in your court for three years  space 


longaville

you swore to that  biron  and to the rest 


biron

by yea and nay  sir  then i swore in jest 
what is the end of study  let me know 


ferdinand

why  that to know  which else we should not know 


biron

things hid and barr d  you mean  from common sense 


ferdinand

ay  that is study godlike recompense 


biron

come on  then  i will swear to study so 
to know the thing i am forbid to know 
as thus to study where i well may dine 
when i to feast expressly am forbid 
or study where to meet some mistress fine 
when mistresses from common sense are hid 
or  having sworn too hard a keeping oath 
study to break it and not break my troth 
if study gain be thus and this be so 
study knows that which yet it doth not know 
swear me to this  and i will ne say no 


ferdinand

these be the stops that hinder study quite
and train our intellects to vain delight 


biron

why  all delights are vain  but that most vain 
which with pain purchased doth inherit pain 
as  painfully to pore upon a book
to seek the light of truth  while truth the while
doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look 
light seeking light doth light of light beguile 
so  ere you find where light in darkness lies 
your light grows dark by losing of your eyes 
study me how to please the eye indeed
by fixing it upon a fairer eye 
who dazzling so  that eye shall be his heed
and give him light that it was blinded by 
study is like the heaven glorious sun
that will not be deep search with saucy looks 
small have continual plodders ever won
save base authority from others  books
these earthly godfathers of heaven lights
that give a name to every fixed star
have no more profit of their shining nights
than those that walk and wot not what they are 
too much to know is to know nought but fame 
and every godfather can give a name 


ferdinand

how well he read  to reason against reading 


dumain

proceeded well  to stop all good proceeding 


longaville

he weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding 


biron

the spring is near when green geese are a breeding 


dumain

how follows that 


biron

                  fit in his place and time 


dumain

in reason nothing 


biron

                  something then in rhyme 


ferdinand

biron is like an envious sneaping frost 
that bites the first born infants of the spring 


biron

well  say i am  why should proud summer boast
before the birds have any cause to sing 
why should i joy in any abortive birth 
at christmas i no more desire a rose
than wish a snow in may new fangled mirth 
but like of each thing that in season grows 
so you  to study now it is too late 
climb o the house to unlock the little gate 


ferdinand

well  sit you out  go home  biron  adieu 


biron

no  my good lord  i have sworn to stay with you 
and though i have for barbarism spoke more
than for that angel knowledge you can say 
yet confident i keep what i have swore
and bide the penance of each three years  day 
give me the paper  let me read the same 
and to the strict decrees i write my name 


ferdinand

how well this yielding rescues thee from shame 


biron

 reads    item  that no woman shall come within a
mile of my court  hath this been proclaimed 


longaville

four days ago 


biron

let see the penalty 
reads
 pain of losing her tongue  who devised this penalty 


longaville

marry  that did i 


biron

sweet lord  and why 


longaville

to fright them hence with that dread penalty 


biron

a dangerous law against gentility 
reads
 item  if any man be seen to talk with a woman
within the term of three years  he shall endure such
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise 
this article  my liege  yourself must break 
for well you know here comes in embassy
the french king daughter with yourself to speak 
a maid of grace and complete majesty 
about surrender up of aquitaine
to her decrepit  sick and bedrid father 
therefore this article is made in vain 
or vainly comes the admired princess hither 


ferdinand

what say you  lords  why  this was quite forgot 


biron

so study evermore is overshot 
while it doth study to have what it would
it doth forget to do the thing it should 
and when it hath the thing it hunteth most 
 won as towns with fire  so won  so lost 


ferdinand

we must of force dispense with this decree 
she must lie here on mere necessity 


biron

necessity will make us all forsworn
three thousand times within this three years  space 
for every man with his affects is born 
not by might master but by special grace 
if i break faith  this word shall speak for me 
i am forsworn on  necessity 
so to the laws at large i write my name 
subscribes
and he that breaks them in the least degree
stands in attainder of eternal shame 
suggestions are to other as to me 
but i believe  although i seem so loath 
i am the last that will last keep his oath 
but is there no quick recreation granted 


ferdinand

ay  that there is  our court  you know  is haunted
with a refined traveller of spain 
a man in all the world new fashion planted 
that hath a mint of phrases in his brain 
one whom the music of his own vain tongue
doth ravish like enchanting harmony 
a man of complements  whom right and wrong
have chose as umpire of their mutiny 
this child of fancy  that armado hight 
for interim to our studies shall relate
in high born words the worth of many a knight
from tawny spain lost in the world debate 
how you delight  my lords  i know not  i 
but  i protest  i love to hear him lie
and i will use him for my minstrelsy 


biron

armado is a most illustrious wight 
a man of fire new words  fashion own knight 


longaville

costard the swain and he shall be our sport 
and so to study  three years is but short 
enter dull with a letter  and costard


dull

which is the duke own person 


biron

this  fellow  what wouldst 


dull

i myself reprehend his own person  for i am his
grace tharborough  but i would see his own person
in flesh and blood 


biron

this is he 


dull

signior arme arme commends you  there villany
abroad  this letter will tell you more 


costard

sir  the contempts thereof are as touching me 


ferdinand

a letter from the magnificent armado 


biron

how low soever the matter  i hope in god for high words 


longaville

a high hope for a low heaven  god grant us patience 


biron

to hear  or forbear laughing 


longaville

to hear meekly  sir  and to laugh moderately  or to
forbear both 


biron

well  sir  be it as the style shall give us cause to
climb in the merriness 


costard

the matter is to me  sir  as concerning jaquenetta 
the manner of it is  i was taken with the manner 


biron

in what manner 


costard

in manner and form following  sir  all those three 
i was seen with her in the manor house  sitting with
her upon the form  and taken following her into the
park  which  put together  is in manner and form
following  now  sir  for the manner it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman  for the form 
in some form 


biron

for the following  sir 


costard

as it shall follow in my correction  and god defend
the right 


ferdinand

will you hear this letter with attention 


biron

as we would hear an oracle 


costard

such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh 


ferdinand

 reads    deputy  the welkin vicegerent and
sole dominator of navarre  my soul earth god 
and body fostering patron 


costard

not a word of costard yet 


ferdinand

 reads    it is 


costard

it may be so  but if he say it is so  he is  in
telling true  but so 


ferdinand

peace 


costard

be to me and every man that dares not fight 


ferdinand

no words 


costard

of other men secrets  i beseech you 


ferdinand

 reads    it is  besieged with sable coloured
melancholy  i did commend the black oppressing humour
to the most wholesome physic of thy health giving
air  and  as i am a gentleman  betook myself to
walk  the time when  about the sixth hour  when
beasts most graze  birds best peck  and men sit down
to that nourishment which is called supper  so much
for the time when  now for the ground which  which 
i mean  i walked upon  it is y cleped thy park  then
for the place where  where  i mean  i did encounter
that obscene and preposterous event  that draweth
from my snow white pen the ebon coloured ink  which
here thou viewest  beholdest  surveyest  or seest 
but to the place where  it standeth north north east
and by east from the west corner of thy curious 
knotted garden  there did i see that low spirited
swain  that base minnow of thy mirth 


costard

me 


ferdinand

 reads    unlettered small knowing soul 


costard

me 


ferdinand

 reads    shallow vassal 


costard

still me 


ferdinand

 reads    which  as i remember  hight costard 


costard

o  me 


ferdinand

 reads    and consorted  contrary to thy
established proclaimed edict and continent canon 
which with o  with but with this i passion to say
wherewith 


costard

with a wench 


ferdinand

 reads    a child of our grandmother eve  a
female  or  for thy more sweet understanding  a
woman  him i  as my ever esteemed duty pricks me on 
have sent to thee  to receive the meed of
punishment  by thy sweet grace officer  anthony
dull  a man of good repute  carriage  bearing  and
estimation 


dull

 me  an shall please you  i am anthony dull 


ferdinand

 reads    jaquenetta so is the weaker vessel
called which i apprehended with the aforesaid
swain i keep her as a vessel of the law fury 
and shall  at the least of thy sweet notice  bring
her to trial  thine  in all compliments of devoted
and heart burning heat of duty 
don adriano de armado 


biron

this is not so well as i looked for  but the best
that ever i heard 


ferdinand

ay  the best for the worst  but  sirrah  what say
you to this 


costard

sir  i confess the wench 


ferdinand

did you hear the proclamation 


costard

i do confess much of the hearing it but little of
the marking of it 


ferdinand

it was proclaimed a year imprisonment  to be taken
with a wench 


costard

i was taken with none  sir  i was taken with a damsel 


ferdinand

well  it was proclaimed  damsel 


costard

this was no damsel  neither  sir  she was a virgin 


ferdinand

it is so varied  too  for it was proclaimed  virgin 


costard

if it were  i deny her virginity  i was taken with a maid 


ferdinand

this maid will not serve your turn  sir 


costard

this maid will serve my turn  sir 


ferdinand

sir  i will pronounce your sentence  you shall fast
a week with bran and water 


costard

i had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge 


ferdinand

and don armado shall be your keeper 
my lord biron  see him deliver o er 
and go we  lords  to put in practise that
which each to other hath so strongly sworn 
exeunt ferdinand  longaville  and dumain


biron

i lay my head to any good man hat 
these oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn 
sirrah  come on 


costard

i suffer for the truth  sir  for true it is  i was
taken with jaquenetta  and jaquenetta is a true
girl  and therefore welcome the sour cup of
prosperity  affliction may one day smile again  and
till then  sit thee down  sorrow
