scene i  the same 


enter the princess of france  rosaline  maria  katharine  boyet  lords  and other attendants


boyet

now  madam  summon up your dearest spirits 
consider who the king your father sends 
to whom he sends  and what his embassy 
yourself  held precious in the world esteem 
to parley with the sole inheritor
of all perfections that a man may owe 
matchless navarre  the plea of no less weight
than aquitaine  a dowry for a queen 
be now as prodigal of all dear grace
as nature was in making graces dear
when she did starve the general world beside
and prodigally gave them all to you 


princess

good lord boyet  my beauty  though but mean 
needs not the painted flourish of your praise 
beauty is bought by judgement of the eye 
not utter by base sale of chapmen tongues 
i am less proud to hear you tell my worth
than you much willing to be counted wise
in spending your wit in the praise of mine 
but now to task the tasker  good boyet 
you are not ignorant  all telling fame
doth noise abroad  navarre hath made a vow 
till painful study shall outwear three years 
no woman may approach his silent court 
therefore to seemeth it a needful course 
before we enter his forbidden gates 
to know his pleasure  and in that behalf 
bold of your worthiness  we single you
as our best moving fair solicitor 
tell him  the daughter of the king of france 
on serious business  craving quick dispatch 
importunes personal conference with his grace 
haste  signify so much  while we attend 
like humble visaged suitors  his high will 


boyet

proud of employment  willingly i go 


princess

all pride is willing pride  and yours is so 
exit boyet
who are the votaries  my loving lords 
that are vow fellows with this virtuous duke 


first lord

lord longaville is one 


princess

know you the man 


maria

i know him  madam  at a marriage feast 
between lord perigort and the beauteous heir
of jaques falconbridge  solemnized
in normandy  saw i this longaville 
a man of sovereign parts he is esteem d 
well fitted in arts  glorious in arms 
nothing becomes him ill that he would well 
the only soil of his fair virtue gloss 
if virtue gloss will stain with any soil 
is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will 
whose edge hath power to cut  whose will still wills
it should none spare that come within his power 


princess

some merry mocking lord  belike  is so 


maria

they say so most that most his humours know 


princess

such short lived wits do wither as they grow 
who are the rest 


katharine

the young dumain  a well accomplished youth 
of all that virtue love for virtue loved 
most power to do most harm  least knowing ill 
for he hath wit to make an ill shape good 
and shape to win grace though he had no wit 
i saw him at the duke alencon once 
and much too little of that good i saw
is my report to his great worthiness 


rosaline

another of these students at that time
was there with him  if i have heard a truth 
biron they call him  but a merrier man 
within the limit of becoming mirth 
i never spent an hour talk withal 
his eye begets occasion for his wit 
for every object that the one doth catch
the other turns to a mirth moving jest 
which his fair tongue  conceit expositor 
delivers in such apt and gracious words
that aged ears play truant at his tales
and younger hearings are quite ravished 
so sweet and voluble is his discourse 


princess

god bless my ladies  are they all in love 
that every one her own hath garnished
with such bedecking ornaments of praise 


first lord

here comes boyet 
re enter boyet


princess

now  what admittance  lord 


boyet

navarre had notice of your fair approach 
and he and his competitors in oath
were all address to meet you  gentle lady 
before i came  marry  thus much i have learnt 
he rather means to lodge you in the field 
like one that comes here to besiege his court 
than seek a dispensation for his oath 
to let you enter his unpeopled house 
here comes navarre 
enter ferdinand  longaville  dumain  biron  and attendants


ferdinand

fair princess  welcome to the court of navarre 


princess

 fair  i give you back again  and  welcome  i have
not yet  the roof of this court is too high to be
yours  and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine 


ferdinand

you shall be welcome  madam  to my court 


princess

i will be welcome  then  conduct me thither 


ferdinand

hear me  dear lady  i have sworn an oath 


princess

our lady help my lord  he be forsworn 


ferdinand

not for the world  fair madam  by my will 


princess

why  will shall break it  will and nothing else 


ferdinand

your ladyship is ignorant what it is 


princess

were my lord so  his ignorance were wise 
where now his knowledge must prove ignorance 
i hear your grace hath sworn out house keeping 
tis deadly sin to keep that oath  my lord 
and sin to break it 
but pardon me  i am too sudden bold 
to teach a teacher ill beseemeth me 
vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming 
and suddenly resolve me in my suit 


ferdinand

madam  i will  if suddenly i may 


princess

you will the sooner  that i were away 
for you prove perjured if you make me stay 


biron

did not i dance with you in brabant once 


rosaline

did not i dance with you in brabant once 


biron

i know you did 


rosaline

how needless was it then to ask the question 


biron

you must not be so quick 


rosaline

 of you that spur me with such questions 


biron

your wit too hot  it speeds too fast   tire 


rosaline

not till it leave the rider in the mire 


biron

what time o  day 


rosaline

the hour that fools should ask 


biron

now fair befall your mask 


rosaline

fair fall the face it covers 


biron

and send you many lovers 


rosaline

amen  so you be none 


biron

nay  then will i be gone 


ferdinand

madam  your father here doth intimate
the payment of a hundred thousand crowns 
being but the one half of an entire sum
disbursed by my father in his wars 
but say that he or we  as neither have 
received that sum  yet there remains unpaid
a hundred thousand more  in surety of the which 
one part of aquitaine is bound to us 
although not valued to the money worth 
if then the king your father will restore
but that one half which is unsatisfied 
we will give up our right in aquitaine 
and hold fair friendship with his majesty 
but that  it seems  he little purposeth 
for here he doth demand to have repaid
a hundred thousand crowns  and not demands 
on payment of a hundred thousand crowns 
to have his title live in aquitaine 
which we much rather had depart withal
and have the money by our father lent
than aquitaine so gelded as it is 
dear princess  were not his requests so far
from reason yielding  your fair self should make
a yielding  some reason in my breast
and go well satisfied to france again 


princess

you do the king my father too much wrong
and wrong the reputation of your name 
in so unseeming to confess receipt
of that which hath so faithfully been paid 


ferdinand

i do protest i never heard of it 
and if you prove it  i repay it back
or yield up aquitaine 


princess

we arrest your word 
boyet  you can produce acquittances
for such a sum from special officers
of charles his father 


ferdinand

satisfy me so 


boyet

so please your grace  the packet is not come
where that and other specialties are bound 
to morrow you shall have a sight of them 


ferdinand

it shall suffice me  at which interview
all liberal reason i will yield unto 
meantime receive such welcome at my hand
as honour without breach of honour may
make tender of to thy true worthiness 
you may not come  fair princess  in my gates 
but here without you shall be so received
as you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart 
though so denied fair harbour in my house 
your own good thoughts excuse me  and farewell 
to morrow shall we visit you again 


princess

sweet health and fair desires consort your grace 


ferdinand

thy own wish wish i thee in every place 
exit


biron

lady  i will commend you to mine own heart 


rosaline

pray you  do my commendations  i would be glad to see it 


biron

i would you heard it groan 


rosaline

is the fool sick 


biron

sick at the heart 


rosaline

alack  let it blood 


biron

would that do it good 


rosaline

my physic says  ay 


biron

will you prick with your eye 


rosaline

no point  with my knife 


biron

now  god save thy life 


rosaline

and yours from long living 


biron

i cannot stay thanksgiving 
retiring


dumain

sir  i pray you  a word  what lady is that same 


boyet

the heir of alencon  katharine her name 


dumain

exit


longaville

i beseech you a word  what is she in the white 


boyet

a woman sometimes  an you saw her in the light 


longaville

perchance light in the light  i desire her name 


boyet

she hath but one for herself  to desire that were a shame 


longaville

pray you  sir  whose daughter 


boyet

her mother s  i have heard 


longaville

god blessing on your beard 


boyet

good sir  be not offended 
she is an heir of falconbridge 


longaville

nay  my choler is ended

maria

that last is biron  the merry madcap lord 
not a word with him but a jest 


boyet

and every jest but a word 


princess

it was well done of you to take him at his word 


boyet

i was as willing to grapple as he was to board 


maria

two hot sheeps  marry 


boyet

and wherefore not ships 
no sheep  sweet lamb  unless we feed on your lips 


maria

you sheep  and i pasture  shall that finish the jest 


boyet

so you grant pasture for me 
offering to kiss her


maria

not so  gentle beast 
my lips are no common  though several they be 


boyet

belonging to whom 


maria

                  to my fortunes and me 


princess

good wits will be jangling  but  gentles  agree 
this civil war of wits were much better used
on navarre and his book men  for here  abused 


boyet

if my observation  which very seldom lies 
by the heart still rhetoric disclosed with eyes 
deceive me not now  navarre is infected 


princess

with what 


boyet

with that which we lovers entitle affected 


princess

your reason 


boyet

why  all his behaviors did make their retire
to the court of his eye  peeping thorough desire 
his heart  like an agate  with your print impress d 
proud with his form  in his eye pride express d 
his tongue  all impatient to speak and not see 
did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be 
all senses to that sense did make their repair 
to feel only looking on fairest of fair 
methought all his senses were lock in his eye 
as jewels in crystal for some prince to buy 
who  tendering their own worth from where they were glass d 
did point you to buy them  along as you pass d 
his face own margent did quote such amazes
that all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes 
i give you aquitaine and all that is his 
an you give him for my sake but one loving kiss 


princess

come to our pavilion  boyet is disposed 


boyet

but to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed 
i only have made a mouth of his eye 
by adding a tongue which i know will not lie 


rosaline

thou art an old love monger and speakest skilfully 


maria

he is cupid grandfather and learns news of him 


rosaline

then was venus like her mother  for her father is but grim 


boyet

do you hear  my mad wenches 


maria

no 


boyet

what then  do you see 


rosaline

ay  our way to be gone 


boyet

you are too hard for me
