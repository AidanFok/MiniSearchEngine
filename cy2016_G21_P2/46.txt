lord bardolph

i spake with one  my lord  that came from thence 
a gentleman well bred and of good name 
that freely render me these news for true

on tuesday last to listen after news

my lord  sir john umfrevile turn me back
with joyful tidings  and  being better horsed 
out rode me  after him came spurring hard
a gentleman  almost forspent with speed 
that stopp by me to breathe his bloodied horse 
he ask the way to chester  and of him
i did demand what news from shrewsbury 
he told me that rebellion had bad luck
and that young harry percy spur was cold 
with that  he gave his able horse the head 
and bending forward struck his armed heels
against the panting sides of his poor jade
up to the rowel head  and starting so
he seem in running to devour the way 
staying no longer question 


northumberland

ha  again 
said he young harry percy spur was cold 
of hotspur coldspur  that rebellion
had met ill luck 


lord bardolph

                  my lord  i tell you what 
if my young lord your son have not the day 
upon mine honour  for a silken point
i give my barony  never talk of it 


northumberland

why should that gentleman that rode by travers
give then such instances of loss 


lord bardolph

who  he 
he was some hilding fellow that had stolen
the horse he rode on  and  upon my life 
spoke at a venture  look  here comes more news 
enter morton


northumberland

yea  this man brow  like to a title leaf 
foretells the nature of a tragic volume 
so looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
hath left a witness usurpation 
say  morton  didst thou come from shrewsbury 


morton

i ran from shrewsbury  my noble lord 
where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
to fright our party 


northumberland

how doth my son and brother 
thou tremblest  and the whiteness in thy cheek
is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand 
even such a man  so faint  so spiritless 
so dull  so dead in look  so woe begone 
drew priam curtain in the dead of night 
and would have told him half his troy was burnt 
but priam found the fire ere he his tongue 
and i my percy death ere thou report it 
this thou wouldst say   son did thus and thus 
your brother thus  so fought the noble douglas 
stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds 
but in the end  to stop my ear indeed 
thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise 
ending with  brother  son  and all are dead 


morton

douglas is living  and your brother  yet 
but  for my lord your son 


northumberland

why  he is dead 
see what a ready tongue suspicion hath 
he that but fears the thing he would not know
hath by instinct knowledge from others  eyes
that what he fear is chanced  yet speak  morton 
tell thou an earl his divination lies 
and i will take it as a sweet disgrace
and make thee rich for doing me such wrong 


morton

you are too great to be by me gainsaid 
your spirit is too true  your fears too certain 


northumberland

yet  for all this  say not that percy dead 
i see a strange confession in thine eye 
thou shakest thy head and hold it fear or sin
to speak a truth  if he be slain  say so 
the tongue offends not that reports his death 
and he doth sin that doth belie the dead 
not he which says the dead is not alive 
yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
hath but a losing office  and his tongue
sounds ever after as a sullen bell 
remember tolling a departing friend 


lord bardolph

i cannot think  my lord  your son is dead 


morton

i am sorry i should force you to believe
that which i would to god i had not seen 
but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state 
rendering faint quittance  wearied and out breathed 
to harry monmouth  whose swift wrath beat down
the never daunted percy to the earth 
from whence with life he never more sprung up 
in few  his death  whose spirit lent a fire
even to the dullest peasant in his camp 
being bruited once  took fire and heat away
from the best temper courage in his troops 
for from his metal was his party steel d 
which once in him abated  all the rest
turn on themselves  like dull and heavy lead 
and as the thing that heavy in itself 
upon enforcement flies with greatest speed 
so did our men  heavy in hotspur loss 
lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
than did our soldiers  aiming at their safety 
fly from the field  then was the noble worcester
too soon ta prisoner  and that furious scot 
the bloody douglas  whose well labouring sword
had three times slain the appearance of the king 
 vail his stomach and did grace the shame
of those that turn their backs  and in his flight 
stumbling in fear  was took  the sum of all
is that the king hath won  and hath sent out
a speedy power to encounter you  my lord 
under the conduct of young lancaster
and westmoreland  this is the news at full 


northumberland

for this i shall have time enough to mourn 
in poison there is physic  and these news 
having been well  that would have made me sick 
being sick  have in some measure made me well 
and as the wretch  whose fever weaken joints 
like strengthless hinges  buckle under life 
impatient of his fit  breaks like a fire
out of his keeper arms  even so my limbs 
weaken with grief  being now enraged with grief 
are thrice themselves  hence  therefore  thou nice crutch 
a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
must glove this hand  and hence  thou sickly quoif 
thou art a guard too wanton for the head
which princes  flesh with conquest  aim to hit 
now bind my brows with iron  and approach
the ragged hour that time and spite dare bring
to frown upon the enraged northumberland 
let heaven kiss earth  now let not nature hand
keep the wild flood confined  let order die 
and let this world no longer be a stage
to feed contention in a lingering act 
but let one spirit of the first born cain
reign in all bosoms  that  each heart being set
on bloody courses  the rude scene may end 
and darkness be the burier of the dead 


travers

this strained passion doth you wrong  my lord 


lord bardolph

sweet earl  divorce not wisdom from your honour 


morton

the lives of all your loving complices
lean on your health  the which  if you give o 
to stormy passion  must perforce decay 
you cast the event of war  my noble lord 
and summ the account of chance  before you said
 us make head  it was your presurmise 
that  in the dole of blows  your son might drop 
you knew he walk o perils  on an edge 
more likely to fall in than to get o er 
you were advised his flesh was capable
of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
would lift him where most trade of danger ranged 
yet did you say  forth  and none of this 
though strongly apprehended  could restrain
the stiff borne action  what hath then befallen 
or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth 
more than that being which was like to be 


lord bardolph

we all that are engaged to this loss
knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
that if we wrought our life  ten to one 
and yet we ventured  for the gain proposed
choked the respect of likely peril fear d 
and since we are o erset  venture again 
come  we will all put forth  body and goods 


morton

 more than time  and  my most noble lord 
i hear for certain  and do speak the truth 
the gentle archbishop of york is up
with well appointed powers  he is a man
who with a double surety binds his followers 
my lord your son had only but the corpse 
but shadows and the shows of men  to fight 
for that same word  rebellion  did divide
the action of their bodies from their souls 
and they did fight with queasiness  constrain d 
as men drink potions  that their weapons only
seem on our side  but  for their spirits and souls 
this word  rebellion  it had froze them up 
as fish are in a pond  but now the bishop
turns insurrection to religion 
supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts 
he followed both with body and with mind 
and doth enlarge his rising with the blood
of fair king richard  scraped from pomfret stones 
derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause 
tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land 
gasping for life under great bolingbroke 
and more and less do flock to follow him 


northumberland

i knew of this before  but  to speak truth 
this present grief had wiped it from my mind 
go in with me  and counsel every man
the aptest way for safety and revenge 
get posts and letters  and make friends with speed 
never so few  and never yet more need 
exeunt
