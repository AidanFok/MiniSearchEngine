scene i  the same 


enter the princess  and her train  a forester  boyet  rosaline  maria  and katharine


princess

was that the king  that spurred his horse so hard
against the steep uprising of the hill 


boyet

i know not  but i think it was not he 


princess

whoe a  was  a  show a mounting mind 
well  lords  to day we shall have our dispatch 
on saturday we will return to france 
then  forester  my friend  where is the bush
that we must stand and play the murderer in 


forester

hereby  upon the edge of yonder coppice 
a stand where you may make the fairest shoot 


princess

i thank my beauty  i am fair that shoot 
and thereupon thou speak the fairest shoot 


forester

pardon me  madam  for i meant not so 


princess

what  what  first praise me and again say no 
o short lived pride  not fair  alack for woe 


forester

yes  madam  fair 


princess

                  nay  never paint me now 
where fair is not  praise cannot mend the brow 
here  good my glass  take this for telling true 
fair payment for foul words is more than due 


forester

nothing but fair is that which you inherit 


princess

see see  my beauty will be saved by merit 
o heresy in fair  fit for these days 
a giving hand  though foul  shall have fair praise 
but come  the bow  now mercy goes to kill 
and shooting well is then accounted ill 
thus will i save my credit in the shoot 
not wounding  pity would not let me do t 
if wounding  then it was to show my skill 
that more for praise than purpose meant to kill 
and out of question so it is sometimes 
glory grows guilty of detested crimes 
when  for fame sake  for praise  an outward part 
we bend to that the working of the heart 
as i for praise alone now seek to spill
the poor deer blood  that my heart means no ill 


boyet

do not curst wives hold that self sovereignty
only for praise sake  when they strive to be
lords o their lords 


princess

only for praise  and praise we may afford
to any lady that subdues a lord 


boyet

here comes a member of the commonwealth 
enter costard


costard

god dig you den all  pray you  which is the head lady 


princess

thou shalt know her  fellow  by the rest that have no heads 


costard

which is the greatest lady  the highest 


princess

the thickest and the tallest 


costard

the thickest and the tallest  it is so  truth is truth 
an your waist  mistress  were as slender as my wit 
one o  these maids  girdles for your waist should be fit 
are not you the chief woman  you are the thickest here 


princess

what your will  sir  what your will 


costard

i have a letter from monsieur biron to one lady rosaline 


princess

o  thy letter  thy letter  he a good friend of mine 
stand aside  good bearer  boyet  you can carve 
break up this capon

boyet

 heaven  that thou art fair  is most infallible 
true  that thou art beauteous  truth itself  that
thou art lovely  more fairer than fair  beautiful
than beauteous  truer than truth itself  have
commiseration on thy heroical vassal  the
magnanimous and most illustrate king cophetua set
eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
zenelophon  and he it was that might rightly say 
veni  vidi  vici  which to annothanize in the
vulgar o base and obscure vulgar videlicet  he
came  saw  and overcame  he came  one  saw two 
overcame  three  who came  the king  why did he
come  to see  why did he see  to overcome  to
whom came he  to the beggar  what saw he  the
beggar  who overcame he  the beggar  the
conclusion is victory  on whose side  the king s 
the captive is enriched  on whose side  the
beggar s  the catastrophe is a nuptial  on whose
side  the king s  no  on both in one  or one in
both  i am the king  for so stands the comparison 
thou the beggar  for so witnesseth thy lowliness 
shall i command thy love  i may  shall i enforce
thy love  i could  shall i entreat thy love  i
will  what shalt thou exchange for rags  robes 
for tittles  titles  for thyself  me  thus 
expecting thy reply  i profane my lips on thy foot 
my eyes on thy picture  and my heart on thy every
part  thine  in the dearest design of industry 
don adriano de armado 
thus dost thou hear the nemean lion roar
 thee  thou lamb  that standest as his prey 
submissive fall his princely feet before 
and he from forage will incline to play 
but if thou strive  poor soul  what art thou then 
food for his rage  repasture for his den 


princess

what vane  what weathercock  did you ever hear better
