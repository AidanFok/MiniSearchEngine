scene ii  the same 


enter holofernes  sir nathaniel  and dull


sir nathaniel

very reverend sport  truly  and done in the testimony
of a good conscience 


holofernes

the deer was  as you know  sanguis  in blood  ripe
as the pomewater  who now hangeth like a jewel in
the ear of caelo  the sky  the welkin  the heaven 
and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra 
the soil  the land  the earth 


sir nathaniel

truly  master holofernes  the epithets are sweetly
varied  like a scholar at the least  but  sir  i
assure ye  it was a buck of the first head 


holofernes

sir nathaniel  haud credo 


dull

 not a haud credo   a pricket 


holofernes

most barbarous intimation  yet a kind of
insinuation  as it were  in via  in way  of
explication  facere  as it were  replication  or
rather  ostentare  to show  as it were  his
inclination  after his undressed  unpolished 
uneducated  unpruned  untrained  or rather 
unlettered  or ratherest  unconfirmed fashion  to
insert again my haud credo for a deer 


dull

i said the deer was not a haud credo  twas a pricket 


holofernes

twice sod simplicity  his coctus 
o thou monster ignorance  how deformed dost thou look 


sir nathaniel

sir  he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
in a book  he hath not eat paper  as it were  he
hath not drunk ink  his intellect is not
replenished  he is only an animal  only sensible in
the duller parts 
and such barren plants are set before us  that we
thankful should be 
which we of taste and feeling are  for those parts that
do fructify in us more than he 
for as it would ill become me to be vain  indiscreet  or a fool 
so were there a patch set on learning  to see him in a school 
but omne bene  say i  being of an old father mind 
many can brook the weather that love not the wind 


dull

you two are book men  can you tell me by your wit
what was a month old at cain birth  that not five
weeks old as yet 


holofernes

dictynna  goodman dull  dictynna  goodman dull 


dull

what is dictynna 


sir nathaniel

a title to phoebe  to luna  to the moon 


holofernes

the moon was a month old when adam was no more 
and raught not to five weeks when he came to
five score 
the allusion holds in the exchange 


dull

 true indeed  the collusion holds in the exchange 


holofernes

god comfort thy capacity  i say  the allusion holds
in the exchange 


dull

and i say  the pollusion holds in the exchange  for
the moon is never but a month old  and i say beside
that   a pricket that the princess killed 


holofernes

sir nathaniel  will you hear an extemporal epitaph
on the death of the deer  and  to humour the
ignorant  call i the deer the princess killed a pricket 


sir nathaniel

perge  good master holofernes  perge  so it shall
please you to abrogate scurrility 


holofernes

i will something affect the letter  for it argues facility 
the preyful princess pierced and prick a pretty
pleasing pricket 
some say a sore  but not a sore  till now made
sore with shooting 
the dogs did yell  put l to sore  then sorel jumps
from thicket 
or pricket sore  or else sorel  the people fall a hooting 
if sore be sore  then l to sore makes fifty sores
one sorel 
of one sore i an hundred make by adding but one more l 


sir nathaniel

a rare talent 


dull

 aside   if a talent be a claw  look how he claws
him with a talent 


holofernes

this is a gift that i have  simple  simple  a
foolish extravagant spirit  full of forms  figures 
shapes  objects  ideas  apprehensions  motions 
revolutions  these are begot in the ventricle of
memory  nourished in the womb of pia mater  and
delivered upon the mellowing of occasion  but the
gift is good in those in whom it is acute  and i am
thankful for it 


sir nathaniel

sir  i praise the lord for you  and so may my
parishioners  for their sons are well tutored by
you  and their daughters profit very greatly under
you  you are a good member of the commonwealth 


holofernes

mehercle  if their sons be ingenuous  they shall
want no instruction  if their daughters be capable 
i will put it to them  but vir sapit qui pauca
loquitur  a soul feminine saluteth us 
enter jaquenetta and costard


jaquenetta

god give you good morrow  master parson 


holofernes

master parson  quasi pers on  an if one should be
pierced  which is the one 


costard

marry  master schoolmaster  he that is likest to a hogshead 


holofernes

piercing a hogshead  a good lustre of conceit in a
tuft of earth  fire enough for a flint  pearl enough
for a swine   pretty  it is well 


jaquenetta

good master parson  be so good as read me this
letter  it was given me by costard  and sent me
from don armado  i beseech you  read it 


holofernes

fauste  precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
ruminat and so forth  ah  good old mantuan  i
may speak of thee as the traveller doth of venice 
venetia  venetia 
chi non ti vede non ti pretia 
old mantuan  old mantuan  who understandeth thee
not  loves thee not  ut  re  sol  la  mi  fa 
under pardon  sir  what are the contents  or rather 
as horace says in his what  my soul  verses 


sir nathaniel

ay  sir  and very learned 


holofernes

let me hear a staff  a stanze  a verse  lege  domine 


sir nathaniel

 reads 
if love make me forsworn  how shall i swear to love 
ah  never faith could hold  if not to beauty vow d 
though to myself forsworn  to thee i faithful prove 
those thoughts to me were oaks  to thee like
osiers bow d 
study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes 
where all those pleasures live that art would
comprehend 
if knowledge be the mark  to know thee shall suffice 
well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend 
all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder 
which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire 
thy eye jove lightning bears  thy voice his dreadful thunder 
which not to anger bent  is music and sweet fire 
celestial as thou art  o  pardon  love  this wrong 
that sings heaven praise with such an earthly tongue 


holofernes

you find not the apostraphas  and so miss the
accent  let me supervise the canzonet  here are
only numbers ratified  but  for the elegancy 
facility  and golden cadence of poesy  caret 
ovidius naso was the man  and why  indeed  naso 
but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
fancy  the jerks of invention  imitari is nothing 
so doth the hound his master  the ape his keeper 
the tired horse his rider  but  damosella virgin 
was this directed to you 


jaquenetta

ay  sir  from one monsieur biron  one of the strange
queen lords 


holofernes

i will overglance the superscript   the
snow white hand of the most beauteous lady
rosaline  i will look again on the intellect of
the letter  for the nomination of the party writing
to the person written unto   ladyship in all
desired employment  biron  sir nathaniel  this
biron is one of the votaries with the king  and here
he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
queen s  which accidentally  or by the way of
progression  hath miscarried  trip and go  my
sweet  deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
king  it may concern much  stay not thy
compliment  i forgive thy duty  adieu 


jaquenetta

good costard  go with me  sir  god save your life 


costard

have with thee  my girl 
exeunt costard and jaquenetta


sir nathaniel

sir  you have done this in the fear of god  very
religiously  and  as a certain father saith 


holofernes

sir tell me not of the father  i do fear colourable
colours  but to return to the verses  did they
please you  sir nathaniel 


sir nathaniel

marvellous well for the pen 


holofernes

i do dine to day at the father of a certain pupil
of mine  where  if  before repast  it shall please
you to gratify the table with a grace  i will  on my
privilege i have with the parents of the foresaid
child or pupil  undertake your ben venuto  where i
will prove those verses to be very unlearned 
neither savouring of poetry  wit  nor invention  i
beseech your society 


sir nathaniel

and thank you too  for society  saith the text  is
the happiness of life 


holofernes

and  certes  the text most infallibly concludes it 
to dull
sir  i do invite you too  you shall not
say me nay  pauca verba  away  the gentles are at
their game  and we will to our recreation 
exeunt
