in the world but lie  and lie in my throat  by
heaven  i do love  and it hath taught me to rhyme
and to be melancholy  and here is part of my rhyme 
and here my melancholy  well  she hath one o  my
sonnets already  the clown bore it  the fool sent

ferdinand

ay me 


biron

 aside   shot  by heaven  proceed  sweet cupid 
thou hast thumped him with thy bird bolt under the
left pap  in faith  secrets 


ferdinand

 reads 
so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
to those fresh morning drops upon the rose 
as thy eye beams  when their fresh rays have smote
the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows 
nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
through the transparent bosom of the deep 
as doth thy face through tears of mine give light 
thou shinest in every tear that i do weep 
no drop but as a coach doth carry thee 
so ridest thou triumphing in my woe 
do but behold the tears that swell in me 
and they thy glory through my grief will show 
but do not love thyself  then thou wilt keep
my tears for glasses  and still make me weep 
o queen of queens  how far dost thou excel 
no thought can think  nor tongue of mortal tell 
how shall she know my griefs  i drop the paper 
sweet leaves  shade folly  who is he comes here 
steps aside
what  longaville  and reading  listen  ear 


biron

now  in thy likeness  one more fool appear 
enter longaville  with a paper


longaville

ay me  i am forsworn 


biron

why  he comes in like a perjure  wearing papers 


ferdinand

in love  i hope  sweet fellowship in shame 


biron

one drunkard loves another of the name 


longaville

am i the first that have been perjured so 


biron

i could put thee in comfort  not by two that i know 
thou makest the triumviry  the corner cap of society 
the shape of love tyburn that hangs up simplicity 


longaville

i fear these stubborn lines lack power to move 
o sweet maria  empress of my love 
these numbers will i tear  and write in prose 


biron

o  rhymes are guards on wanton cupid hose 
disfigure not his slop 


longaville

this same shall go 
reads
did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye 
 whom the world cannot hold argument 
persuade my heart to this false perjury 
vows for thee broke deserve not punishment 
a woman i forswore  but i will prove 
thou being a goddess  i forswore not thee 
my vow was earthly  thou a heavenly love 
thy grace being gain cures all disgrace in me 
vows are but breath  and breath a vapour is 
then thou  fair sun  which on my earth dost shine 
exhalest this vapour vow  in thee it is 
if broken then  it is no fault of mine 
if by me broke  what fool is not so wise
to lose an oath to win a paradise 


biron

this is the liver vein  which makes flesh a deity 
a green goose a goddess  pure  pure idolatry 
god amend us  god amend  we are much out o  the way 


longaville

by whom shall i send this company  stay 
steps aside


biron

all hid  all hid  an old infant play 
like a demigod here sit i in the sky 
and wretched fools  secrets heedfully o ereye 
more sacks to the mill  o heavens  i have my wish 
enter dumain  with a paper
dumain transform d  four woodcocks in a dish 


dumain

o most divine kate 


biron

o most profane coxcomb 


dumain

by heaven  the wonder in a mortal eye 


biron

by earth  she is not  corporal  there you lie 


dumain

her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted 


biron

an amber colour raven was well noted 


dumain

as upright as the cedar 


biron

stoop  i say 
her shoulder is with child 


dumain

as fair as day 


biron

ay  as some days  but then no sun must shine 


dumain

o that i had my wish 


longaville

and i had mine 


ferdinand

and i mine too  good lord 


biron

amen  so i had mine  is not that a good word 


dumain

i would forget her  but a fever she
reigns in my blood and will remember be 


biron

a fever in your blood  why  then incision
would let her out in saucers  sweet misprision 


dumain

once more i read the ode that i have writ 


biron

once more i mark how love can vary wit 


dumain

 reads 
on a day alack the day 
love  whose month is ever may 
spied a blossom passing fair
playing in the wanton air 
through the velvet leaves the wind 
all unseen  can passage find 
that the lover  sick to death 
wish himself the heaven breath 
air  quoth he  thy cheeks may blow 
air  would i might triumph so 
but  alack  my hand is sworn
ne to pluck thee from thy thorn 
vow  alack  for youth unmeet 
youth so apt to pluck a sweet 
do not call it sin in me 
that i am forsworn for thee 
thou for whom jove would swear
juno but an ethiope were 
and deny himself for jove 
turning mortal for thy love 
this will i send  and something else more plain 
that shall express my true love fasting pain 
o  would the king  biron  and longaville 
were lovers too  ill  to example ill 
would from my forehead wipe a perjured note 
for none offend where all alike do dote 


longaville

 advancing   dumain  thy love is far from charity 
you may look pale  but i should blush  i know 
to be o and taken napping so 


ferdinand

 advancing   come  sir  you blush  as his your case is such 
you chide at him  offending twice as much 
you do not love maria  longaville
did never sonnet for her sake compile 
nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
his loving bosom to keep down his heart 
i have been closely shrouded in this bush
and mark you both and for you both did blush 
i heard your guilty rhymes  observed your fashion 
saw sighs reek from you  noted well your passion 
ay me  says one  o jove  the other cries 
one  her hairs were gold  crystal the other eyes 
to longaville
you would for paradise break faith  and troth 
to dumain
and jove  for your love  would infringe an oath 
what will biron say when that he shall hear
faith so infringed  which such zeal did swear 
how will he scorn  how will he spend his wit 
how will he triumph  leap and laugh at it 
for all the wealth that ever i did see 
i would not have him know so much by me 


biron

now step i forth to whip hypocrisy 
advancing
ah  good my liege  i pray thee  pardon me 
good heart  what grace hast thou  thus to reprove
these worms for loving  that art most in love 
your eyes do make no coaches  in your tears
there is no certain princess that appears 
you not be perjured   a hateful thing 
tush  none but minstrels like of sonneting 
but are you not ashamed  nay  are you not 
all three of you  to be thus much o ershot 
you found his mote  the king your mote did see 
but i a beam do find in each of three 
o  what a scene of foolery have i seen 
of sighs  of groans  of sorrow and of teen 
o me  with what strict patience have i sat 
to see a king transformed to a gnat 
to see great hercules whipping a gig 
and profound solomon to tune a jig 
and nestor play at push pin with the boys 
and critic timon laugh at idle toys 
where lies thy grief  o  tell me  good dumain 
and gentle longaville  where lies thy pain 
and where my liege s  all about the breast 
a caudle  ho 


ferdinand

                  too bitter is thy jest 
are we betray thus to thy over view 


biron

not you to me  but i betray by you 
i  that am honest  i  that hold it sin
to break the vow i am engaged in 
i am betray d  by keeping company
with men like men of inconstancy 
when shall you see me write a thing in rhyme 
or groan for love  or spend a minute time
in pruning me  when shall you hear that i
will praise a hand  a foot  a face  an eye 
a gait  a state  a brow  a breast  a waist 
a leg  a limb 


ferdinand

                  soft  whither away so fast 
a true man or a thief that gallops so 


biron

i post from love  good lover  let me go 
enter jaquenetta and costard


jaquenetta

god bless the king 


ferdinand

what present hast thou there 


costard

some certain treason 


ferdinand

what makes treason here 


costard

nay  it makes nothing  sir 


ferdinand

if it mar nothing neither 
the treason and you go in peace away together 


jaquenetta

i beseech your grace  let this letter be read 
our parson misdoubts it   treason  he said 


ferdinand

biron  read it over 
giving him the paper
where hadst thou it 


jaquenetta

of costard 


ferdinand

where hadst thou it 


costard

of dun adramadio  dun adramadio 
biron tears the letter


ferdinand

how now  what is in you  why dost thou tear it 


biron

a toy  my liege  a toy  your grace needs not fear it 


longaville

it did move him to passion  and therefore let hear it 


dumain

it is biron writing  and here is his name 
gathering up the pieces


biron

 to costard   ah  you whoreson loggerhead  you were
born to do me shame 
guilty  my lord  guilty  i confess  i confess 


ferdinand

what 


biron

that you three fools lack me fool to make up the mess 
he  he  and you  and you  my liege  and i 
are pick purses in love  and we deserve to die 
o  dismiss this audience  and i shall tell you more 


dumain

now the number is even 


biron

true  true  we are four 
will these turtles be gone 


ferdinand

hence  sirs  away 


costard

walk aside the true folk  and let the traitors stay 
exeunt costard and jaquenetta


biron

sweet lords  sweet lovers  o  let us embrace 
as true we are as flesh and blood can be 
the sea will ebb and flow  heaven show his face 
young blood doth not obey an old decree 
we cannot cross the cause why we were born 
therefore of all hands must we be forsworn 


ferdinand

what  did these rent lines show some love of thine 


biron

did they  quoth you  who sees the heavenly rosaline 
that  like a rude and savage man of inde 
at the first opening of the gorgeous east 
bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
kisses the base ground with obedient breast 
what peremptory eagle sighted eye
dares look upon the heaven of her brow 
that is not blinded by her majesty 


ferdinand

   what zeal  what fury hath inspired thee now 
my love  her mistress  is a gracious moon 
she an attending star  scarce seen a light 


biron

my eyes are then no eyes  nor i biron 
o  but for my love  day would turn to night 
of all complexions the cull sovereignty
do meet  as at a fair  in her fair cheek 
where several worthies make one dignity 
where nothing wants that want itself doth seek 
lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues 
fie  painted rhetoric  o  she needs it not 
to things of sale a seller praise belongs 
she passes praise  then praise too short doth blot 
a wither hermit  five score winters worn 
might shake off fifty  looking in her eye 
beauty doth varnish age  as if new born 
and gives the crutch the cradle infancy 
o   the sun that maketh all things shine 


ferdinand

   by heaven  thy love is black as ebony 


biron

is ebony like her  o wood divine 
a wife of such wood were felicity 
o  who can give an oath  where is a book 
that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack 
if that she learn not of her eye to look 
no face is fair that is not full so black 


ferdinand

o paradox  black is the badge of hell 
the hue of dungeons and the suit of night 
and beauty crest becomes the heavens well 


biron

   devils soonest tempt  resembling spirits of light 
o  if in black my lady brows be deck d 
it mourns that painting and usurping hair
should ravish doters with a false aspect 
and therefore is she born to make black fair 
her favour turns the fashion of the days 
for native blood is counted painting now 
and therefore red  that would avoid dispraise 
paints itself black  to imitate her brow 


dumain

to look like her are chimney sweepers black 


longaville

   and since her time are colliers counted bright 


ferdinand

and ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack 


dumain

   dark needs no candles now  for dark is light 


biron

your mistresses dare never come in rain 
for fear their colours should be wash away 


ferdinand

 good  yours did  for  sir  to tell you plain 
i find a fairer face not wash to day 


biron

i prove her fair  or talk till doomsday here 


ferdinand

   no devil will fright thee then so much as she 


dumain

i never knew man hold vile stuff so dear 


longaville

   look  here thy love  my foot and her face see 


biron

o  if the streets were paved with thine eyes 
her feet were much too dainty for such tread 


dumain

o  vile  then  as she goes  what upward lies
the street should see as she walk overhead 


ferdinand

but what of this  are we not all in love 


biron

   nothing so sure  and thereby all forsworn 


ferdinand

then leave this chat  and  good biron  now prove
our loving lawful  and our faith not torn 


dumain

ay  marry  there  some flattery for this evil 


longaville

   o  some authority how to proceed 
some tricks  some quillets  how to cheat the devil 


dumain

some salve for perjury 


biron

 more than need 
have at you  then  affection men at arms 
consider what you first did swear unto 
to fast  to study  and to see no woman 
flat treason  the kingly state of youth 
say  can you fast  your stomachs are too young 
and abstinence engenders maladies 
and where that you have vow to study  lords 
in that each of you have forsworn his book 
can you still dream and pore and thereon look 
for when would you  my lord  or you  or you 
have found the ground of study excellence
without the beauty of a woman face 
from women eyes this doctrine i derive   they are the ground  the books  the academes from whence doth spring the true promethean fire
why  universal plodding poisons up
the nimble spirits in the arteries 
as motion and long during action tires
the sinewy vigour of the traveller 
now  for not looking on a woman face 
you have in that forsworn the use of eyes
and study too  the causer of your vow 
for where is any author in the world
teaches such beauty as a woman eye 
learning is but an adjunct to ourself
and where we are our learning likewise is 
then when ourselves we see in ladies  eyes 
do we not likewise see our learning there 
o  we have made a vow to study  lords 
and in that vow we have forsworn our books 
for when would you  my liege  or you  or you 
in leaden contemplation have found out
such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
of beauty tutors have enrich you with 
other slow arts entirely keep the brain 
and therefore  finding barren practisers 
scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil 
but love  first learned in a lady eyes 
lives not alone immured in the brain 
but  with the motion of all elements 
courses as swift as thought in every power 
and gives to every power a double power 
above their functions and their offices 
it adds a precious seeing to the eye 
a lover eyes will gaze an eagle blind 
a lover ear will hear the lowest sound 
when the suspicious head of theft is stopp d 
love feeling is more soft and sensible
than are the tender horns of cockl snails 
love tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste 
for valour  is not love a hercules 
still climbing trees in the hesperides 
subtle as sphinx  as sweet and musical
as bright apollo lute  strung with his hair 
and when love speaks  the voice of all the gods
makes heaven drowsy with the harmony 
never durst poet touch a pen to write
until his ink were temper with love sighs 
o  then his lines would ravish savage ears
and plant in tyrants mild humility 
from women eyes this doctrine i derive 
they sparkle still the right promethean fire 
they are the books  the arts  the academes 
that show  contain and nourish all the world 
else none at all in ought proves excellent 
then fools you were these women to forswear 
or keeping what is sworn  you will prove fools 
for wisdom sake  a word that all men love 
or for love sake  a word that loves all men 
or for men sake  the authors of these women 
or women sake  by whom we men are men 
let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves 
or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths 
it is religion to be thus forsworn 
for charity itself fulfills the law 
and who can sever love from charity 


ferdinand

saint cupid  then  and  soldiers  to the field 


biron

advance your standards  and upon them  lords 
pell mell  down with them  but be first advised 
in conflict that you get the sun of them 


longaville

now to plain dealing  lay these glozes by 
shall we resolve to woo these girls of france 


ferdinand

and win them too  therefore let us devise
some entertainment for them in their tents 


biron

first  from the park let us conduct them thither 
then homeward every man attach the hand
of his fair mistress  in the afternoon
we will with some strange pastime solace them 
such as the shortness of the time can shape 
for revels  dances  masks and merry hours
forerun fair love  strewing her way with flowers 


ferdinand

away  away  no time shall be omitted
that will betime  and may by us be fitted 


biron

allons  allons  sow cockle reap no corn 
and justice always whirls in equal measure 
light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn 
if so  our copper buys no better treasure
