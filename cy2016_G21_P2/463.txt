novi hominem tanquam te  his humour is lofty  his
discourse peremptory  his tongue filed  his eye
ambitious  his gait majestical  and his general
behavior vain  ridiculous  and thrasonical  he is
too picked  too spruce  too affected  too odd  as it
were  too peregrinate  as i may call it 


sir nathaniel

a most singular and choice epithet 
draws out his table book

than the staple of his argument  i abhor such
fanatical phantasimes  such insociable and
point devise companions  such rackers of
orthography  as to speak dout  fine  when he should
say doubt  det  when he should pronounce debt d

grace  by the world  sometime to lean upon my poor
shoulder  and with his royal finger  thus  dally
with my excrement  with my mustachio  but  sweet
heart  let that pass  by the world  i recount no
fable  some certain special honours it pleaseth his
greatness to impart to armado  a soldier  a man of
travel  that hath seen the world  but let that pass 
the very all of all is but  sweet heart  i do
implore secrecy that the king would have me
present the princess  sweet chuck  with some
delightful ostentation  or show  or pageant  or
antique  or firework  now  understanding that the
