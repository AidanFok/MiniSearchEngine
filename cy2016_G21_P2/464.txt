scene ii  the same 


enter the princess  katharine  rosaline  and maria


princess

sweet hearts  we shall be rich ere we depart 
if fairings come thus plentifully in 
a lady wall about with diamonds 
look you what i have from the loving king 


rosaline

madame  came nothing else along with that 


princess

nothing but this  yes  as much love in rhyme
as would be cramm up in a sheet of paper 
writ o  both sides the leaf  margent and all 
that he was fain to seal on cupid name 


rosaline

that was the way to make his godhead wax 
for he hath been five thousand years a boy 


katharine

ay  and a shrewd unhappy gallows too 


rosaline

you ne be friends with him  a  kill your sister 


katharine

he made her melancholy  sad  and heavy 
and so she died  had she been light  like you 
of such a merry  nimble  stirring spirit 
she might ha  been a grandam ere she died 
and so may you  for a light heart lives long 


rosaline

what your dark meaning  mouse  of this light word 


katharine

a light condition in a beauty dark 


rosaline

we need more light to find your meaning out 


katharine

you mar the light by taking it in snuff 
therefore i darkly end the argument 


rosaline

look what you do  you do it still i  the dark 


katharine

so do not you  for you are a light wench 


rosaline

indeed i weigh not you  and therefore light 


katharine

you weigh me not  o  that you care not for me 


rosaline

great reason  for  cure is still past care 


princess

well bandied both  a set of wit well play d 
but rosaline  you have a favour too 
who sent it  and what is it 


rosaline

i would you knew 
an if my face were but as fair as yours 
my favour were as great  be witness this 
nay  i have verses too  i thank biron 
the numbers true  and  were the numbering too 
i were the fairest goddess on the ground 
i am compared to twenty thousand fairs 
o  he hath drawn my picture in his letter 


princess

any thing like 


rosaline

much in the letters  nothing in the praise 


princess

beauteous as ink  a good conclusion 


katharine

fair as a text b in a copy book 


rosaline

 pencils  ho  let me not die your debtor 
my red dominical  my golden letter 
o  that your face were not so full of o s 


katharine

a pox of that jest  and i beshrew all shrows 


princess

but  katharine  what was sent to you from fair dumain 


katharine

madam  this glove 


princess

                  did he not send you twain 


katharine

yes  madam  and moreover
some thousand verses of a faithful lover 
a huge translation of hypocrisy 
vilely compiled  profound simplicity 


maria

this and these pearls to me sent longaville 
the letter is too long by half a mile 


princess

i think no less  dost thou not wish in heart
the chain were longer and the letter short 


maria

ay  or i would these hands might never part 


princess

we are wise girls to mock our lovers so 


rosaline

they are worse fools to purchase mocking so 
that same biron i torture ere i go 
o that i knew he were but in by the week 
how i would make him fawn and beg and seek
and wait the season and observe the times
and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
and shape his service wholly to my hests
and make him proud to make me proud that jests 
so perttaunt like would i o his state
that he should be my fool and i his fate 


princess

none are so surely caught  when they are catch d 
as wit turn fool  folly  in wisdom hatch d 
hath wisdom warrant and the help of school
and wit own grace to grace a learned fool 


rosaline

the blood of youth burns not with such excess
as gravity revolt to wantonness 


maria

folly in fools bears not so strong a note
as foolery in the wise  when wit doth dote 
since all the power thereof it doth apply
to prove  by wit  worth in simplicity 


princess

here comes boyet  and mirth is in his face 
enter boyet


boyet

o  i am stabb with laughter  where her grace 


princess

thy news boyet 


boyet

                  prepare  madam  prepare 
arm  wenches  arm  encounters mounted are
against your peace  love doth approach disguised 
armed in arguments  you be surprised 
muster your wits  stand in your own defence 
or hide your heads like cowards  and fly hence 


princess

saint denis to saint cupid  what are they
that charge their breath against us  say  scout  say 


boyet

under the cool shade of a sycamore
i thought to close mine eyes some half an hour 
when  lo  to interrupt my purposed rest 
toward that shade i might behold addrest
the king and his companions  warily
i stole into a neighbour thicket by 
and overheard what you shall overhear 
that  by and by  disguised they will be here 
their herald is a pretty knavish page 
that well by heart hath conn his embassage 
action and accent did they teach him there 
 must thou speak  and  thy body bear 
and ever and anon they made a doubt
presence majestical would put him out 
 for  quoth the king   angel shalt thou see 
yet fear not thou  but speak audaciously 
the boy replied   angel is not evil 
i should have fear her had she been a devil 
with that  all laugh and clapp him on the shoulder 
making the bold wag by their praises bolder 
one rubb his elbow thus  and fleer and swore
a better speech was never spoke before 
another  with his finger and his thumb 
cried   via  we will do t  come what will come 
the third he caper d  and cried   goes well 
the fourth turn on the toe  and down he fell 
with that  they all did tumble on the ground 
with such a zealous laughter  so profound 
that in this spleen ridiculous appears 
to cheque their folly  passion solemn tears 


princess

but what  but what  come they to visit us 


boyet

they do  they do  and are apparell thus 
like muscovites or russians  as i guess 
their purpose is to parle  to court and dance 
and every one his love feat will advance
unto his several mistress  which they know
by favours several which they did bestow 


princess

and will they so  the gallants shall be task d 
for  ladies  we shall every one be mask d 
and not a man of them shall have the grace 
despite of suit  to see a lady face 
hold  rosaline  this favour thou shalt wear 
and then the king will court thee for his dear 
hold  take thou this  my sweet  and give me thine 
so shall biron take me for rosaline 
and change your favours too  so shall your loves
woo contrary  deceived by these removes 


rosaline

come on  then  wear the favours most in sight 


katharine

but in this changing what is your intent 


princess

the effect of my intent is to cross theirs 
they do it but in mocking merriment 
and mock for mock is only my intent 
their several counsels they unbosom shall
to loves mistook  and so be mock withal
upon the next occasion that we meet 
with visages displayed  to talk and greet 


rosaline

but shall we dance  if they desire to t 


princess

no  to the death  we will not move a foot 
nor to their penn speech render we no grace 
but while  spoke each turn away her face 


boyet

why  that contempt will kill the speaker heart 
and quite divorce his memory from his part 


princess

therefore i do it  and i make no doubt
the rest will ne come in  if he be out
there no such sport as sport by sport o erthrown 
to make theirs ours and ours none but our own 
so shall we stay  mocking intended game 
and they  well mock d  depart away with shame 
trumpets sound within


boyet

the trumpet sounds  be mask d  the maskers come 
the ladies mask
enter blackamoors with music  moth  ferdinand   biron  longaville  and dumain  in russian habits  and masked


moth

all hail  the richest beauties on the earth 


boyet

beauties no richer than rich taffeta 


moth

a holy parcel of the fairest dames 
the ladies turn their backs to him
that ever turn their backs to mortal views 


biron

 aside to moth   their eyes  villain  their eyes 


moth

that ever turn their eyes to mortal views out 


boyet

true  out indeed 


moth

out of your favours  heavenly spirits  vouchsafe
not to behold 


biron

 aside to moth   once to behold  rogue 


moth

once to behold with your sun beamed eyes 
 with your sun beamed eyes 


boyet

they will not answer to that epithet 
you were best call it  daughter beamed eyes 


moth

they do not mark me  and that brings me out 


biron

is this your perfectness  be gone  you rogue 
exit moth


rosaline

what would these strangers  know their minds  boyet 
if they do speak our language   our will 
that some plain man recount their purposes
know what they would 


boyet

what would you with the princess 


biron

nothing but peace and gentle visitation 


rosaline

what would they  say they 


boyet

nothing but peace and gentle visitation 


rosaline

why  that they have  and bid them so be gone 


boyet

she says  you have it  and you may be gone 


ferdinand

say to her  we have measured many miles
to tread a measure with her on this grass 


boyet

they say  that they have measured many a mile
to tread a measure with you on this grass 


rosaline

it is not so  ask them how many inches
is in one mile  if they have measured many 
the measure then of one is easily told 


boyet

if to come hither you have measured miles 
and many miles  the princess bids you tell
how many inches doth fill up one mile 


biron

tell her  we measure them by weary steps 


boyet

she hears herself 


rosaline

                  how many weary steps 
of many weary miles you have o ergone 
are number in the travel of one mile 


biron

we number nothing that we spend for you 
our duty is so rich  so infinite 
that we may do it still without accompt 
vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face 
that we  like savages  may worship it 


rosaline

my face is but a moon  and clouded too 


ferdinand

blessed are clouds  to do as such clouds do 
vouchsafe  bright moon  and these thy stars  to shine 
those clouds removed  upon our watery eyne 


rosaline

o vain petitioner  beg a greater matter 
thou now request but moonshine in the water 


ferdinand

then  in our measure do but vouchsafe one change 
thou bid me beg  this begging is not strange 


rosaline

play  music  then  nay  you must do it soon 
music plays
not yet  no dance  thus change i like the moon 


ferdinand

will you not dance  how come you thus estranged 


rosaline

you took the moon at full  but now she changed 


ferdinand

yet still she is the moon  and i the man 
the music plays  vouchsafe some motion to it 


rosaline

our ears vouchsafe it 


ferdinand

but your legs should do it 


rosaline

since you are strangers and come here by chance 
we not be nice  take hands  we will not dance 


ferdinand

why take we hands  then 


rosaline

only to part friends 
curtsy  sweet hearts  and so the measure ends 


ferdinand

more measure of this measure  be not nice 


rosaline

we can afford no more at such a price 


ferdinand

prize you yourselves  what buys your company 


rosaline

your absence only 


ferdinand

                  that can never be 


rosaline

then cannot we be bought  and so  adieu 
twice to your visor  and half once to you 


ferdinand

if you deny to dance  let hold more chat 


rosaline

in private  then 


ferdinand

                  i am best pleased with that 
they converse apart


biron

white handed mistress  one sweet word with thee 


princess

honey  and milk  and sugar  there is three 


biron

nay then  two treys  and if you grow so nice 
metheglin  wort  and malmsey  well run  dice 
there half a dozen sweets 


princess

seventh sweet  adieu 
since you can cog  i play no more with you 


biron

one word in secret 


princess

let it not be sweet 


biron

thou grievest my gall 


princess

gall  bitter 


biron

therefore meet 
they converse apart


dumain

will you vouchsafe with me to change a word 


maria

dumain

maria

say you so  fair lord 
take that for your fair lady 


dumain

please it you 
as much in private  and i bid adieu 
they converse apart


katharine

what  was your vizard made without a tongue 


longaville

i know the reason  lady  why you ask 


katharine

o for your reason  quickly  sir  i long 


longaville

you have a double tongue within your mask 
and would afford my speechless vizard half 


katharine

veal  quoth the dutchman  is not  veal  a calf 


longaville

a calf  fair lady 


katharine

longaville

let part the word 


katharine

take all  and wean it  it may prove an ox 


longaville

look  how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks 
will you give horns  chaste lady  do not so 


katharine

then die a calf  before your horns do grow 


longaville

one word in private with you  ere i die 


katharine

bleat softly then  the butcher hears you cry 
they converse apart


boyet

the tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
as is the razor edge invisible 
cutting a smaller hair than may be seen 
above the sense of sense  so sensible
seemeth their conference  their conceits have wings
fleeter than arrows  bullets  wind  thought  swifter things 


rosaline

not one word more  my maids  break off  break off 


biron

by heaven  all dry beaten with pure scoff 


ferdinand

farewell  mad wenches  you have simple wits 


princess

twenty adieus  my frozen muscovits 
exeunt ferdinand  lords  and blackamoors
are these the breed of wits so wonder at 


boyet

tapers they are  with your sweet breaths puff out 


rosaline

well liking wits they have  gross  gross  fat  fat 


princess

o poverty in wit  kingly poor flout 
will they not  think you  hang themselves tonight 
or ever  but in vizards  show their faces 
this pert biron was out of countenance quite 


rosaline

o  they were all in lamentable cases 
the king was weeping ripe for a good word 


princess

biron did swear himself out of all suit 


maria

dumain was at my service  and his sword 
no point  quoth i  my servant straight was mute 


katharine

lord longaville said  i came o his heart 
and trow you what he called me 


princess

qualm  perhaps 


katharine

yes  in good faith 


princess

go  sickness as thou art 


rosaline

well  better wits have worn plain statute caps 
but will you hear  the king is my love sworn 


princess

and quick biron hath plighted faith to me 


katharine

and longaville was for my service born 


maria

dumain is mine  as sure as bark on tree 


boyet

madam  and pretty mistresses  give ear 
immediately they will again be here
in their own shapes  for it can never be
they will digest this harsh indignity 


princess

will they return 


boyet

                  they will  they will  god knows 
and leap for joy  though they are lame with blows 
therefore change favours  and  when they repair 
blow like sweet roses in this summer air 


princess

how blow  how blow  speak to be understood 


boyet

fair ladies mask are roses in their bud 
dismask d  their damask sweet commixture shown 
are angels vailing clouds  or roses blown 


princess

avaunt  perplexity  what shall we do 
if they return in their own shapes to woo 


rosaline

good madam  if by me you be advised 
let s  mock them still  as well known as disguised 
let us complain to them what fools were here 
disguised like muscovites  in shapeless gear 
and wonder what they were and to what end
their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn 
and their rough carriage so ridiculous 
should be presented at our tent to us 


boyet

ladies  withdraw  the gallants are at hand 


princess

whip to our tents  as roes run o land 
exeunt princess  rosaline  katharine  and maria
re enter ferdinand  biron  longaville  and dumain  in their proper habits


ferdinand

fair sir  god save you  where the princess

command me any service to her thither 


ferdinand

that she vouchsafe me audience for one word 


boyet

i will  and so will she  i know  my lord 
exit


biron

this fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease 
and utters it again when god doth please 
he is wit pedler  and retails his wares
at wakes and wassails  meetings  markets  fairs 
and we that sell by gross  the lord doth know 
have not the grace to grace it with such show 
this gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve 
had he been adam  he had tempted eve 
a  can carve too  and lisp  why  this is he
that kiss his hand away in courtesy 
this is the ape of form  monsieur the nice 
that  when he plays at tables  chides the dice
in honourable terms  nay  he can sing
a mean most meanly  and in ushering
mend him who can  the ladies call him sweet 
the stairs  as he treads on them  kiss his feet 
this is the flower that smiles on every one 
to show his teeth as white as whale bone 
and consciences  that will not die in debt 
pay him the due of honey tongued boyet 


ferdinand

a blister on his sweet tongue  with my heart 
that put armado page out of his part 


biron

see where it comes  behavior  what wert thou
till this madman show thee  and what art thou now 
re enter the princess  ushered by boyet  rosaline  maria  and katharine


ferdinand

all hail  sweet madam  and fair time of day 


princess

 fair  in  hail  is foul  as i conceive 


ferdinand

construe my speeches better  if you may 


princess

then wish me better  i will give you leave 


ferdinand

we came to visit you  and purpose now
to lead you to our court  vouchsafe it then 


princess

this field shall hold me  and so hold your vow 
nor god  nor i  delights in perjured men 


ferdinand

rebuke me not for that which you provoke 
the virtue of your eye must break my oath 


princess

you nickname virtue  vice you should have spoke 
for virtue office never breaks men troth 
now by my maiden honour  yet as pure
as the unsullied lily  i protest 
a world of torments though i should endure 
i would not yield to be your house guest 
so much i hate a breaking cause to be
of heavenly oaths  vow with integrity 


ferdinand

o  you have lived in desolation here 
unseen  unvisited  much to our shame 


princess

not so  my lord  it is not so  i swear 
we have had pastimes here and pleasant game 
a mess of russians left us but of late 


ferdinand

how  madam  russians 


princess

ay  in truth  my lord 
trim gallants  full of courtship and of state 


rosaline

madam  speak true  it is not so  my lord 
my lady  to the manner of the days 
in courtesy gives undeserving praise 
we four indeed confronted were with four
in russian habit  here they stay an hour 
and talk apace  and in that hour  my lord 
they did not bless us with one happy word 
i dare not call them fools  but this i think 
when they are thirsty  fools would fain have drink 


biron

this jest is dry to me  fair gentle sweet 
your wit makes wise things foolish  when we greet 
with eyes best seeing  heaven fiery eye 
by light we lose light  your capacity
is of that nature that to your huge store
wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor 


rosaline

this proves you wise and rich  for in my eye 


biron

i am a fool  and full of poverty 


rosaline

but that you take what doth to you belong 
it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue 


biron

o  i am yours  and all that i possess 


rosaline

all the fool mine 


biron

                  i cannot give you less 


rosaline

which of the vizards was it that you wore 


biron

where  when  what vizard  why demand you this 


rosaline

there  then  that vizard  that superfluous case
that hid the worse and show the better face 


ferdinand

we are descried  they mock us now downright 


dumain

let us confess and turn it to a jest 


princess

amazed  my lord  why looks your highness sad 


rosaline

help  hold his brows  he swoon  why look you pale 
sea sick  i think  coming from muscovy 


biron

thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury 
can any face of brass hold longer out 


here stand i

lady  dart thy skill at me 
bruise me with scorn  confound me with a flout 
thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance 
cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit 
and i will wish thee never more to dance 
nor never more in russian habit wait 
o  never will i trust to speeches penn d 
nor to the motion of a schoolboy tongue 
nor never come in vizard to my friend 
nor woo in rhyme  like a blind harper song 
taffeta phrases  silken terms precise 
three piled hyperboles  spruce affectation 
figures pedantical  these summer flies
have blown me full of maggot ostentation 
i do forswear them  and i here protest 
by this white glove how white the hand  god knows 
henceforth my wooing mind shall be express 
in russet yeas and honest kersey noes 
and  to begin  wench so god help me  la 
my love to thee is sound  sans crack or flaw 


rosaline

sans sans  i pray you 


biron

yet i have a trick
of the old rage  bear with me  i am sick 
i leave it by degrees  soft  let us see 
write   have mercy on us  on those three 
they are infected  in their hearts it lies 
they have the plague  and caught it of your eyes 
these lords are visited  you are not free 
for the lord tokens on you do i see 


princess

no  they are free that gave these tokens to us 


biron

our states are forfeit  seek not to undo us 


rosaline

it is not so  for how can this be true 
that you stand forfeit  being those that sue 


biron

peace  for i will not have to do with you 


rosaline

nor shall not  if i do as i intend 


biron

speak for yourselves  my wit is at an end 


ferdinand

teach us  sweet madam  for our rude transgression

told our intents before  which once disclosed 
the ladies did change favours  and then we 
following the signs  woo but the sign of she

exeunt worthies


ferdinand

how fares your majesty 


princess

boyet  prepare  i will away tonight 


ferdinand

madam  not so  i do beseech you  stay 


princess

prepare  i say  i thank you  gracious lords 
for all your fair endeavors  and entreat 
out of a new sad soul  that you vouchsafe
in your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
the liberal opposition of our spirits 
if over boldly we have borne ourselves
in the converse of breath  your gentleness
was guilty of it  farewell worthy lord 
a heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue 
excuse me so  coming too short of thanks
for my great suit so easily obtain d 


ferdinand

the extreme parts of time extremely forms
all causes to the purpose of his speed 
and often at his very loose decides
that which long process could not arbitrate 
and though the mourning brow of progeny
forbid the smiling courtesy of love
the holy suit which fain it would convince 
yet  since love argument was first on foot 
let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
from what it purposed  since  to wail friends lost
is not by much so wholesome profitable
as to rejoice at friends but newly found 


princess

i understand you not  my griefs are double 


biron

honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief 
and by these badges understand the king 
for your fair sakes have we neglected time 
play foul play with our oaths  your beauty  ladies 
hath much deform us  fashioning our humours
even to the opposed end of our intents 
and what in us hath seem ridiculous 
as love is full of unbefitting strains 
all wanton as a child  skipping and vain 
form by the eye and therefore  like the eye 
full of strange shapes  of habits and of forms 
varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
to every varied object in his glance 
which parti coated presence of loose love
put on by us  if  in your heavenly eyes 
have misbecomed our oaths and gravities 
those heavenly eyes  that look into these faults 
suggested us to make  therefore  ladies 
our love being yours  the error that love makes
is likewise yours  we to ourselves prove false 
by being once false for ever to be true
to those that make us both fair ladies  you 
and even that falsehood  in itself a sin 
thus purifies itself and turns to grace 


princess

we have received your letters full of love 
your favours  the ambassadors of love 
and  in our maiden council  rated them
at courtship  pleasant jest and courtesy 
as bombast and as lining to the time 
but more devout than this in our respects
have we not been  and therefore met your loves
in their own fashion  like a merriment 


dumain

our letters  madam  show much more than jest 


longaville

so did our looks 


rosaline

                  we did not quote them so 


ferdinand

now  at the latest minute of the hour 
grant us your loves 


princess

a time  methinks  too short
to make a world without end bargain in 
no  no  my lord  your grace is perjured much 
full of dear guiltiness  and therefore this 
if for my love  as there is no such cause 
you will do aught  this shall you do for me 
your oath i will not trust  but go with speed
to some forlorn and naked hermitage 
remote from all the pleasures of the world 
there stay until the twelve celestial signs
have brought about the annual reckoning 
if this austere insociable life
change not your offer made in heat of blood 
if frosts and fasts  hard lodging and thin weeds
nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love 
but that it bear this trial and last love 
then  at the expiration of the year 
come challenge me  challenge me by these deserts 
and  by this virgin palm now kissing thine
i will be thine  and till that instant shut
my woeful self up in a mourning house 
raining the tears of lamentation
for the remembrance of my father death 
if this thou do deny  let our hands part 
neither entitled in the other heart 


ferdinand

if this  or more than this  i would deny 
to flatter up these powers of mine with rest 
the sudden hand of death close up mine eye 
hence ever then my heart is in thy breast 


dumain

but what to me  my love  but what to me  a wife 


katharine

a beard  fair health  and honesty 
with three fold love i wish you all these three 


dumain

o  shall i say  i thank you  gentle wife 


katharine

not so  my lord  a twelvemonth and a day
i mark no words that smooth faced wooers say 
come when the king doth to my lady come 
then  if i have much love  i give you some 


dumain

i serve thee true and faithfully till then 


katharine

yet swear not  lest ye be forsworn again 


longaville

what says maria 


maria

                  at the twelvemonth end
i change my black gown for a faithful friend 


longaville

i stay with patience  but the time is long 


maria

the liker you  few taller are so young 


biron

studies my lady  mistress  look on me 
behold the window of my heart  mine eye 
what humble suit attends thy answer there 
impose some service on me for thy love 


rosaline

oft have i heard of you  my lord biron 
before i saw you  and the world large tongue
proclaims you for a man replete with mocks 
full of comparisons and wounding flouts 
which you on all estates will execute
that lie within the mercy of your wit 
to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain 
and therewithal to win me  if you please 
without the which i am not to be won 
you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
visit the speechless sick and still converse
with groaning wretches  and your task shall be 
with all the fierce endeavor of your wit
to enforce the pained impotent to smile 


biron

to move wild laughter in the throat of death 
it cannot be  it is impossible 
mirth cannot move a soul in agony 


rosaline

why  that the way to choke a gibing spirit 
whose influence is begot of that loose grace
which shallow laughing hearers give to fools 
a jest prosperity lies in the ear
of him that hears it  never in the tongue
of him that makes it  then  if sickly ears 
deaf with the clamours of their own dear groans 
will hear your idle scorns  continue then 
and i will have you and that fault withal 
but if they will not  throw away that spirit 
and i shall find you empty of that fault 
right joyful of your reformation 


biron

a twelvemonth  well  befall what will befall 
i jest a twelvemonth in an hospital 


princess

jack hath not jill  these ladies  courtesy
might well have made our sport a comedy

unpleasing to a married ear 
when shepherds pipe on oaten straws
and merry larks are ploughmen clocks 
when turtles tread  and rooks  and daws 
and maidens bleach their summer smocks
the cuckoo then  on every tree 
mocks married men  for thus sings he  	cuckoo 
cuckoo  cuckoo  o word of fear 
unpleasing to a married ear 
winter 
when icicles hang by the wall
and dick the shepherd blows his nail
and tom bears logs into the hall
and milk comes frozen home in pail 
when blood is nipp and ways be foul 
then nightly sings the staring owl  	tu whit 
tu who  a merry note 
while greasy joan doth keel the pot 
when all aloud the wind doth blow
and coughing drowns the parson saw
and birds sit brooding in the snow
and marian nose looks red and raw 
when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl 
then nightly sings the staring owl  	tu whit 
tu who  a merry note 
while greasy joan doth keel the pot 
don

the words of mercury are harsh after the songs of
apollo  you that way  we this way 
exeunt
