scene ii  a camp near forres 


alarum within  enter duncan  malcolm  donalbain  lennox  with attendants  meeting a bleeding sergeant


duncan

what bloody man is that  he can report 
as seemeth by his plight  of the revolt
the newest state 


malcolm

                  this is the sergeant
who like a good and hardy soldier fought
 my captivity  hail  brave friend 
say to the king the knowledge of the broil
as thou didst leave it 


sergeant

doubtful it stood 
as two spent swimmers  that do cling together
and choke their art  the merciless macdonwald 
worthy to be a rebel  for to that
the multiplying villanies of nature
do swarm upon him from the western isles
of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied 
and fortune  on his damned quarrel smiling 
show like a rebel whore  but all too weak 
for brave macbeth well he deserves that name 
disdaining fortune  with his brandish steel 
which smoked with bloody execution 
like valour minion carved out his passage
till he faced the slave 
which ne shook hands  nor bade farewell to him 
till he unseam him from the nave to the chaps 
and fix his head upon our battlements 


duncan

o valiant cousin  worthy gentleman 


sergeant

as whence the sun  his reflection
shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break 
so from that spring whence comfort seem to come
discomfort swells  mark  king of scotland  mark 
no sooner justice had with valour arm 
compell these skipping kerns to trust their heels 
but the norweyan lord surveying vantage 
with furbish arms and new supplies of men
began a fresh assault 


duncan

dismay not this
our captains  macbeth and banquo 


sergeant

yes 
as sparrows eagles  or the hare the lion 
if i say sooth  i must report they were
as cannons overcharged with double cracks  so they
doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe 
except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds 
or memorise another golgotha 
i cannot tell 
but i am faint  my gashes cry for help 


duncan

so well thy words become thee as thy wounds 
they smack of honour both  go get him surgeons 
exit sergeant  attended
who comes here 
enter ross


malcolm

                  the worthy thane of ross 


lennox

what a haste looks through his eyes  so should he look
that seems to speak things strange 


ross

god save the king 


duncan

whence camest thou  worthy thane 


ross

from fife  great king 
where the norweyan banners flout the sky
and fan our people cold  norway himself 
with terrible numbers 
assisted by that most disloyal traitor
the thane of cawdor  began a dismal conflict 
till that bellona bridegroom  lapp in proof 
confronted him with self comparisons 
point against point rebellious  arm  arm 
curbing his lavish spirit  and  to conclude 
the victory fell on us 


duncan

great happiness 


ross

that now
sweno  the norways  king  craves composition 
nor would we deign him burial of his men
till he disbursed at saint colme inch
ten thousand dollars to our general use 


duncan

no more that thane of cawdor shall deceive
our bosom interest  go pronounce his present death 
and with his former title greet macbeth 


ross

i see it done 


duncan

what he hath lost noble macbeth hath won 
exeunt
