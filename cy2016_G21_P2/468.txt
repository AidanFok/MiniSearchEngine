is execution done on cawdor  are not
those in commission yet return d 


malcolm

my liege 
they are not yet come back  but i have spoke
with one that saw him die  who did report
that very frankly he confess his treasons 
implored your highness  pardon and set forth
a deep repentance  nothing in his life
became him like the leaving it  he died
as one that had been studied in his death
to throw away the dearest thing he owed 
as  a careless trifle 


duncan

there no art
to find the mind construction in the face 
he was a gentleman on whom i built
an absolute trust 
enter macbeth  banquo  ross  and angus
o worthiest cousin 
the sin of my ingratitude even now
was heavy on me  thou art so far before
that swiftest wing of recompense is slow
to overtake thee  would thou hadst less deserved 
that the proportion both of thanks and payment
might have been mine  only i have left to say 
more is thy due than more than all can pay 


macbeth

the service and the loyalty i owe 
in doing it  pays itself  your highness  part
is to receive our duties  and our duties
are to your throne and state children and servants 
which do but what they should  by doing every thing
safe toward your love and honour 


duncan

welcome hither 
i have begun to plant thee  and will labour
to make thee full of growing  noble banquo 
that hast no less deserved  nor must be known
no less to have done so  let me enfold thee
and hold thee to my heart 


banquo

there if i grow 
the harvest is your own 


duncan

my plenteous joys 
wanton in fulness  seek to hide themselves
in drops of sorrow  sons  kinsmen  thanes 
and you whose places are the nearest  know
we will establish our estate upon
our eldest  malcolm  whom we name hereafter
the prince of cumberland  which honour must
not unaccompanied invest him only 
but signs of nobleness  like stars  shall shine
on all deservers  from hence to inverness 
and bind us further to you 


macbeth

the rest is labour  which is not used for you 
i be myself the harbinger and make joyful
the hearing of my wife with your approach 
so humbly take my leave 


duncan

my worthy cawdor 


macbeth

 aside   the prince of cumberland  that is a step
on which i must fall down  or else o erleap 
for in my way it lies  stars  hide your fires 
let not light see my black and deep desires 
the eye wink at the hand  yet let that be 
which the eye fears  when it is done  to see 
exit


duncan

true  worthy banquo  he is full so valiant 
and in his commendations i am fed 
it is a banquet to me  let after him 
whose care is gone before to bid us welcome 
it is a peerless kinsman 
flourish  exeunt
