enter lady macbeth  reading a letter


lady macbeth

 met me in the day of success  and i have
learned by the perfectest report  they have more in
them than mortal knowledge  when i burned in desire
to question them further  they made themselves air 
into which they vanished  whiles i stood rapt in
the wonder of it  came missives from the king  who
all hailed me  of cawdor  by which title 
before  these weird sisters saluted me  and referred
me to the coming on of time  with  hail  king that
shalt be  this have i thought good to deliver
thee  my dearest partner of greatness  that thou
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing  by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee  lay it
to thy heart  and farewell 
glamis thou art  and cawdor  and shalt be
what thou art promised  yet do i fear thy nature 
it is too full o  the milk of human kindness
to catch the nearest way  thou wouldst be great 
art not without ambition  but without
the illness should attend it  what thou wouldst highly 
that wouldst thou holily  wouldst not play false 
and yet wouldst wrongly win  thou have  great glamis 
that which cries  thou must do  if thou have it 
and that which rather thou dost fear to do
than wishest should be undone  hie thee hither 
that i may pour my spirits in thine ear 
and chastise with the valour of my tongue
all that impedes thee from the golden round 
which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
to have thee crown withal 
enter a messenger
what is your tidings 


messenger

the king comes here to night 


lady macbeth

thou mad to say it 
is not thy master with him  who  were so 
would have inform for preparation 


messenger

so please you  it is true  our thane is coming 
one of my fellows had the speed of him 
who  almost dead for breath  had scarcely more
than would make up his message 


lady macbeth

give him tending 
he brings great news 
exit messenger
the raven himself is hoarse
that croaks the fatal entrance of duncan
under my battlements  come  you spirits
that tend on mortal thoughts  unsex me here 
and fill me from the crown to the toe top full
of direst cruelty  make thick my blood 
stop up the access and passage to remorse 
that no compunctious visitings of nature
shake my fell purpose  nor keep peace between
the effect and it  come to my woman breasts 
and take my milk for gall  you murdering ministers 
wherever in your sightless substances
you wait on nature mischief  come  thick night 
and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell 
that my keen knife see not the wound it makes 
nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark 
to cry  hold  hold 
enter macbeth
great glamis  worthy cawdor 
greater than both  by the all hail hereafter 
thy letters have transported me beyond
this ignorant present  and i feel now
the future in the instant 


macbeth

my dearest love 
duncan comes here to night 


lady macbeth

and when goes hence 


macbeth

to morrow  as he purposes 


lady macbeth

o  never
shall sun that morrow see 
your face  my thane  is as a book where men
may read strange matters  to beguile the time 
look like the time  bear welcome in your eye 
your hand  your tongue  look like the innocent flower 
but be the serpent under t  he that coming
must be provided for  and you shall put
this night great business into my dispatch 
which shall to all our nights and days to come
give solely sovereign sway and masterdom 


macbeth

we will speak further 


lady macbeth

only look up clear 
to alter favour ever is to fear 
leave all the rest to me
