duncan

this castle hath a pleasant seat  the air
nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
unto our gentle senses 


banquo

this guest of summer 
the temple haunting martlet  does approve 
by his loved mansionry  that the heaven breath
smells wooingly here  no jutty  frieze 
buttress  nor coign of vantage  but this bird
hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle 
where they most breed and haunt  i have observed 
the air is delicate 
enter lady macbeth


duncan

see  see  our honour hostess 
the love that follows us sometime is our trouble 
which still we thank as love  herein i teach you
how you shall bid god  us for your pains 
and thank us for your trouble 


lady macbeth

all our service
in every point twice done and then done double
were poor and single business to contend
against those honours deep and broad wherewith
your majesty loads our house  for those of old 
and the late dignities heap up to them 
we rest your hermits 


duncan

where the thane of cawdor 
we coursed him at the heels  and had a purpose
to be his purveyor  but he rides well 
and his great love  sharp as his spur  hath holp him
to his home before us  fair and noble hostess 
we are your guest to night 


lady macbeth

your servants ever
have theirs  themselves and what is theirs  in compt 
to make their audit at your highness  pleasure 
still to return your own 


duncan

give me your hand 
conduct me to mine host  we love him highly 
and shall continue our graces towards him 
by your leave  hostess
