hautboys and torches  enter a sewer  and divers  servants with dishes and service  and pass over the stage  then enter macbeth

if it were done when  done  then  well
it were done quickly  if the assassination
could trammel up the consequence  and catch
with his surcease success  that but this blow
might be the be all and the end all here 
but here  upon this bank and shoal of time 
we jump the life to come  but in these cases
we still have judgment here  that we but teach
bloody instructions  which  being taught  return
to plague the inventor  this even handed justice
commends the ingredients of our poison chalice
to our own lips  he here in double trust 
first  as i am his kinsman and his subject 
strong both against the deed  then  as his host 
who should against his murderer shut the door 
not bear the knife myself  besides  this duncan
hath borne his faculties so meek  hath been
so clear in his great office  that his virtues
will plead like angels  trumpet tongued  against
the deep damnation of his taking off 
and pity  like a naked new born babe 
striding the blast  or heaven cherubim  horsed
upon the sightless couriers of the air 
shall blow the horrid deed in every eye 
that tears shall drown the wind  i have no spur
to prick the sides of my intent  but only
vaulting ambition  which o itself
and falls on the other 
enter lady macbeth
how now  what news 


lady macbeth

he has almost supp d  why have you left the chamber 


macbeth

hath he ask for me 


lady macbeth

know you not he has 


macbeth

we will proceed no further in this business 
he hath honour me of late  and i have bought
golden opinions from all sorts of people 
which would be worn now in their newest gloss 
not cast aside so soon 


lady macbeth

was the hope drunk
wherein you dress yourself  hath it slept since 
and wakes it now  to look so green and pale
at what it did so freely  from this time
such i account thy love  art thou afeard
to be the same in thine own act and valour
as thou art in desire  wouldst thou have that
which thou esteem the ornament of life 
and live a coward in thine own esteem 
letting  dare not  wait upon  would 
like the poor cat i  the adage 


macbeth

prithee  peace 
i dare do all that may become a man 
who dares do more is none 


lady macbeth

what beast was t  then 
that made you break this enterprise to me 
when you durst do it  then you were a man 
and  to be more than what you were  you would
be so much more the man  nor time nor place
did then adhere  and yet you would make both 
they have made themselves  and that their fitness now
does unmake you  i have given suck  and know
how tender  to love the babe that milks me 
i would  while it was smiling in my face 
have pluck my nipple from his boneless gums 
and dash the brains out  had i so sworn as you
have done to this 


macbeth

                  if we should fail 


lady macbeth

we fail 
but screw your courage to the sticking place 
and we not fail  when duncan is asleep 
whereto the rather shall his day hard journey
soundly invite him his two chamberlains
will i with wine and wassail so convince
that memory  the warder of the brain 
shall be a fume  and the receipt of reason
a limbeck only  when in swinish sleep
their drenched natures lie as in a death 
what cannot you and i perform upon
the unguarded duncan  what not put upon
his spongy officers  who shall bear the guilt
of our great quell 


macbeth

bring forth men children only 
for thy undaunted mettle should compose
nothing but males  will it not be received 
when we have mark with blood those sleepy two
of his own chamber and used their very daggers 
that they have done t 


lady macbeth

who dares receive it other 
as we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
upon his death 


macbeth

                  i am settled  and bend up
each corporal agent to this terrible feat 
away  and mock the time with fairest show 
false face must hide what the false heart doth know
