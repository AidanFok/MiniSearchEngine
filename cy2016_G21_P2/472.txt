scene i  court of macbeth castle 


enter banquo  and fleance bearing a torch before him


banquo

how goes the night  boy 


fleance

the moon is down  i have not heard the clock 


banquo

and she goes down at twelve 


fleance

i take t   later  sir 


banquo

hold  take my sword  there husbandry in heaven 
their candles are all out  take thee that too 
a heavy summons lies like lead upon me 
and yet i would not sleep  merciful powers 
restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
gives way to in repose 
enter macbeth  and a servant with a torch
give me my sword 
who there 


macbeth

a friend 


banquo

what  sir  not yet at rest  the king a bed 
he hath been in unusual pleasure  and
sent forth great largess to your offices 
this diamond he greets your wife withal 
by the name of most kind hostess  and shut up
in measureless content 


macbeth

being unprepared 
our will became the servant to defect 
which else should free have wrought 


banquo

all well 
i dreamt last night of the three weird sisters 
to you they have show some truth 


macbeth

i think not of them 
yet  when we can entreat an hour to serve 
we would spend it in some words upon that business 
if you would grant the time 


banquo

at your kind leisure 


macbeth

if you shall cleave to my consent  when  tis 
it shall make honour for you 


banquo

so i lose none
in seeking to augment it  but still keep
my bosom franchised and allegiance clear 
i shall be counsell d 


macbeth

good repose the while 


banquo

thanks  sir  the like to you 
exeunt banquo and fleance


macbeth

go bid thy mistress  when my drink is ready 
she strike upon the bell  get thee to bed 
exit servant
is this a dagger which i see before me 
the handle toward my hand  come  let me clutch thee 
i have thee not  and yet i see thee still 
art thou not  fatal vision  sensible
to feeling as to sight  or art thou but
a dagger of the mind  a false creation 
proceeding from the heat oppressed brain 
i see thee yet  in form as palpable
as this which now i draw 
thou marshall me the way that i was going 
and such an instrument i was to use 
mine eyes are made the fools o  the other senses 
or else worth all the rest  i see thee still 
and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood 
which was not so before  there no such thing 
it is the bloody business which informs
thus to mine eyes  now o the one halfworld
nature seems dead  and wicked dreams abuse
the curtain sleep  witchcraft celebrates
pale hecate offerings  and wither murder 
alarum by his sentinel  the wolf 
whose howl his watch  thus with his stealthy pace 
with tarquin ravishing strides  towards his design
moves like a ghost  thou sure and firm set earth 
hear not my steps  which way they walk  for fear
thy very stones prate of my whereabout 
and take the present horror from the time 
which now suits with it  whiles i threat  he lives 
words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives 
a bell rings
i go  and it is done  the bell invites me 
hear it not  duncan  for it is a knell
that summons thee to heaven or to hell 
exit
