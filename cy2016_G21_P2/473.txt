scene ii  the same 


enter lady macbeth


lady macbeth

that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold 
what hath quench them hath given me fire 
hark  peace 
it was the owl that shriek d  the fatal bellman 
which gives the stern good night  he is about it 
the doors are open  and the surfeited grooms
do mock their charge with snores  i have drugg 
their possets 
that death and nature do contend about them 
whether they live or die 


macbeth

 within   who there  what  ho 


lady macbeth

alack  i am afraid they have awaked 
and  not done  the attempt and not the deed
confounds us  hark  i laid their daggers ready 
he could not miss  em  had he not resembled
my father as he slept  i had done t 
enter macbeth
my husband 


macbeth

i have done the deed  didst thou not hear a noise 


lady macbeth

i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry 
did not you speak 


macbeth

                  when 


lady macbeth

now 


macbeth

as i descended 


lady macbeth

ay 


macbeth

hark 
who lies i  the second chamber 


lady macbeth

donalbain 


macbeth

this is a sorry sight 
looking on his hands


lady macbeth

a foolish thought  to say a sorry sight 


macbeth

there one did laugh in sleep  and one cried
 murder 
that they did wake each other  i stood and heard them 
but they did say their prayers  and address them
again to sleep 


lady macbeth

                  there are two lodged together 


macbeth

one cried  bless us  and  amen  the other 
as they had seen me with these hangman hands 
listening their fear  i could not say  amen 
when they did say  bless us 


lady macbeth

consider it not so deeply 


macbeth

but wherefore could not i pronounce  amen 
i had most need of blessing  and  amen 
stuck in my throat 


lady macbeth

these deeds must not be thought
after these ways  so  it will make us mad 


macbeth

methought i heard a voice cry  no more 
macbeth does murder sleep  the innocent sleep 
sleep that knits up the ravell sleeve of care 
the death of each day life  sore labour bath 
balm of hurt minds  great nature second course 
chief nourisher in life feast 


lady macbeth

what do you mean 


macbeth

still it cried  no more  to all the house 
 hath murder sleep  and therefore cawdor
shall sleep no more  macbeth shall sleep no more 


lady macbeth

who was it that thus cried  why  worthy thane 
you do unbend your noble strength  to think
so brainsickly of things  go get some water 
and wash this filthy witness from your hand 
why did you bring these daggers from the place 
they must lie there  go carry them  and smear
the sleepy grooms with blood 


macbeth

i go no more 
i am afraid to think what i have done 
look on again i dare not 


lady macbeth

infirm of purpose 
give me the daggers  the sleeping and the dead
are but as pictures   the eye of childhood
that fears a painted devil  if he do bleed 
i gild the faces of the grooms withal 
for it must seem their guilt 
exit  knocking within


macbeth

whence is that knocking 
how is with me  when every noise appals me 
what hands are here  ha  they pluck out mine eyes 
will all great neptune ocean wash this blood
clean from my hand  no  this my hand will rather
the multitudinous seas in incarnadine 
making the green one red 
re enter lady macbeth


lady macbeth

my hands are of your colour  but i shame
to wear a heart so white 
knocking within
i hear a knocking
at the south entry  retire we to our chamber 
a little water clears us of this deed 
how easy is it  then  your constancy
hath left you unattended 
knocking within
hark  more knocking 
get on your nightgown  lest occasion call us 
and show us to be watchers  be not lost
so poorly in your thoughts 


macbeth

to know my deed   best not know myself 
knocking within
wake duncan with thy knocking  i would thou couldst 
exeunt
