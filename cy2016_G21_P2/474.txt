porter

 sir  we were carousing till the
second cock  and drink  sir  is a great
provoker of three things 


macduff

what three things does drink especially provoke 


porter

marry  sir  nose painting  sleep  and
urine  lechery  sir  it provokes  and unprovokes 
it provokes the desire  but it takes
away the performance  therefore  much drink
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery 
it makes him  and it mars him  it sets
him on  and it takes him off  it persuades him 
and disheartens him  makes him stand to  and
not stand to  in conclusion  equivocates him
in a sleep  and  giving him the lie  leaves him 


macduff

i believe drink gave thee the lie last night 


porter

that it did  sir  i  the very throat on
me  but i requited him for his lie  and  i
think  being too strong for him  though he took
up my legs sometime  yet i made a shift to cast
him

lennox

the night has been unruly  where we lay 
our chimneys were blown down  and  as they say 
lamentings heard i  the air  strange screams of death 
and prophesying with accents terrible
of dire combustion and confused events
new hatch to the woeful time  the obscure bird
clamour the livelong night  some say  the earth
was feverous and did shake 


macbeth

 a rough night 


lennox

my young remembrance cannot parallel
a fellow to it

re enter macbeth and lennox  with ross


macbeth

had i but died an hour before this chance 
i had lived a blessed time  for  from this instant 
there  nothing serious in mortality 
all is but toys  renown and grace is dead 
the wine of life is drawn  and the mere lees
is left this vault to brag of 
enter malcolm and donalbain


donalbain

what is amiss

o  by whom 


lennox

those of his chamber  as it seem d  had done  t 
their hands and faces were an badged with blood 
so were their daggers  which unwiped we found
upon their pillows 
they stared  and were distracted  no man life
was to be trusted with them 


macbeth

o  yet i do repent me of my fury 
that i did kill them 


macduff

wherefore did you so 


macbeth

who can be wise  amazed  temperate and furious 
loyal and neutral  in a moment  no man 
the expedition my violent love
outrun the pauser  reason  here lay duncan 
his silver skin laced with his golden blood 
and his gash stabs look like a breach in nature
for ruin wasteful entrance  there  the murderers 
steep in the colours of their trade  their daggers
unmannerly breech with gore  who could refrain 
that had a heart to love  and in that heart
courage to make  love kno wn 


lady macbeth

help me hence  ho 


macduff

look to the lady 


malcolm

 aside to donalbain   why do we hold our tongues 
that most may claim this argument for ours 


donalbain

 aside to malcolm   what should be spoken here 
where our fate 
hid in an auger hole  may rush  and seize us 
let  away 
our tears are not yet brew d 


malcolm

 aside to donalbain         nor our strong sorrow
upon the foot of motion 


banquo

look to the lady 
lady macbeth is carried out
and when we have our naked frailties hid 
that suffer in exposure  let us meet 
and question this most bloody piece of work 
to know it further  fears and scruples shake us 
in the great hand of god i stand  and thence
against the undivulged pretence i fight
of treasonous malice 


macduff

and so do i 


all

so all 


macbeth

let briefly put on manly readiness 
and meet i  the hall together 


all

well contented 
exeunt all but malcolm and donalbain 


malcolm

what will you do  let not consort with them 
to show an unfelt sorrow is an office
which the false man does easy  i to england 


donalbain

to ireland  i  our separated fortune
shall keep us both the safer  where we are 
there daggers in men smiles  the near in blood 
the nearer bloody 


malcolm

                  this murderous shaft that shot
hath not yet lighted  and our safest way
is to avoid the aim  therefore  to horse 
and let us not be dainty of leave taking 
but shift away  there warrant in that theft
which steals itself  when there no mercy left
