scene iv  outside macbeth castle 


enter ross and an old man


old man

threescore and ten i can remember well 
within the volume of which time i have seen
hours dreadful and things strange  but this sore night
hath trifled former knowings 


ross

ah  good father 
thou seest  the heavens  as troubled with man act 
threaten his bloody stage  by the clock   day 
and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp 
is night predominance  or the day shame 
that darkness does the face of earth entomb 
when living light should kiss it 


old man

 unnatural 
even like the deed that done  on tuesday last 
a falcon  towering in her pride of place 
was by a mousing owl hawk at and kill d 


ross

and duncan horses a thing most strange and certain 
beauteous and swift  the minions of their race 
turn wild in nature  broke their stalls  flung out 
contending  obedience  as they would make
war with mankind 


old man

 said they eat each other 


ross

they did so  to the amazement of mine eyes
that look upon t  here comes the good macduff 
enter macduff
how goes the world  sir  now 


macduff

why  see you not 


ross

is known who did this more than bloody deed 


macduff

those that macbeth hath slain 


ross

alas  the day 
what good could they pretend 


macduff

they were suborn d 
malcolm and donalbain  the king two sons 
are stol away and fled  which puts upon them
suspicion of the deed 


ross

 nature still 
thriftless ambition  that wilt ravin up
thine own life means  then  most like
the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth 


macduff

he is already named  and gone to scone
to be invested 


ross

                  where is duncan body 


macduff

carried to colmekill 
the sacred storehouse of his predecessors 
and guardian of their bones 


ross

will you to scone 


macduff

no  cousin  i to fife 


ross

well  i will thither 


macduff

well  may you see things well done there  adieu 
lest our old robes sit easier than our new 


ross

farewell  father 


old man

god benison go with you  and with those
that would make good of bad  and friends of foes 
exeunt
