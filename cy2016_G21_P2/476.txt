banquo

thou hast it now  king  cawdor  glamis  all 
as the weird women promised  and  i fear 
thou play most foully for t  yet it was said
it should not stand in thy posterity 
but that myself should be the root and father
of many kings  if there come truth from them 
as upon thee  macbeth  their speeches shine 
why  by the verities on thee made good 
may they not be my oracles as well 
and set me up in hope  but hush  no more 
sennet sounded  enter macbeth  as king  lady  macbeth  as queen  lennox  ross  lords  ladies  and attendants


macbeth

and all thing unbecoming 


macbeth

and i request your presence 


banquo

command upon me  to the which my duties
are with a most indissoluble tie
for ever knit 


macbeth

banquo

ay  my good lord 


macbeth

we should have else desired your good advice 
which still hath been both grave and prosperous 
in this day council  but we take to morrow 
is far you ride 


banquo

as far  my lord  as will fill up the time
 this and supper  go not my horse the better 
i must become a borrower of the night
for a dark hour or twain 


macbeth

fail not our feast 


banquo

my lord  i will not 


macbeth

we hear  our bloody cousins are bestow 
in england and in ireland  not confessing
their cruel parricide  filling their hearers
with strange invention  but of that to morrow 
when therewithal we shall have cause of state
craving us jointly  hie you to horse  adieu 
till you return at night  goes fleance with you 


banquo

ay  my good lord  our time does call upon  s 


macbeth

i wish your horses swift and sure of foot 
and so i do commend you to their backs  farewell 
exit banquo
let every man be master of his time
till seven at night  to make society
the sweeter welcome  we will keep ourself
till supper time alone  while then  god be with you 
exeunt all but macbeth  and an attendant
sirrah  a word with you  attend those men
our pleasure 


attendant

they are  my lord  without the palace gate 


macbeth

bring them before us 
exit attendant
to be thus is nothing 
but to be safely thus our fears in banquo
stick deep  and in his royalty of nature
reigns that which would be fear d   much he dares 
and  to that dauntless temper of his mind 
he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
to act in safety  there is none but he
whose being i do fear  and  under him 
my genius is rebuked  as  it is said 
mark antony was by caesar  he chid the sisters
when first they put the name of king upon me 
and bade them speak to him  then prophet like
they hail him father to a line of kings 
upon my head they placed a fruitless crown 
and put a barren sceptre in my gripe 
thence to be wrench with an unlineal hand 
no son of mine succeeding  if  be so 
for banquo issue have i filed my mind 
for them the gracious duncan have i murder d 
put rancours in the vessel of my peace
only for them  and mine eternal jewel
given to the common enemy of man 
to make them kings  the seed of banquo kings 
rather than so  come fate into the list 
and champion me to the utterance  who there 
re enter attendant  with two murderers
now go to the door  and stay there till we call 
exit attendant
was it not yesterday we spoke together 


first murderer

it was  so please your highness 


macbeth

well then  now
have you consider of my speeches  know
that it was he in the times past which held you
so under fortune  which you thought had been
our innocent self  this i made good to you
in our last conference  pass in probation with you 
how you were borne in hand  how cross d 
the instruments 
who wrought with them  and all things else that might
to half a soul and to a notion crazed
say  did banquo 


first murderer

you made it known to us 


macbeth

i did so  and went further  which is now
our point of second meeting  do you find
your patience so predominant in your nature
that you can let this go  are you so gospell 
to pray for this good man and for his issue 
whose heavy hand hath bow you to the grave
and beggar yours for ever 


first murderer

we are men  my liege 


macbeth

ay  in the catalogue ye go for men 
as hounds and greyhounds  mongrels  spaniels  curs 
shoughs  water rugs and demi wolves  are clept
all by the name of dogs  the valued file
distinguishes the swift  the slow  the subtle 
the housekeeper  the hunter  every one
according to the gift which bounteous nature
hath in him closed  whereby he does receive
particular addition  from the bill
that writes them all alike  and so of men 
now  if you have a station in the file 
not i  the worst rank of manhood  say  t 
and i will put that business in your bosoms 
whose execution takes your enemy off 
grapples you to the heart and love of us 
who wear our health but sickly in his life 
which in his death were perfect 


second murderer

i am one  my liege 
whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
have so incensed that i am reckless what
i do to spite the world 


first murderer

and i another
so weary with disasters  tugg with fortune 
that i would set my lie on any chance 
to mend it  or be rid on t 


macbeth

both of you
know banquo was your enemy 


both murderers

true  my lord 


macbeth

so is he mine  and in such bloody distance 
that every minute of his being thrusts
against my near of life  and though i could
with barefaced power sweep him from my sight
and bid my will avouch it  yet i must not 
for certain friends that are both his and mine 
whose loves i may not drop  but wail his fall
who i myself struck down  and thence it is 
that i to your assistance do make love 
masking the business from the common eye
for sundry weighty reasons 


second murderer

we shall  my lord 
perform what you command us 


first murderer

though our lives 


macbeth

your spirits shine through you  within this hour at most
i will advise you where to plant yourselves 
acquaint you with the perfect spy o  the time 
the moment on t  for must be done to night 
and something from the palace  always thought
that i require a clearness  and with him 
to leave no rubs nor botches in the work 
fleance his son  that keeps him company 
whose absence is no less material to me
than is his father s  must embrace the fate
of that dark hour  resolve yourselves apart 
i come to you anon 


both murderers

we are resolved  my lord 


macbeth

i call upon you straight  abide within 
exeunt murderers
it is concluded  banquo  thy soul flight 
if it find heaven  must find it out to night 
exit
