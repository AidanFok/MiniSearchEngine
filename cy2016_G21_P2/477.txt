scene ii  the palace 


enter lady macbeth and a servant


lady macbeth

is banquo gone from court 


servant

ay  madam  but returns again to night 


lady macbeth

say to the king  i would attend his leisure
for a few words 


servant

                  madam  i will 
exit


lady macbeth

nought had  all spent 
where our desire is got without content 
 safer to be that which we destroy
than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy 
enter macbeth
how now  my lord  why do you keep alone 
of sorriest fancies your companions making 
using those thoughts which should indeed have died
with them they think on  things without all remedy
should be without regard  what done is done 


macbeth

we have scotch the snake  not kill it 
she close and be herself  whilst our poor malice
remains in danger of her former tooth 
but let the frame of things disjoint  both the
worlds suffer 
ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
in the affliction of these terrible dreams
that shake us nightly  better be with the dead 
whom we  to gain our peace  have sent to peace 
than on the torture of the mind to lie
in restless ecstasy  duncan is in his grave 
after life fitful fever he sleeps well 
treason has done his worst  nor steel  nor poison 
malice domestic  foreign levy  nothing 
can touch him further 


lady macbeth

come on 
gentle my lord  sleek o your rugged looks 
be bright and jovial among your guests to night 


macbeth

so shall i  love  and so  i pray  be you 
let your remembrance apply to banquo 
present him eminence  both with eye and tongue 
unsafe the while  that we
must lave our honours in these flattering streams 
and make our faces vizards to our hearts 
disguising what they are 


lady macbeth

you must leave this 


macbeth

o  full of scorpions is my mind  dear wife 
thou know that banquo  and his fleance  lives 


lady macbeth

but in them nature copy not eterne 


macbeth

there comfort yet  they are assailable 
then be thou jocund  ere the bat hath flown
his cloister flight  ere to black hecate summons
the shard borne beetle with his drowsy hums
hath rung night yawning peal  there shall be done
a deed of dreadful note 


lady macbeth

what to be done 


macbeth

be innocent of the knowledge  dearest chuck 
till thou applaud the deed  come  seeling night 
scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day 
and with thy bloody and invisible hand
cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
which keeps me pale  light thickens  and the crow
makes wing to the rooky wood 
good things of day begin to droop and drowse 
while night black agents to their preys do rouse 
thou marvell at my words  but hold thee still 
things bad begun make strong themselves by ill 
so  prithee  go with me 
exeunt
