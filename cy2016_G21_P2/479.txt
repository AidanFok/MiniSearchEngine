and health on both

macbeth

here had we now our country honour roof d 
were the graced person of our banquo present

than pity for mischance 


ross

his absence  sir 
lays blame upon his promise  please your highness
to grace us with your royal company 


macbeth

the table full 


lennox

                  here is a place reserved  sir

where 


lennox

here  my good lord  what is that moves your highness 


macbeth

which of you have done this 


lords

what  my good lord 


macbeth

thou canst not say i did it  never shake
thy gory locks at me 


ross

gentlemen  rise  his highness is not well 


lady macbeth

sit  worthy friends  my lord is often thus 
and hath been from his youth  pray you  keep seat 
the fit is momentary  upon a thought
he will again be well  if much you note him 
you shall offend him and extend his passion 
feed  and regard him not  are you a man 


macbeth

ay  and a bold one  that dare look on that
which might appal the devil 


lady macbeth

o proper stuff 
this is the very painting of your fear 
this is the air drawn dagger which  you said 
led you to duncan  o  these flaws and starts 
impostors to true fear  would well become
a woman story at a winter fire 
authorized by her grandam  shame itself 
why do you make such faces  when all done 
you look but on a stool 


macbeth

prithee  see there  behold  look  lo 
how say you 
why  what care i  if thou canst nod  speak too 
if charnel houses and our graves must send
those that we bury back  our monuments
shall be the maws of kites 
ghost of banquo vanishes


lady macbeth

what  quite unmann in folly 


macbeth

if i stand here  i saw him 


lady macbeth

fie  for shame 


macbeth

blood hath been shed ere now  i  the olden time 
ere human statute purged the gentle weal 
ay  and since too  murders have been perform 
too terrible for the ear  the times have been 
that  when the brains were out  the man would die 
and there an end  but now they rise again 
with twenty mortal murders on their crowns 
and push us from our stools  this is more strange
than such a murder is 


lady macbeth

my worthy lord 
your noble friends do lack you 


macbeth

i do forget 
do not muse at me  my most worthy friends 
i have a strange infirmity  which is nothing
to those that know me  come  love and health to all 
then i sit down  give me some wine  fill full 
i drink to the general joy o  the whole table 
and to our dear friend banquo  whom we miss 
would he were here  to all  and him  we thirst 
and all to all 


lords

                  our duties  and the pledge 
re enter ghost of banquo


macbeth

avaunt  and quit my sight  let the earth hide thee 
thy bones are marrowless  thy blood is cold 
thou hast no speculation in those eyes
which thou dost glare with 


lady macbeth

think of this  good peers 
but as a thing of custom   no other 
only it spoils the pleasure of the time 


macbeth

what man dare  i dare 
approach thou like the rugged russian bear 
the arm rhinoceros  or the hyrcan tiger 
take any shape but that  and my firm nerves
shall never tremble  or be alive again 
and dare me to the desert with thy sword 
if trembling i inhabit then  protest me
the baby of a girl  hence  horrible shadow 
unreal mockery  hence 
ghost of banquo vanishes
why  so  being gone 
i am a man again  pray you  sit still 


lady macbeth

you have displaced the mirth  broke the good meeting 
with most admired disorder 


macbeth

can such things be 
and overcome us like a summer cloud 
without our special wonder  you make me strange
even to the disposition that i owe 
when now i think you can behold such sights 
and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks 
when mine is blanched with fear 


ross

what sights  my lord 


lady macbeth

i pray you  speak not  he grows worse and worse 
question enrages him  at once  good night 
stand not upon the order of your going 
but go at once 


lennox

                  good night  and better health
attend his majesty 


lady macbeth

a kind good night to all 
exeunt all but macbeth and lady macbeth


macbeth

it will have blood  they say  blood will have blood 
stones have been known to move and trees to speak 
augurs and understood relations have
by magot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
the secret man of blood  what is the night 


lady macbeth

almost at odds with morning  which is which 


macbeth

how say thou  that macduff denies his person
at our great bidding 


lady macbeth

did you send to him  sir 


macbeth

i hear it by the way  but i will send 
there not a one of them but in his house
i keep a servant fee d  i will to morrow 
and betimes i will  to the weird sisters 
more shall they speak  for now i am bent to know 
by the worst means  the worst  for mine own good 
all causes shall give way  i am in blood
stepp in so far that  should i wade no more 
returning were as tedious as go o er 
strange things i have in head  that will to hand 
which must be acted ere they may be scann d 


lady macbeth

you lack the season of all natures  sleep 


macbeth

come  we to sleep  my strange and self abuse
is the initiate fear that wants hard use 
we are yet but young in deed 
exeunt
