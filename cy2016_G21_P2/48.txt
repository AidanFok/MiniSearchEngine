scene iii  york  the archbishop palace 


enter the archbishop of york  the lords hastings  mowbray  and bardolph


archbishop of york

thus have you heard our cause and known our means 
and  my most noble friends  i pray you all 
speak plainly your opinions of our hopes 
and first  lord marshal  what say you to it 


mowbray

i well allow the occasion of our arms 
but gladly would be better satisfied
how in our means we should advance ourselves
to look with forehead bold and big enough
upon the power and puissance of the king 


hastings

our present musters grow upon the file
to five and twenty thousand men of choice 
and our supplies live largely in the hope
of great northumberland  whose bosom burns
with an incensed fire of injuries 


lord bardolph

the question then  lord hastings  standeth thus 
whether our present five and twenty thousand
may hold up head without northumberland 


hastings

with him  we may 


lord bardolph

                  yea  marry  there the point 
but if without him we be thought too feeble 
my judgment is  we should not step too far
till we had his assistance by the hand 
for in a theme so bloody faced as this
conjecture  expectation  and surmise
of aids incertain should not be admitted 


archbishop of york

 very true  lord bardolph  for indeed
it was young hotspur case at shrewsbury 


lord bardolph

it was  my lord  who lined himself with hope 
eating the air on promise of supply 
flattering himself in project of a power
much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts 
and so  with great imagination
proper to madmen  led his powers to death
and winking leap into destruction 


hastings

but  by your leave  it never yet did hurt
to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope 


lord bardolph

yes  if this present quality of war 
indeed the instant action  a cause on foot
lives so in hope as in an early spring
we see the appearing buds  which to prove fruit 
hope gives not so much warrant as despair
that frosts will bite them  when we mean to build 
we first survey the plot  then draw the model 
and when we see the figure of the house 
then must we rate the cost of the erection 
which if we find outweighs ability 
what do we then but draw anew the model
in fewer offices  or at last desist
to build at all  much more  in this great work 
which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
and set another up  should we survey
the plot of situation and the model 
consent upon a sure foundation 
question surveyors  know our own estate 
how able such a work to undergo 
to weigh against his opposite  or else
we fortify in paper and in figures 
using the names of men instead of men 
like one that draws the model of a house
beyond his power to build it  who  half through 
gives o and leaves his part created cost
a naked subject to the weeping clouds
and waste for churlish winter tyranny 


hastings

grant that our hopes  yet likely of fair birth 
should be still born  and that we now possess 
the utmost man of expectation 
i think we are a body strong enough 
even as we are  to equal with the king 


lord bardolph

what  is the king but five and twenty thousand 


hastings

to us no more  nay  not so much  lord bardolph 
for his divisions  as the times do brawl 
are in three heads  one power against the french 
and one against glendower  perforce a third
must take up us  so is the unfirm king
in three divided  and his coffers sound
with hollow poverty and emptiness 


archbishop of york

that he should draw his several strengths together
and come against us in full puissance 
need not be dreaded 


hastings

if he should do so 
he leaves his back unarm d  the french and welsh
baying him at the heels  never fear that 


lord bardolph

who is it like should lead his forces hither 


hastings

the duke of lancaster and westmoreland 
against the welsh  himself and harry monmouth 
but who is substituted  the french 
i have no certain notice 


archbishop of york

let us on 
and publish the occasion of our arms 
the commonwealth is sick of their own choice 
their over greedy love hath surfeited 
an habitation giddy and unsure
hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart 
o thou fond many  with what loud applause
didst thou beat heaven with blessing bolingbroke 
before he was what thou wouldst have him be 
and being now trimm in thine own desires 
thou  beastly feeder  art so full of him 
that thou provokest thyself to cast him up 
so  so  thou common dog  didst thou disgorge
thy glutton bosom of the royal richard 
and now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up 
and howl to find it  what trust is in
these times 
they that  when richard lived  would have him die 
are now become enamour on his grave 
thou  that threw dust upon his goodly head
when through proud london he came sighing on
after the admired heels of bolingbroke 
criest now  earth  yield us that king again 
and take thou this  o thoughts of men accursed 
past and to come seems best  things present worst 


mowbray

shall we go draw our numbers and set on 


hastings

we are time subjects  and time bids be gone 
exeunt
