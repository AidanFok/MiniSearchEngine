scene v  a heath 


thunder  enter the three witches meeting hecate


first witch

why  how now  hecate  you look angerly 


hecate

have i not reason  beldams as you are 
saucy and overbold  how did you dare
to trade and traffic with macbeth
in riddles and affairs of death 
and i  the mistress of your charms 
the close contriver of all harms 
was never call to bear my part 
or show the glory of our art 
and  which is worse  all you have done
hath been but for a wayward son 
spiteful and wrathful  who  as others do 
loves for his own ends  not for you 
but make amends now  get you gone 
and at the pit of acheron
meet me i  the morning  thither he
will come to know his destiny 
your vessels and your spells provide 
your charms and every thing beside 
i am for the air  this night i spend
unto a dismal and a fatal end 
great business must be wrought ere noon 
upon the corner of the moon
there hangs a vaporous drop profound 
i catch it ere it come to ground 
and that distill by magic sleights
shall raise such artificial sprites
as by the strength of their illusion
shall draw him on to his confusion 
he shall spurn fate  scorn death  and bear
he hopes  wisdom  grace and fear 
and you all know  security
is mortals  chiefest enemy 
music and a song within   away  come away     c
hark  i am call d  my little spirit  see 
sits in a foggy cloud  and stays for me 
exit


first witch

come  let make haste  she soon be back again
