lennox

my former speeches have but hit your thoughts 
which can interpret further  only  i say 
things have been strangely borne  the
gracious duncan
was pitied of macbeth  marry  he was dead 
and the right valiant banquo walk too late 
whom  you may say  if please you  fleance kill d 
for fleance fled  men must not walk too late 
who cannot want the thought how monstrous
it was for malcolm and for donalbain
to kill their gracious father  damned fact 
how it did grieve macbeth  did he not straight
in pious rage the two delinquents tear 
that were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep 
was not that nobly done  ay  and wisely too 
for  have anger any heart alive
to hear the men deny t  so that  i say 
he has borne all things well  and i do think
that had he duncan sons under his key 
as  an please heaven  he shall not they
should find
what  to kill a father  so should fleance 
but  peace  for from broad words and  he fail 
his presence at the tyrant feast  i hear
macduff lives in disgrace  sir  can you tell
where he bestows himself 


lord

the son of duncan 
from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
lives in the english court  and is received
of the most pious edward with such grace
that the malevolence of fortune nothing
takes from his high respect  thither macduff
is gone to pray the holy king  upon his aid
to wake northumberland and warlike siward 
that  by the help of these with him above
to ratify the work we may again
give to our tables meat  sleep to our nights 
free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives 
do faithful homage and receive free honours 
all which we pine for now  and this report
hath so exasperate the king that he
prepares for some attempt of war 


lennox

sent he to macduff 


lord

he did  and with an absolute  sir  not i 
the cloudy messenger turns me his back 
and hums  as who should say  you rue the time
that clogs me with this answer 


lennox

and that well might
advise him to a caution  to hold what distance
his wisdom can provide  some holy angel
fly to the court of england and unfold
his message ere he come  that a swift blessing
may soon return to this our suffering country
under a hand accursed 


lord

i send my prayers with him
