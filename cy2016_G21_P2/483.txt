scene ii  fife  macduff castle 


enter lady macduff  her son  and ross


lady macduff

what had he done  to make him fly the land 


ross

you must have patience  madam 


lady macduff

he had none 
his flight was madness  when our actions do not 
our fears do make us traitors 


ross

you know not
whether it was his wisdom or his fear 


lady macduff

wisdom  to leave his wife  to leave his babes 
his mansion and his titles in a place
from whence himself does fly  he loves us not 
he wants the natural touch  for the poor wren 
the most diminutive of birds  will fight 
her young ones in her nest  against the owl 
all is the fear and nothing is the love 
as little is the wisdom  where the flight
so runs against all reason 


ross

my dearest coz 
i pray you  school yourself  but for your husband 
he is noble  wise  judicious  and best knows
the fits o  the season  i dare not speak
much further 
but cruel are the times  when we are traitors
and do not know ourselves  when we hold rumour
from what we fear  yet know not what we fear 
but float upon a wild and violent sea
each way and move  i take my leave of you 
shall not be long but i be here again 
things at the worst will cease  or else climb upward
to what they were before  my pretty cousin 
blessing upon you 


lady macduff

father he is  and yet he fatherless 


ross

i am so much a fool  should i stay longer 
it would be my disgrace and your discomfort 
i take my leave at once 
exit


lady macduff

sirrah  your father dead 
and what will you do now  how will you live 


son

as birds do  mother 


lady macduff

what  with worms and flies 


son

with what i get  i mean  and so do they 


lady macduff

poor bird  thou never fear the net nor lime 
the pitfall nor the gin 


son

why should i  mother  poor birds they are not set for 
my father is not dead  for all your saying 


lady macduff

yes  he is dead  how wilt thou do for a father 


son

nay  how will you do for a husband 


lady macduff

why  i can buy me twenty at any market 


son

then you buy  to sell again 


lady macduff

thou speak with all thy wit  and yet  i  faith 
with wit enough for thee 


son

was my father a traitor  mother 


lady macduff

ay  that he was 


son

what is a traitor 


lady macduff

why  one that swears and lies 


son

and be all traitors that do so 


lady macduff

every one that does so is a traitor  and must be hanged 


son

and must they all be hanged that swear and lie 


lady macduff

every one 


son

who must hang them 


lady macduff

why   the honest men 


son

then the liars and swearers are fools 
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
the honest men and hang up them 


lady macduff

now  god help thee  poor monkey 
but how wilt thou do for a father 


son

if he were dead  you weep for
him  if you would not  it were a good sign
that i should quickly have a new father 


lady macduff

poor prattler  how thou talk st 
enter a messenger


messenger

bless you  fair dame  i am not to you known 
though in your state of honour i am perfect 
i doubt some danger does approach you nearly 
if you will take a homely man advice 
be not found here  hence  with your little ones 
to fright you thus  methinks  i am too savage 
to do worse to you were fell cruelty 
which is too nigh your person  heaven preserve you 
i dare abide no longer 
exit


lady macduff

whither should i fly 
i have done no harm  but i remember now
i am in this earthly world  where to do harm
is often laudable  to do good sometime
accounted dangerous folly  why then  alas 
do i put up that womanly defence 
to say i have done no harm 
enter murderers
what are these faces 


first murderer

where is your husband 


lady macduff

i hope  in no place so unsanctified
where such as thou mayst find him 


first murderer

he a traitor 


son

thou liest  thou shag hair villain 


first murderer

what  you egg 
stabbing him
young fry of treachery 


son

he has kill me  mother 
run away  i pray you 
dies
exit lady macduff  crying  murder  exeunt murderers  following her
