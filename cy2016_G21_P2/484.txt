scene iii  england  before the king palace 


enter malcolm and macduff


malcolm

let us seek out some desolate shade  and there
weep our sad bosoms empty 


macduff

let us rather
hold fast the mortal sword  and like good men
bestride our down fall birthdom  each new morn
new widows howl  new orphans cry  new sorrows
strike heaven on the face  that it resounds
as if it felt with scotland and yell out
like syllable of dolour 


malcolm

what i believe i wail 
what know believe  and what i can redress 
as i shall find the time to friend  i will 
what you have spoke  it may be so perchance 
this tyrant  whose sole name blisters our tongues 
was once thought honest  you have loved him well 
he hath not touch you yet  i am young 
but something
you may deserve of him through me  and wisdom
to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
to appease an angry god 


macduff

i am not treacherous 


malcolm

but macbeth is 
a good and virtuous nature may recoil
in an imperial charge  but i shall crave
your pardon 
that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose 
angels are bright still  though the brightest fell 
though all things foul would wear the brows of grace 
yet grace must still look so 


macduff

i have lost my hopes 


malcolm

perchance even there where i did find my doubts 
why in that rawness left you wife and child 
those precious motives  those strong knots of love 
without leave taking  i pray you 
let not my jealousies be your dishonours 
but mine own safeties  you may be rightly just 
whatever i shall think 


macduff

bleed  bleed  poor country 
great tyranny  lay thou thy basis sure 
for goodness dare not cheque thee  wear thou
thy wrongs 
the title is affeer d  fare thee well  lord 
i would not be the villain that thou think 
for the whole space that in the tyrant grasp 
and the rich east to boot 


malcolm

be not offended 
i speak not as in absolute fear of you 
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke 
it weeps  it bleeds  and each new day a gash
is added to her wounds  i think withal
there would be hands uplifted in my right 
and here from gracious england have i offer
of goodly thousands  but  for all this 
when i shall tread upon the tyrant head 
or wear it on my sword  yet my poor country
shall have more vices than it had before 
more suffer and more sundry ways than ever 
by him that shall succeed 


macduff

what should he be 


malcolm

it is myself i mean  in whom i know
all the particulars of vice so grafted
that  when they shall be open d  black macbeth
will seem as pure as snow  and the poor state
esteem him as a lamb  being compared
with my confineless harms 


macduff

not in the legions
of horrid hell can come a devil more damn 
in evils to top macbeth 


malcolm

i grant him bloody 
luxurious  avaricious  false  deceitful 
sudden  malicious  smacking of every sin
that has a name  but there no bottom  none 
in my voluptuousness  your wives  your daughters 
your matrons and your maids  could not fill up
the cistern of my lust  and my desire
all continent impediments would o 
that did oppose my will  better macbeth
than such an one to reign 


macduff

boundless intemperance
in nature is a tyranny  it hath been
the untimely emptying of the happy throne
and fall of many kings  but fear not yet
to take upon you what is yours  you may
convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty 
and yet seem cold  the time you may so hoodwink 
we have willing dames enough  there cannot be
that vulture in you  to devour so many
as will to greatness dedicate themselves 
finding it so inclined 


malcolm

with this there grows
in my most ill composed affection such
a stanchless avarice that  were i king 
i should cut off the nobles for their lands 
desire his jewels and this other house 
and my more having would be as a sauce
to make me hunger more  that i should forge
quarrels unjust against the good and loyal 
destroying them for wealth 


macduff

this avarice
sticks deeper  grows with more pernicious root
than summer seeming lust  and it hath been
the sword of our slain kings  yet do not fear 
scotland hath foisons to fill up your will 
of your mere own  all these are portable 
with other graces weigh d 


malcolm

but i have none  the king becoming graces 
as justice  verity  temperance  stableness 
bounty  perseverance  mercy  lowliness 
devotion  patience  courage  fortitude 
i have no relish of them  but abound
in the division of each several crime 
acting it many ways  nay  had i power  i should
pour the sweet milk of concord into hell 
uproar the universal peace  confound
all unity on earth 


macduff

o scotland  scotland 


malcolm

if such a one be fit to govern  speak 
i am as i have spoken 


macduff

fit to govern 
no  not to live  o nation miserable 
with an untitled tyrant bloody scepter d 
when shalt thou see thy wholesome days again 
since that the truest issue of thy throne
by his own interdiction stands accursed 
and does blaspheme his breed  thy royal father
was a most sainted king  the queen that bore thee 
oftener upon her knees than on her feet 
died every day she lived  fare thee well 
these evils thou repeat upon thyself
have banish me from scotland  o my breast 
thy hope ends here 


malcolm

macduff  this noble passion 
child of integrity  hath from my soul
wiped the black scruples  reconciled my thoughts
to thy good truth and honour  devilish macbeth
by many of these trains hath sought to win me
into his power  and modest wisdom plucks me
from over credulous haste  but god above
deal between thee and me  for even now
i put myself to thy direction  and
unspeak mine own detraction  here abjure
the taints and blames i laid upon myself 
for strangers to my nature  i am yet
unknown to woman  never was forsworn 
scarcely have coveted what was mine own 
at no time broke my faith  would not betray
the devil to his fellow and delight
no less in truth than life  my first false speaking
was this upon myself  what i am truly 
is thine and my poor country to command 
whither indeed  before thy here approach 
old siward  with ten thousand warlike men 
already at a point  was setting forth 
now we together  and the chance of goodness
be like our warranted quarrel  why are you silent 


macduff

such welcome and unwelcome things at once
 hard to reconcile 
enter a doctor


malcolm

well  more anon comes the king forth  i pray you 


doctor

ay  sir  there are a crew of wretched souls
that stay his cure  their malady convinces
the great assay of art  but at his touch 
such sanctity hath heaven given his hand 
they presently amend 


malcolm

i thank you  doctor 
exit doctor


macduff

what the disease he means 


malcolm

 call the evil 
a most miraculous work in this good king 
which often  since my here remain in england 
i have seen him do  how he solicits heaven 
himself best knows  but strangely visited people 
all swoln and ulcerous  pitiful to the eye 
the mere despair of surgery  he cures 
hanging a golden stamp about their necks 
put on with holy prayers  and  spoken 
to the succeeding royalty he leaves
the healing benediction  with this strange virtue 
he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy 
and sundry blessings hang about his throne 
that speak him full of grace 
enter ross


macduff

see  who comes here 


malcolm

my countryman  but yet i know him not 


macduff

my ever gentle cousin  welcome hither 


malcolm

i know him now  good god  betimes remove
the means that makes us strangers 


ross

sir  amen 


macduff

stands scotland where it did 


ross

alas  poor country 
almost afraid to know itself  it cannot
be call our mother  but our grave  where nothing 
but who knows nothing  is once seen to smile 
where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
are made  not mark d  where violent sorrow seems
a modern ecstasy  the dead man knell
is there scarce ask for who  and good men lives
expire before the flowers in their caps 
dying or ere they sicken 


macduff

o  relation
too nice  and yet too true 


malcolm

what the newest grief 


ross

that of an hour age doth hiss the speaker 
each minute teems a new one 


macduff

how does my wife 


ross

why  well 


macduff

         and all my children 


ross

well too 


macduff

the tyrant has not batter at their peace 


ross

no  they were well at peace when i did leave  em 


macduff

but not a niggard of your speech  how goes t 


ross

when i came hither to transport the tidings 
which i have heavily borne  there ran a rumour
of many worthy fellows that were out 
which was to my belief witness the rather 
for that i saw the tyrant power a foot 
now is the time of help  your eye in scotland
would create soldiers  make our women fight 
to doff their dire distresses 


malcolm

be their comfort
we are coming thither  gracious england hath
lent us good siward and ten thousand men 
an older and a better soldier none
that christendom gives out 


ross

would i could answer
this comfort with the like  but i have words
that would be howl out in the desert air 
where hearing should not latch them 


macduff

what concern they 
the general cause  or is it a fee grief
due to some single breast 


ross

no mind that honest
but in it shares some woe  though the main part
pertains to you alone 


macduff

if it be mine 
keep it not from me  quickly let me have it 


ross

let not your ears despise my tongue for ever 
which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
that ever yet they heard 


macduff

hum  i guess at it 


ross

your castle is surprised  your wife and babes
savagely slaughter d  to relate the manner 
were  on the quarry of these murder deer 
to add the death of you 


malcolm

merciful heaven 
what  man  ne pull your hat upon your brows 
give sorrow words  the grief that does not speak
whispers the o er fraught heart and bids it break 


macduff

my children too 


ross

                  wife  children  servants  all
that could be found 


macduff

and i must be from thence 
my wife kill too 


ross

i have said 


malcolm

be comforted 
let make us medicines of our great revenge 
to cure this deadly grief 


macduff

he has no children  all my pretty ones 
did you say all  o hell kite  all 
what  all my pretty chickens and their dam
at one fell swoop 


malcolm

dispute it like a man 


macduff

i shall do so 
but i must also feel it as a man 
i cannot but remember such things were 
that were most precious to me  did heaven look on 
and would not take their part  sinful macduff 
they were all struck for thee  naught that i am 
not for their own demerits  but for mine 
fell slaughter on their souls  heaven rest them now 


malcolm

be this the whetstone of your sword  let grief
convert to anger  blunt not the heart  enrage it 


macduff

o  i could play the woman with mine eyes
and braggart with my tongue  but  gentle heavens 
cut short all intermission  front to front
bring thou this fiend of scotland and myself 
within my sword length set him  if he  scape 
heaven forgive him too 


malcolm

this tune goes manly 
come  go we to the king  our power is ready 
our lack is nothing but our leave  macbeth
is ripe for shaking  and the powers above
put on their instruments  receive what cheer you may 
the night is long that never finds the day 
exeunt
