scene i  dunsinane  ante room in the castle 


enter a doctor of physic and a waiting gentlewoman


doctor

i have two nights watched with you  but can perceive
no truth in your report  when was it she last walked 


gentlewoman

since his majesty went into the field  i have seen
her rise from her bed  throw her night gown upon
her  unlock her closet  take forth paper  fold it 
write upon t  read it  afterwards seal it  and again
return to bed  yet all this while in a most fast sleep 


doctor

a great perturbation in nature  to receive at once
the benefit of sleep  and do the effects of
watching  in this slumbery agitation  besides her
walking and other actual performances  what  at any
time  have you heard her say 


gentlewoman

that  sir  which i will not report after her 


doctor

you may to me  and  most meet you should 


gentlewoman

neither to you nor any one  having no witness to
confirm my speech 
enter lady macbeth  with a taper
lo you  here she comes  this is her very guise 
and  upon my life  fast asleep  observe her  stand close 


doctor

how came she by that light 


gentlewoman

why  it stood by her  she has light by her
continually   her command 


doctor

you see  her eyes are open 


gentlewoman

ay  but their sense is shut 


doctor

what is it she does now  look  how she rubs her hands 


gentlewoman

it is an accustomed action with her  to seem thus
washing her hands  i have known her continue in
this a quarter of an hour 


lady macbeth

yet here a spot 


doctor

hark  she speaks  i will set down what comes from
her  to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly 


lady macbeth

out  damned spot  out  i say one  two  why 
then   time to do t hell is murky fie  my
lord  fie  a soldier  and afeard  what need we
fear who knows it  when none can call our power to
account yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him 


doctor

do you mark that 


lady macbeth

the thane of fife had a wife  where is she now 
what  will these hands ne be clean no more o 
that  my lord  no more o  that  you mar all with
this starting 


doctor

go to  go to  you have known what you should not 


gentlewoman

she has spoke what she should not  i am sure of
that  heaven knows what she has known 


lady macbeth

here the smell of the blood still  all the
perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little
hand  oh  oh  oh 


doctor

what a sigh is there  the heart is sorely charged 


gentlewoman

i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
dignity of the whole body 


doctor

well  well  well 


gentlewoman

pray god it be  sir 


doctor

this disease is beyond my practise  yet i have known
those which have walked in their sleep who have died
holily in their beds 


lady macbeth

wash your hands  put on your nightgown  look not so
pale i tell you yet again  banquo buried  he
cannot come out on grave 


doctor

even so 


lady macbeth

to bed  to bed  there knocking at the gate 
come  come  come  come  give me your hand  what 
done cannot be undone to bed  to bed  to bed 
exit


doctor

will she go now to bed 


gentlewoman

directly 


doctor

foul whisperings are abroad  unnatural deeds
do breed unnatural troubles  infected minds
to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets 
more needs she the divine than the physician 
god  god forgive us all  look after her 
remove from her the means of all annoyance 
and still keep eyes upon her  so  good night 
my mind she has mated  and amazed my sight 
i think  but dare not speak 


gentlewoman

good night  good doctor
