scene ii  the country near dunsinane 


drum and colours  enter menteith  caithness  angus  lennox  and soldiers


menteith

the english power is near  led on by malcolm 
his uncle siward and the good macduff 
revenges burn in them  for their dear causes
would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
excite the mortified man 


angus

near birnam wood
shall we well meet them  that way are they coming 


caithness

who knows if donalbain be with his brother 


lennox

for certain  sir  he is not  i have a file
of all the gentry  there is siward son 
and many unrough youths that even now
protest their first of manhood 


menteith

what does the tyrant 


caithness

great dunsinane he strongly fortifies 
some say he mad  others that lesser hate him
do call it valiant fury  but  for certain 
he cannot buckle his distemper cause
within the belt of rule 


angus

now does he feel
his secret murders sticking on his hands 
now minutely revolts upbraid his faith breach 
those he commands move only in command 
nothing in love  now does he feel his title
hang loose about him  like a giant robe
upon a dwarfish thief 


menteith

who then shall blame
his pester senses to recoil and start 
when all that is within him does condemn
itself for being there 


caithness

well  march we on 
to give obedience where  truly owed 
meet we the medicine of the sickly weal 
and with him pour we in our country purge
each drop of us 


lennox

                  or so much as it needs 
to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds 
make we our march towards birnam 
exeunt  marching
