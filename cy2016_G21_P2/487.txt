was he not born of woman  the spirits that know
all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus 
 not  macbeth  no man that born of woman
shall e have power upon thee  then fly 
false thanes 
and mingle with the english epicures 
the mind i sway by and the heart i bear
shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear

exit servant
seyton i am sick at heart 
when i behold seyton  i say this push
will cheer me ever  or disseat me now 
i have lived long enough  my way of life
is fall into the sear  the yellow leaf 
and that which should accompany old age 
as honour  love  obedience  troops of friends 
i must not look to have  but  in their stead 
curses  not loud but deep  mouth honour  breath 
which the poor heart would fain deny  and dare not  seyton 
enter seyton


seyton

what is your gracious pleasure 


macbeth

what news more 


seyton

all is confirm d  my lord  which was reported 


macbeth

i fight till from my bones my flesh be hack d 
give me my armour 


seyton

 not needed yet 


macbeth

i put it on 
send out more horses  skirr the country round 
hang those that talk of fear  give me mine armour 
how does your patient  doctor 


doctor

not so sick  my lord 
as she is troubled with thick coming fancies 
that keep her from her rest 


macbeth

cure her of that 
canst thou not minister to a mind diseased 
pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow 
raze out the written troubles of the brain
and with some sweet oblivious antidote
cleanse the stuff bosom of that perilous stuff
which weighs upon the heart 


doctor

therein the patient
must minister to himself 


macbeth

throw physic to the dogs  i none of it 
come  put mine armour on  give me my staff 
seyton  send out  doctor  the thanes fly from me 
come  sir  dispatch  if thou couldst  doctor  cast
the water of my land  find her disease 
and purge it to a sound and pristine health 
i would applaud thee to the very echo 
that should applaud again pull off  i say 
what rhubarb  cyme  or what purgative drug 
would scour these english hence  hear thou of them 


doctor

ay  my good lord  your royal preparation
makes us hear something 


macbeth

bring it after me 
i will not be afraid of death and bane 
till birnam forest come to dunsinane 


doctor

 aside   were i from dunsinane away and clear 
profit again should hardly draw me here
