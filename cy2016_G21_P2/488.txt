scene iv  country near birnam wood 


drum and colours  enter malcolm  siward and young  siward  macduff  menteith  caithness  angus  lennox  ross  and soldiers  marching


malcolm

cousins  i hope the days are near at hand
that chambers will be safe 


menteith

we doubt it nothing 


siward

what wood is this before us 


menteith

the wood of birnam 


malcolm

let every soldier hew him down a bough
and bear before him  thereby shall we shadow
the numbers of our host and make discovery
err in report of us 


soldiers

it shall be done 


siward

we learn no other but the confident tyrant
keeps still in dunsinane  and will endure
our setting down before  t 


malcolm

 his main hope 
for where there is advantage to be given 
both more and less have given him the revolt 
and none serve with him but constrained things
whose hearts are absent too 


macduff

let our just censures
attend the true event  and put we on
industrious soldiership 


siward

the time approaches
that will with due decision make us know
what we shall say we have and what we owe 
thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate 
but certain issue strokes must arbitrate 
towards which advance the war 
exeunt  marching
