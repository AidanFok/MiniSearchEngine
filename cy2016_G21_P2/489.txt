scene v  dunsinane  within the castle 


enter macbeth  seyton  and soldiers  with drum and colours


macbeth

hang out our banners on the outward walls 
the cry is still  come  our castle strength
will laugh a siege to scorn  here let them lie
till famine and the ague eat them up 
were they not forced with those that should be ours 
we might have met them dareful  beard to beard 
and beat them backward home 
a cry of women within
what is that noise 


seyton

it is the cry of women  my good lord 
exit


macbeth

i have almost forgot the taste of fears 
the time has been  my senses would have cool 
to hear a night shriek  and my fell of hair
would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
as life were in t  i have supp full with horrors 
direness  familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
cannot once start me 
re enter seyton
wherefore was that cry 


seyton

the queen  my lord  is dead 


macbeth

she should have died hereafter 
there would have been a time for such a word 
to morrow  and to morrow  and to morrow 
creeps in this petty pace from day to day
to the last syllable of recorded time 
and all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dusty death  out  out  brief candle 
life but a walking shadow  a poor player
that struts and frets his hour upon the stage
and then is heard no more  it is a tale
told by an idiot  full of sound and fury 
signifying nothing 
enter a messenger
thou comest to use thy tongue  thy story quickly 


messenger

gracious my lord 
i should report that which i say i saw 
but know not how to do it 


macbeth

well  say  sir 


messenger

as i did stand my watch upon the hill 
i look toward birnam  and anon  methought 
the wood began to move 


macbeth

liar and slave 


messenger

let me endure your wrath  if be not so 
within this three mile may you see it coming 
i say  a moving grove 


macbeth

if thou speak false 
upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive 
till famine cling thee  if thy speech be sooth 
i care not if thou dost for me as much 
i pull in resolution  and begin
to doubt the equivocation of the fiend
that lies like truth   not  till birnam wood
do come to dunsinane   and now a wood
comes toward dunsinane  arm  arm  and out 
if this which he avouches does appear 
there is nor flying hence nor tarrying here 
i gin to be aweary of the sun 
and wish the estate o  the world were now undone 
ring the alarum bell  blow  wind  come  wrack 
at least we die with harness on our back 
exeunt
