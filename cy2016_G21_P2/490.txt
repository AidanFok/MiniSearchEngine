malcolm

now near enough  your leafy screens throw down 
and show like those you are  you  worthy uncle 
shall  with my cousin  your right noble son 
lead our first battle  worthy macduff and we
shall take upon  what else remains to do 
according to our order

fare you well 
do we but find the tyrant power to night 
let us be beaten  if we cannot fight 


macduff

make all our trumpets speak  give them all breath 
those clamorous harbingers of blood and death 
exeunt
