scene viii  another part of the field 


enter macbeth


macbeth

why should i play the roman fool  and die
on mine own sword  whiles i see lives  the gashes
do better upon them 
enter macduff


macduff

turn  hell hound  turn 


macbeth

of all men else i have avoided thee 
but get thee back  my soul is too much charged
with blood of thine already 


macduff

i have no words 
my voice is in my sword  thou bloodier villain
than terms can give thee out 
they fight


macbeth

thou losest labour 
as easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed 
let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests 
i bear a charmed life  which must not yield 
to one of woman born 


macduff

despair thy charm 
and let the angel whom thou still hast served
tell thee  macduff was from his mother womb
untimely ripp d 


macbeth

accursed be that tongue that tells me so 
for it hath cow my better part of man 
and be these juggling fiends no more believed 
that palter with us in a double sense 
that keep the word of promise to our ear 
and break it to our hope  i not fight with thee 


macduff

then yield thee  coward 
and live to be the show and gaze o  the time 
we have thee  as our rarer monsters are 
painted on a pole  and underwrit 
 may you see the tyrant 


macbeth

i will not yield 
to kiss the ground before young malcolm feet 
and to be baited with the rabble curse 
though birnam wood be come to dunsinane 
and thou opposed  being of no woman born 
yet i will try the last  before my body
i throw my warlike shield  lay on  macduff 
and damn be him that first cries   hold  enough 
exeunt  fighting  alarums
retreat  flourish  enter  with drum and colours  malcolm  siward  ross  the other thanes  and soldiers


malcolm

i would the friends we miss were safe arrived 


siward

some must go off  and yet  by these i see 
so great a day as this is cheaply bought 


malcolm

macduff is missing  and your noble son 


ross

your son  my lord  has paid a soldier debt 
he only lived but till he was a man 
the which no sooner had his prowess confirm 
in the unshrinking station where he fought 
but like a man he died 


siward

then he is dead 


ross

ay  and brought off the field  your cause of sorrow
must not be measured by his worth  for then
it hath no end 


siward

                  had he his hurts before 


ross

ay  on the front 


siward

                  why then  god soldier be he 
had i as many sons as i have hairs 
i would not wish them to a fairer death 
and so  his knell is knoll d 


malcolm

he worth more sorrow 
and that i spend for him 


siward

he worth no more
they say he parted well  and paid his score 
and so  god be with him  here comes newer comfort 
re enter macduff  with macbeth head


macduff

hail  king  for so thou art  behold  where stands
the usurper cursed head  the time is free 
i see thee compass with thy kingdom pearl 
that speak my salutation in their minds 
whose voices i desire aloud with mine 
hail  king of scotland 


all

hail  king of scotland 
flourish


malcolm

we shall not spend a large expense of time
before we reckon with your several loves 
and make us even with you  my thanes and kinsmen 
henceforth be earls  the first that ever scotland
in such an honour named  what more to do 
which would be planted newly with the time 
as calling home our exiled friends abroad
that fled the snares of watchful tyranny 
producing forth the cruel ministers
of this dead butcher and his fiend like queen 
who  as  thought  by self and violent hands
took off her life  this  and what needful else
that calls upon us  by the grace of grace 
we will perform in measure  time and place 
so  thanks to all at once and to each one 
whom we invite to see us crown at scone 
flourish  exeunt
