francisca

isabella

yes  truly  i speak not as desiring more 
but rather wishing a more strict restraint
upon the sisterhood  the votarists of saint clare 


lucio

 within   ho  peace be in this place 


isabella

when you have vow d  you must not speak with men
but in the presence of the prioress 
then  if you speak  you must not show your face 
or  if you show your face  you must not speak 
he calls again  i pray you  answer him

lucio

hail  virgin  if you be  as those cheek roses
proclaim you are no less  can you so stead me
as bring me to the sight of isabella 
a novice of this place and the fair sister
to her unhappy brother claudio 


isabella

why  unhappy brother  let me ask 
the rather for i now must make you know
i am that isabella and his sister 


lucio

gentle and fair  your brother kindly greets you 
not to be weary with you  he in prison 


isabella

woe me  for what 


lucio

for that which  if myself might be his judge 
he should receive his punishment in thanks 
he hath got his friend with child 


isabella

sir  make me not your story 


lucio

it is true 
i would not though  my familiar sin
with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest 
tongue far from heart play with all virgins so 
i hold you as a thing ensky and sainted 
by your renouncement an immortal spirit 
and to be talk with in sincerity 
as with a saint 


isabella

you do blaspheme the good in mocking me 


lucio

do not believe it  fewness and truth   thus 
your brother and his lover have embraced 
as those that feed grow full  as blossoming time
that from the seedness the bare fallow brings
to teeming foison  even so her plenteous womb
expresseth his full tilth and husbandry 


isabella

some one with child by him  my cousin juliet 


lucio

is she your cousin 


isabella

adoptedly  as school maids change their names
by vain though apt affection 


lucio

she it is 


isabella

o  let him marry her 


lucio

this is the point 
the duke is very strangely gone from hence 
bore many gentlemen  myself being one 
in hand and hope of action  but we do learn
by those that know the very nerves of state 
his givings out were of an infinite distance
from his true meant design  upon his place 
and with full line of his authority 
governs lord angelo  a man whose blood
is very snow broth  one who never feels
the wanton stings and motions of the sense 
but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
with profits of the mind  study and fast 
he to give fear to use and liberty 
which have for long run by the hideous law 
as mice by lions hath pick out an act 
under whose heavy sense your brother life
falls into forfeit  he arrests him on it 
and follows close the rigour of the statute 
to make him an example  all hope is gone 
unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
to soften angelo  and that my pith of business
 you and your poor brother 


isabella

doth he so seek his life 


lucio

has censured him
already  and  as i hear  the provost hath
a warrant for his execution 


isabella

alas  what poor ability in me
to do him good 


lucio

                  assay the power you have 


isabella

my power  alas  i doubt 


lucio

our doubts are traitors
and make us lose the good we oft might win
by fearing to attempt  go to lord angelo 
and let him learn to know  when maidens sue 
men give like gods  but when they weep and kneel 
all their petitions are as freely theirs
as they themselves would owe them 


isabella

i see what i can do 


lucio

but speedily 


isabella

i will about it straight 
no longer staying but to give the mother
notice of my affair  i humbly thank you 
commend me to my brother  soon at night
i send him certain word of my success 


lucio

i take my leave of you 


isabella

good sir  adieu 
exeunt
