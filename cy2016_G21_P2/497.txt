scene i  a hall in angelo house 


enter angelo  escalus  and a justice  provost  officers  and other attendants  behind


angelo

we must not make a scarecrow of the law 
setting it up to fear the birds of prey 
and let it keep one shape  till custom make it
their perch and not their terror 


escalus

ay  but yet
let us be keen  and rather cut a little 
than fall  and bruise to death  alas  this gentleman
whom i would save  had a most noble father 
let but your honour know 
whom i believe to be most strait in virtue 
that  in the working of your own affections 
had time cohered with place or place with wishing 
or that the resolute acting of your blood
could have attain the effect of your own purpose 
whether you had not sometime in your life
err in this point which now you censure him 
and pull the law upon you 


angelo

 one thing to be tempted  escalus 
another thing to fall  i not deny 
the jury  passing on the prisoner life 
may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
guiltier than him they try  what open made to justice 
that justice seizes  what know the laws
that thieves do pass on thieves   very pregnant 
the jewel that we find  we stoop and take 
because we see it  but what we do not see
we tread upon  and never think of it 
you may not so extenuate his offence
for i have had such faults  but rather tell me 
when i  that censure him  do so offend 
let mine own judgment pattern out my death 
and nothing come in partial  sir  he must die 


escalus

be it as your wisdom will 


angelo

where is the provost 


provost

here  if it like your honour 


angelo

see that claudio
be executed by nine to morrow morning 
bring him his confessor  let him be prepared 
for that the utmost of his pilgrimage 
exit provost


escalus

 aside   well  heaven forgive him  and forgive us all 
some rise by sin  and some by virtue fall 
some run from brakes of ice  and answer none 
and some condemned for a fault alone 
enter elbow  and officers with froth and pompey


elbow

come  bring them away  if these be good people in
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
common houses  i know no law  bring them away 


angelo

constable  and my name is elbow  i do lean upon
justice  sir  and do bring in here before your good
honour two notorious benefactors 


angelo

benefactors  well  what benefactors are they  are
they not malefactors 


elbow

are  but precise villains they are  that i am sure
