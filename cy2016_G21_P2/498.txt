to isabella

isabella

i am a woeful suitor to your honour 
please but your honour hear me 


angelo

well  what your suit 


isabella

there is a vice that most i do abhor 
and most desire should meet the blow of justice 
for which i would not plead  but that i must 
for which i must not plead  but that i am
at war  will and will not 


angelo

well  the matter 


isabella

i have a brother is condemn to die 
i do beseech you  let it be his fault 
and not my brother 


provost

 aside   heaven give thee moving graces 


angelo

condemn the fault and not the actor of it 
why  every fault condemn ere it be done 
mine were the very cipher of a function 
to fine the faults whose fine stands in record 
and let go by the actor 


isabella

o just but severe law 
i had a brother  then  heaven keep your honour 


lucio

 aside to isabella   give not o so  to him
again  entreat him 
kneel down before him  hang upon his gown 
you are too cold  if you should need a pin 
you could not with more tame a tongue desire it 
to him  i say 


isabella

must he needs die 


angelo

                  maiden  no remedy 


isabella

yes  i do think that you might pardon him 
and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy 


angelo

i will not do t 


isabella

                  but can you  if you would 


angelo

look  what i will not  that i cannot do 


isabella

but might you do t  and do the world no wrong 
if so your heart were touch with that remorse
a s mine is to him 


angelo

                  he sentenced   too late 


lucio

 aside to isabella   you are too cold 


isabella

too late  why  no  i  that do speak a word 
may call it back again  well  believe this 
no ceremony that to great ones  longs 
not the king crown  nor the deputed sword 
the marshal truncheon  nor the judge robe 
become them with one half so good a grace
as mercy does 
if he had been as you and you as he 
you would have slipt like him  but he  like you 
would not have been so stern 


angelo

pray you  be gone 


isabella

i would to heaven i had your potency 
and you were isabel  should it then be thus 
no  i would tell what  to be a judge 
and what a prisoner 


lucio

 aside to isabella 
ay  touch him  there the vein 


angelo

your brother is a forfeit of the law 
and you but waste your words 


isabella

alas  alas 
why  all the souls that were were forfeit once 
and he that might the vantage best have took
found out the remedy  how would you be 
if he  which is the top of judgment  should
but judge you as you are  o  think on that 
and mercy then will breathe within your lips 
like man new made 


angelo

                  be you content  fair maid 
it is the law  not i condemn your brother 
were he my kinsman  brother  or my son 
it should be thus with him  he must die tomorrow 


isabella

to morrow  o  that sudden  spare him  spare him 
he not prepared for death  even for our kitchens
we kill the fowl of season  shall we serve heaven
with less respect than we do minister
to our gross selves  good  good my lord  bethink you 
who is it that hath died for this offence 
there many have committed it 


lucio

 aside to isabella            ay  well said 


angelo

the law hath not been dead  though it hath slept 
those many had not dared to do that evil 
if the first that did the edict infringe
had answer for his deed  now  awake
takes note of what is done  and  like a prophet 
looks in a glass  that shows what future evils 
either new  or by remissness new conceived 
and so in progress to be hatch and born 
are now to have no successive degrees 
but  ere they live  to end 


isabella

yet show some pity 


angelo

i show it most of all when i show justice 
for then i pity those i do not know 
which a dismiss offence would after gall 
and do him right that  answering one foul wrong 
lives not to act another  be satisfied 
your brother dies to morrow  be content 


isabella

so you must be the first that gives this sentence 
and he  that suffer s  o  it is excellent
to have a giant strength  but it is tyrannous
to use it like a giant 


lucio

 aside to isabella    that well said 


isabella

could great men thunder
as jove himself does  jove would ne be quiet 
for every pelting  petty officer
would use his heaven for thunder 
nothing but thunder  merciful heaven 
thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
split the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
than the soft myrtle  but man  proud man 
drest in a little brief authority 
most ignorant of what he most assured 
his glassy essence  like an angry ape 
plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
as make the angels weep  who  with our spleens 
would all themselves laugh mortal 


lucio

 aside to isabella   o  to him  to him  wench  he
will relent 
he coming  i perceive  t 


provost

 aside   pray heaven she win him 


isabella

we cannot weigh our brother with ourself 
great men may jest with saints   wit in them 
but in the less foul profanation 


lucio

thou i  the right  girl  more o  that 


isabella

that in the captain but a choleric word 
which in the soldier is flat blasphemy 


lucio

 aside to isabella   art avised o  that  more on  t 


angelo

why do you put these sayings upon me 


isabella

because authority  though it err like others 
hath yet a kind of medicine in itself 
that skins the vice o  the top  go to your bosom 
knock there  and ask your heart what it doth know
that like my brother fault  if it confess
a natural guiltiness such as is his 
let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
against my brother life 


angelo

 aside                   she speaks  and  
such sense  that my sense breeds with it  fare you well 


isabella

gentle my lord  turn back 


angelo

i will bethink me  come again tomorrow 


isabella

hark how i bribe you  good my lord  turn back 


angelo

how  bribe me 


isabella

ay  with such gifts that heaven shall share with you 


lucio

 aside to isabella   you had marr all else 


isabella

not with fond shekels of the tested gold 
or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
as fancy values them  but with true prayers
that shall be up at heaven and enter there
ere sun rise  prayers from preserved souls 
from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
to nothing temporal 


angelo

well  come to me to morrow 


lucio

 aside to isabella   go to   well  away 


isabella

heaven keep your honour safe 


angelo

 aside 	amen 
for i am that way going to temptation 
where prayers cross 


isabella

at what hour to morrow
shall i attend your lordship 


angelo

at any time  noon 


isabella

 your honour 
exeunt isabella  lucio  and provost


angelo

                  from thee  even from thy virtue 
what this  what this  is this her fault or mine 
the tempter or the tempted  who sins most 
ha 
not she  nor doth she tempt  but it is i
that  lying by the violet in the sun 
do as the carrion does  not as the flower 
corrupt with virtuous season  can it be
that modesty may more betray our sense
than woman lightness  having waste ground enough 
shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
and pitch our evils there  o  fie  fie  fie 
what dost thou  or what art thou  angelo 
dost thou desire her foully for those things
that make her good  o  let her brother live 
thieves for their robbery have authority
when judges steal themselves  what  do i love her 
that i desire to hear her speak again 
and feast upon her eyes  what is i dream on 
o cunning enemy  that  to catch a saint 
with saints dost bait thy hook  most dangerous
is that temptation that doth goad us on
to sin in loving virtue  never could the strumpet 
with all her double vigour  art and nature 
once stir my temper  but this virtuous maid
subdues me quite  even till now 
when men were fond  i smiled and wonder how 
exit
