scene iii  a room in a prison 


enter  severally  duke vincentio disguised as a friar  and provost


duke vincentio

hail to you  provost  so i think you are 


provost

i am the provost  what your will  good friar 


duke vincentio

bound by my charity and my blest order 
i come to visit the afflicted spirits
here in the prison  do me the common right
to let me see them and to make me know
the nature of their crimes  that i may minister
to them accordingly 


provost

i would do more than that  if more were needful 
enter juliet
look  here comes one  a gentlewoman of mine 
who  falling in the flaws of her own youth 
hath blister her report  she is with child 
and he that got it  sentenced  a young man
more fit to do another such offence
than die for this 


duke vincentio

when must he die 


provost

                  as i do think  to morrow 
i have provided for you  stay awhile 
to juliet
and you shall be conducted 


duke vincentio

repent you  fair one  of the sin you carry 


juliet

i do  and bear the shame most patiently 


duke vincentio

i teach you how you shall arraign your conscience 
and try your penitence  if it be sound 
or hollowly put on 


juliet

i gladly learn 


duke vincentio

love you the man that wrong you 


juliet

yes  as i love the woman that wrong him 


duke vincentio

so then it seems your most offenceful act
was mutually committed 


juliet

mutually 


duke vincentio

then was your sin of heavier kind than his 


juliet

i do confess it  and repent it  father 


duke vincentio

 meet so  daughter  but lest you do repent 
as that the sin hath brought you to this shame 
which sorrow is always towards ourselves  not heaven 
showing we would not spare heaven as we love it 
but as we stand in fear 


juliet

i do repent me  as it is an evil 
and take the shame with joy 


duke vincentio

there rest 
your partner  as i hear  must die to morrow 
and i am going with instruction to him 
grace go with you  benedicite 
exit


juliet

must die to morrow  o injurious love 
that respites me a life  whose very comfort
is still a dying horror 


provost

 pity of him 
exeunt
