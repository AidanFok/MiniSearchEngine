your house  he could be contented  why is he not 
then  in respect of the love he bears our house 
he shows in this  he loves his own barn better than
he loves our house  let me see some more   
purpose you undertake is dangerous why  that 
certain   dangerous to take a cold  to sleep  to
drink  but i tell you  my lord fool  out of this
nettle  danger  we pluck this flower  safety   
purpose you undertake is dangerous  the friends you
have named uncertain  the time itself unsorted  and
your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so
great an opposition  say you so  say you so  i say
unto you again  you are a shallow cowardly hind  and
you lie   what a lack brain is this  by the lord 
our plot is a good plot as ever was laid  our
friends true and constant  a good plot  good
friends  and full of expectation  an excellent plot 
very good friends  what a frosty spirited rogue is

general course of action   zounds  an i were now by
this rascal  i could brain him with his lady fan

forward already  what a pagan rascal is this  an
infidel  ha  you shall see now in very sincerity
of fear and cold heart  will he to the king and lay
open all our proceedings  o  i could divide myself
and go to buffets  for moving such a dish of
skim milk with so honourable an action  hang him 
let him tell the king  we are prepared  i will set
forward to night

o  my good lord  why are you thus alone 
for what offence have i this fortnight been
a banish woman from my harry bed 
tell me  sweet lord  what is that takes from thee
thy stomach  pleasure and thy golden sleep 
why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth 
and start so often when thou sit alone 
why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks 
and given my treasures and my rights of thee
to thick eyed musing and cursed melancholy 
in thy faint slumbers i by thee have watch d 
and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars 
speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed 
cry  courage  to the field  and thou hast talk 
of sallies and retires  of trenches  tents 
of palisadoes  frontiers  parapets 
of basilisks  of cannon  culverin 
of prisoners  ransom and of soldiers slain 
and all the currents of a heady fight 
thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
and thus hath so bestirr thee in thy sleep 
that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
like bubbles in a late disturbed stream 
and in thy face strange motions have appear d 
such as we see when men restrain their breath
on some great sudden hest  o  what portents are these 
some heavy business hath my lord in hand 
and i must know it  else he loves me not
