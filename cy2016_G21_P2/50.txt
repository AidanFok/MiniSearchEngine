enter prince henry and poins


prince henry

before god  i am exceeding weary 


poins

is come to that  i had thought weariness durst not
have attached one of so high blood 


prince henry

faith  it does me  though it discolours the
complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it  doth
it not show vilely in me to desire small beer 


poins

why  a prince should not be so loosely studied as
to remember so weak a composition 


prince henry

belike then my appetite was not princely got  for 
by my troth  i do now remember the poor creature 
small beer  but  indeed  these humble
considerations make me out of love with my
greatness  what a disgrace is it to me to remember
thy name  or to know thy face to morrow  or to
take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
hast  viz  these  and those that were thy
peach coloured ones  or to bear the inventory of thy
shirts  as  one for superfluity  and another for
use  but that the tennis court keeper knows better
than i  for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
thou keepest not racket there  as thou hast not done
a great while  because the rest of thy low
countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland 
and god knows  whether those that bawl out the ruins
of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom  but the
midwives say the children are not in the fault 
whereupon the world increases  and kindreds are
mightily strengthened 


poins

how ill it follows  after you have laboured so hard 
you should talk so idly  tell me  how many good
young princes would do so  their fathers being so
sick as yours at this time is 


prince henry

shall i tell thee one thing  poins 


poins

yes  faith  and let it be an excellent good thing 


prince henry

it shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine 


poins

go to  i stand the push of your one thing that you
will tell 


prince henry

marry  i tell thee  it is not meet that i should be
sad  now my father is sick  albeit i could tell
thee  as to one it pleases me  for fault of a
better  to call my friend  i could be sad  and sad
indeed too 


poins

very hardly upon such a subject 


prince henry

by this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil 
book as thou and falstaff for obduracy and
persistency  let the end try the man  but i tell
thee  my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
sick  and keeping such vile company as thou art
hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow 


poins

the reason 


prince henry

what wouldst thou think of me  if i should weep 


poins

i would think thee a most princely hypocrite 


prince henry

it would be every man thought  and thou art a
blessed fellow to think as every man thinks  never
a man thought in the world keeps the road way
better than thine  every man would think me an
hypocrite indeed  and what accites your most
worshipful thought to think so 


poins

why  because you have been so lewd and so much
engraffed to falstaff 


prince henry

and to thee 


poins

by this light  i am well spoke on  i can hear it
with my own ears  the worst that they can say of
me is that i am a second brother and that i am a
proper fellow of my hands  and those two things  i
confess  i cannot help  by the mass  here comes bardolph 
enter bardolph and page


prince henry

and the boy that i gave falstaff  a  had him from
me christian  and look  if the fat villain have not
transformed him ape 


bardolph

god save your grace 


prince henry

and yours  most noble bardolph 


bardolph

come  you virtuous ass  you bashful fool  must you
be blushing  wherefore blush you now  what a
maidenly man at arms are you become  is such a
matter to get a pottle pot maidenhead 


page

a  calls me e now  my lord  through a red
lattice  and i could discern no part of his face
from the window  at last i spied his eyes  and
methought he had made two holes in the ale wife 
new petticoat and so peeped through 


prince henry

has not the boy profited 


bardolph

of a fire brand  and therefore i call him her dream 


prince henry

cankers  well  there is sixpence to preserve thee 


bardolph

an you do not make him hanged among you  the
gallows shall have wrong 


prince henry

and how doth thy master  bardolph 


bardolph

town  there a letter for you 


poins

martlemas  your master 


bardolph

in bodily health  sir 


poins

marry  the immortal part needs a physician  but
that moves not him  though that be sick  it dies
not 


prince henry

i do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my
dog  and he holds his place  for look you how be writes 


poins

 reads    falstaff  knight every man must
know that  as oft as he has occasion to name
himself  even like those that are kin to the king 
for they never prick their finger but they say 
 there some of the king blood spilt   
comes that  says he  that takes upon him not to
conceive  the answer is as ready as a borrower 
cap   am the king poor cousin  sir 


prince henry

nay  they will be kin to us  or they will fetch it
from japhet  but to the letter 


poins

 reads    john falstaff  knight  to the son of
the king  nearest his father  harry prince of
wales  greeting  why  this is a certificate 


prince henry

peace 


poins

 reads    will imitate the honourable romans in
brevity  he sure means brevity in breath 
short winded   commend me to thee  i commend
thee  and i leave thee  be not too familiar with
poins  for he misuses thy favours so much  that he
swears thou art to marry his sister nell  repent
at idle times as thou mayest  and so  farewell 
thine  by yea and no  which is as much as to
say  as thou usest him  jack falstaff with my
familiars  john with my brothers and sisters 
and sir john with all europe 
my lord  i steep this letter in sack and make him eat it 


prince henry

that to make him eat twenty of his words  but do
you use me thus  ned  must i marry your sister 


poins

god send the wench no worse fortune  but i never said so 


prince henry

well  thus we play the fools with the time  and the
spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us 
is your master here in london

alban and london

in his true colours  and not ourselves be seen

upon him at his table as drawers
