scene iv  a room in angelo house 


enter angelo


angelo

when i would pray and think  i think and pray
to several subjects  heaven hath my empty words 
whilst my invention  hearing not my tongue 
anchors on isabel  heaven in my mouth 
as if i did but only chew his name 
and in my heart the strong and swelling evil
of my conception  the state  whereon i studied
is like a good thing  being often read 
grown fear and tedious  yea  my gravity 
wherein let no man hear me i take pride 
could i with boot change for an idle plume 
which the air beats for vain  o place  o form 
how often dost thou with thy case  thy habit 
wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
to thy false seeming  blood  thou art blood 
let write good angel on the devil horn 
 not the devil crest 
enter a servant
how now  who there 


servant

one isabel  a sister  desires access to you 


angelo

teach her the way 
exit servant
o heavens 
why does my blood thus muster to my heart 
making both it unable for itself 
and dispossessing all my other parts
of necessary fitness 
so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons 
come all to help him  and so stop the air
by which he should revive  and even so
the general  subject to a well wish king 
quit their own part  and in obsequious fondness
crowd to his presence  where their untaught love
must needs appear offence 
enter isabella
how now  fair maid 


isabella

i am come to know your pleasure 


angelo

that you might know it  would much better please me
than to demand what  tis  your brother cannot live 


isabella

even so  heaven keep your honour 


angelo

yet may he live awhile  and  it may be 


as long as you or i

yet he must die 


isabella

under your sentence 


angelo

yea 


isabella

when  i beseech you  that in his reprieve 
longer or shorter  he may be so fitted
that his soul sicken not 


angelo

ha  fie  these filthy vices  it were as good
to pardon him that hath from nature stolen
a man already made  as to remit
their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven image
in stamps that are forbid   all as easy
falsely to take away a life true made
as to put metal in restrained means
to make a false one 


isabella

 set down so in heaven  but not in earth 


angelo

say you so  then i shall pose you quickly 
which had you rather  that the most just law
now took your brother life  or  to redeem him 
give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
as she that he hath stain d 


isabella

sir  believe this 
i had rather give my body than my soul 


angelo

i talk not of your soul  our compell sins
stand more for number than for accompt 


isabella

how say you 


angelo

nay  i not warrant that  for i can speak
against the thing i say  answer to this 
i  now the voice of the recorded law 
pronounce a sentence on your brother life 
might there not be a charity in sin
to save this brother life 


isabella

please you to do t 
i take it as a peril to my soul 
it is no sin at all  but charity 


angelo

pleased you to do at peril of your soul 
were equal poise of sin and charity 


isabella

that i do beg his life  if it be sin 
heaven let me bear it  you granting of my suit 
if that be sin  i make it my morn prayer
to have it added to the faults of mine 
and nothing of your answer 


angelo

nay  but hear me 
your sense pursues not mine  either you are ignorant 
or seem so craftily  and that not good 


isabella

let me be ignorant  and in nothing good 
but graciously to know i am no better 


angelo

thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
when it doth tax itself  as these black masks
proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
than beauty could  display d  but mark me 
to be received plain  i speak more gross 
your brother is to die 


isabella

so 


angelo

and his offence is so  as it appears 
accountant to the law upon that pain 


isabella

true 


angelo

admit no other way to save his life 
as i subscribe not that  nor any other 
but in the loss of question that you  his sister 
finding yourself desired of such a person 
whose credit with the judge  or own great place 
could fetch your brother from the manacles
of the all building law  and that there were
no earthly mean to save him  but that either
you must lay down the treasures of your body
to this supposed  or else to let him suffer 
what would you do 


isabella

as much for my poor brother as myself 
that is  were i under the terms of death 
the impression of keen whips i wear as rubies 
and strip myself to death  as to a bed
that longing have been sick for  ere i yield
my body up to shame 


angelo

then must your brother die 


isabella

and  the cheaper way 
better it were a brother died at once 
than that a sister  by redeeming him 
should die for ever 


angelo

were not you then as cruel as the sentence
that you have slander so 


isabella

ignomy in ransom and free pardon
are of two houses  lawful mercy
is nothing kin to foul redemption 


angelo

you seem of late to make the law a tyrant 
and rather proved the sliding of your brother
a merriment than a vice 


isabella

o  pardon me  my lord  it oft falls out 
to have what we would have  we speak not what we mean 
i something do excuse the thing i hate 
for his advantage that i dearly love 


angelo

we are all frail 


isabella

                  else let my brother die 
if not a feodary  but only he
owe and succeed thy weakness 


angelo

nay  women are frail too 


isabella

ay  as the glasses where they view themselves 
which are as easy broke as they make forms 
women  help heaven  men their creation mar
in profiting by them  nay  call us ten times frail 
for we are soft as our complexions are 
and credulous to false prints 


angelo

i think it well 
and from this testimony of your own sex 
since i suppose we are made to be no stronger
than faults may shake our frames let me be bold 
i do arrest your words  be that you are 
that is  a woman  if you be more  you none 
if you be one  as you are well express 
by all external warrants  show it now 
by putting on the destined livery 


isabella

i have no tongue but one  gentle my lord 
let me entreat you speak the former language 


angelo

plainly conceive  i love you 


isabella

my brother did love juliet 
and you tell me that he shall die for it 


angelo

he shall not  isabel  if you give me love 


isabella

i know your virtue hath a licence in t 
which seems a little fouler than it is 
to pluck on others 


angelo

believe me  on mine honour 
my words express my purpose 


isabella

ha  little honour to be much believed 
and most pernicious purpose  seeming  seeming 
i will proclaim thee  angelo  look for t 
sign me a present pardon for my brother 
or with an outstretch throat i tell the world aloud
what man thou art 


angelo

                  who will believe thee  isabel 
my unsoil name  the austereness of my life 
my vouch against you  and my place i  the state 
will so your accusation overweigh 
that you shall stifle in your own report
and smell of calumny  i have begun 
and now i give my sensual race the rein 
fit thy consent to my sharp appetite 
lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes 
that banish what they sue for  redeem thy brother
by yielding up thy body to my will 
or else he must not only die the death 
but thy unkindness shall his death draw out
to lingering sufferance  answer me to morrow 
or  by the affection that now guides me most 
i prove a tyrant to him  as for you 
say what you can  my false o your true 
exit


isabella

to whom should i complain  did i tell this 
who would believe me  o perilous mouths 
that bear in them one and the self same tongue 
either of condemnation or approof 
bidding the law make court to their will 
hooking both right and wrong to the appetite 
to follow as it draws  i to my brother 
though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood 
yet hath he in him such a mind of honour 
that  had he twenty heads to tender down
on twenty bloody blocks  he yield them up 
before his sister should her body stoop
to such abhorr pollution 
then  isabel  live chaste  and  brother  die 
more than our brother is our chastity 
i tell him yet of angelo request 
and fit his mind to death  for his soul rest 
exit
