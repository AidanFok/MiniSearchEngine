duke vincentio

so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo 


claudio

the miserable have no other medicine
but only hope 
i hope to live  and am prepared to die 


duke vincentio

be absolute for death  either death or life
shall thereby be the sweeter  reason thus with life 
if i do lose thee  i do lose a thing
that none but fools would keep  a breath thou art 
servile to all the skyey influences 
that dost this habitation  where thou keep st 
hourly afflict  merely  thou art death fool 
for him thou labour by thy flight to shun
and yet runn toward him still  thou art not noble 
for all the accommodations that thou bear 
are nursed by baseness  thou by no means valiant 
for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
of a poor worm  thy best of rest is sleep 
and that thou oft provokest  yet grossly fear 
thy death  which is no more  thou art not thyself 
for thou exist on many a thousand grains
that issue out of dust  happy thou art not 
for what thou hast not  still thou strivest to get 
and what thou hast  forget st  thou art not certain 
for thy complexion shifts to strange effects 
after the moon  if thou art rich  thou poor 
for  like an ass whose back with ingots bows 
thou bear thy heavy riches but a journey 
and death unloads thee  friend hast thou none 
for thine own bowels  which do call thee sire 
the mere effusion of thy proper loins 
do curse the gout  serpigo  and the rheum 
for ending thee no sooner  thou hast nor youth nor age 
but  as it were  an after dinner sleep 
dreaming on both  for all thy blessed youth
becomes as aged  and doth beg the alms
of palsied eld  and when thou art old and rich 
thou hast neither heat  affection  limb  nor beauty 
to make thy riches pleasant  what yet in this
that bears the name of life  yet in this life
lie hid moe thousand deaths  yet death we fear 
that makes these odds all even 


claudio

i humbly thank you 
to sue to live  i find i seek to die 
and  seeking death  find life  let it come on 


isabella

 within   what  ho  peace here  grace and good company 


provost

who there  come in  the wish deserves a welcome 


duke vincentio

dear sir  ere long i visit you again 


claudio

most holy sir  i thank you 
enter isabella


isabella

my business is a word or two with claudio 


provost

and very welcome  look  signior  here your sister 


duke vincentio

provost  a word with you 


provost

as many as you please 


duke vincentio

bring me to hear them speak  where i may be concealed 
exeunt duke vincentio and provost


claudio

now  sister  what the comfort 


isabella

why 
as all comforts are  most good  most good indeed 
lord angelo  having affairs to heaven 
intends you for his swift ambassador 
where you shall be an everlasting leiger 
therefore your best appointment make with speed 
to morrow you set on 


claudio

is there no remedy 


isabella

none  but such remedy as  to save a head 
to cleave a heart in twain 


claudio

but is there any 


isabella

yes  brother  you may live 
there is a devilish mercy in the judge 
if you implore it  that will free your life 
but fetter you till death 


claudio

perpetual durance 


isabella

ay  just  perpetual durance  a restraint 
though all the world vastidity you had 
to a determined scope 


claudio

but in what nature 


isabella

in such a one as  you consenting to t 
would bark your honour from that trunk you bear 
and leave you naked 


claudio

let me know the point 


isabella

o  i do fear thee  claudio  and i quake 
lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain 
and six or seven winters more respect
than a perpetual honour  darest thou die 
the sense of death is most in apprehension 
and the poor beetle  that we tread upon 
in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
as when a giant dies 


claudio

why give you me this shame 
think you i can a resolution fetch
from flowery tenderness  if i must die 
i will encounter darkness as a bride 
and hug it in mine arms 


isabella

there spake my brother  there my father grave
did utter forth a voice  yes  thou must die 
thou art too noble to conserve a life
in base appliances  this outward sainted deputy 
whose settled visage and deliberate word
nips youth i  the head and follies doth emmew
as falcon doth the fowl  is yet a devil
his filth within being cast  he would appear
a pond as deep as hell 


claudio

the prenzie angelo 


isabella

o   the cunning livery of hell 
the damned body to invest and cover
in prenzie guards  dost thou think  claudio 
if i would yield him my virginity 
thou mightst be freed 


claudio

o heavens  it cannot be 


isabella

yes  he would give thee  from this rank offence 
so to offend him still  this night the time
that i should do what i abhor to name 
or else thou diest to morrow 


claudio

thou shalt not do t 


isabella

o  were it but my life 
i throw it down for your deliverance
as frankly as a pin 


claudio

thanks  dear isabel 


isabella

be ready  claudio  for your death tomorrow 


claudio

yes  has he affections in him 
that thus can make him bite the law by the nose 
when he would force it  sure  it is no sin 
or of the deadly seven  it is the least 


isabella

which is the least 


claudio

if it were damnable  he being so wise 
why would he for the momentary trick
be perdurably fined  o isabel 


isabella

what says my brother 


claudio

death is a fearful thing 


isabella

and shamed life a hateful 


claudio

ay  but to die  and go we know not where 
to lie in cold obstruction and to rot 
this sensible warm motion to become
a kneaded clod  and the delighted spirit
to bathe in fiery floods  or to reside
in thrilling region of thick ribbed ice 
to be imprison in the viewless winds 
and blown with restless violence round about
the pendent world  or to be worse than worst
of those that lawless and incertain thought
imagine howling   too horrible 
the weariest and most loathed worldly life
that age  ache  penury and imprisonment
can lay on nature is a paradise
to what we fear of death 


isabella

alas  alas 


claudio

          sweet sister  let me live 
what sin you do to save a brother life 
nature dispenses with the deed so far
that it becomes a virtue 


isabella

o you beast 
o faithless coward  o dishonest wretch 
wilt thou be made a man out of my vice 
is not a kind of incest  to take life
from thine own sister shame  what should i think 
heaven shield my mother play my father fair 
for such a warped slip of wilderness
ne issued from his blood  take my defiance 
die  perish  might but my bending down
reprieve thee from thy fate  it should proceed 
i pray a thousand prayers for thy death 
no word to save thee 


claudio

nay  hear me  isabel 


isabella

o  fie  fie  fie 
thy sin not accidental  but a trade 
mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd 
 best thou diest quickly 


claudio

o hear me  isabella 
re enter duke vincentio


duke vincentio

vouchsafe a word  young sister  but one word 


isabella

what is your will 


duke vincentio

might you dispense with your leisure  i would by and
by have some speech with you  the satisfaction i
would require is likewise your own benefit 


isabella

i have no superfluous leisure  my stay must be
stolen out of other affairs  but i will attend you awhile 
walks apart


duke vincentio

son  i have overheard what hath passed between you
and your sister  angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her  only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
of natures  she  having the truth of honour in her 
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
glad to receive  i am confessor to angelo  and i
know this to be true  therefore prepare yourself to
death  do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
that are fallible  tomorrow you must die  go to
your knees and make ready 


claudio

let me ask my sister pardon  i am so out of love
with life that i will sue to be rid of it 


duke vincentio

hold you there  farewell 
exit claudio
provost  a word with you 
re enter provost


provost

what your will  father


duke vincentio

that now you are come  you will be gone  leave me
awhile with the maid  my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company 


provost

in good time 
exit provost  isabella comes forward


duke vincentio

the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good 
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness  but grace  being the soul of
your complexion  shall keep the body of it ever
fair  the assault that angelo hath made to you 
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding  and  but
that frailty hath examples for his falling  i should
wonder at angelo  how will you do to content this
substitute  and to save your brother 


isabella

i am now going to resolve him  i had rather my
brother die by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born  but  o  how much is the good duke
deceived in angelo  if ever he return and i can
speak to him  i will open my lips in vain  or
discover his government 


duke vincentio

that shall not be much amiss  yet  as the matter
now stands  he will avoid your accusation  he made
trial of you only  therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings  to the love i have in doing good a
remedy presents itself  i do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit  redeem your brother from
the angry law  do no stain to your own gracious
person  and much please the absent duke  if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
this business 


isabella

let me hear you speak farther  i have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit 


duke vincentio

virtue is bold  and goodness never fearful  have
you not heard speak of mariana  the sister of
frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea 


isabella

i have heard of the lady  and good words went with her name 


duke vincentio

she should this angelo have married  was affianced
to her by oath  and the nuptial appointed  between
which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity  her brother frederick was wrecked at sea 
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister  but mark how heavily this befell to the
poor gentlewoman  there she lost a noble and
renowned brother  in his love toward her ever most
kind and natural  with him  the portion and sinew of
her fortune  her marriage dowry  with both  her
combinate husband  this well seeming angelo 


isabella

can this be so  did angelo so leave her 


duke vincentio

left her in her tears  and dried not one of them
with his comfort  swallowed his vows whole 
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour  in few 
bestowed her on her own lamentation  which she yet
wears for his sake  and he  a marble to her tears 
is washed with them  but relents not 


isabella

what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
from the world  what corruption in this life  that
it will let this man live  but how out of this can she avail 


duke vincentio

it is a rupture that you may easily heal  and the
cure of it not only saves your brother  but keeps
you from dishonour in doing it 


isabella

show me how  good father 


duke vincentio

this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection  his unjust unkindness  that
in all reason should have quenched her love  hath 
like an impediment in the current  made it more
violent and unruly  go you to angelo  answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience  agree with
his demands to the point  only refer yourself to
this advantage  first  that your stay with him may
not be long  that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it  and the place answer to convenience 
this being granted in course and now follows
all we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
your appointment  go in your place  if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter  it may compel him to
her recompense  and here  by this  is your brother
saved  your honour untainted  the poor mariana
advantaged  and the corrupt deputy scaled  the maid
will i frame and make fit for his attempt  if you
think well to carry this as you may  the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof 
what think you of it 


isabella

the image of it gives me content already  and i
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection 


duke vincentio

it lies much in your holding up  haste you speedily
to angelo  if for this night he entreat you to his
bed  give him promise of satisfaction  i will
presently to saint luke s  there  at the moated
grange  resides this dejected mariana  at that
place call upon me  and dispatch with angelo  that
it may be quickly 


isabella

i thank you for this comfort  fare you well  good father 
exeunt severally
