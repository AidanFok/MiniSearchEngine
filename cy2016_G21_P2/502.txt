pompey

 never merry world since  of two usuries  the
merriest was put down  and the worser allowed by
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm  and
furred with fox and lamb skins too  to signify  that
craft  being richer than innocency  stands for the facing 


elbow

this man made you  sir

take him to be a thief too  sir  for we have found
upon him  sir  a strange picklock  which we have
sent to the deputy 


duke vincentio

fie  sirrah  a bawd  a wicked bawd

that is thy means to live  do thou but think
what  to cram a maw or clothe a back
from such a filthy vice  say to thyself 
from their abominable and beastly touches
i drink  i eat  array myself  and live 
canst thou believe thy living is a life 
so stinkingly depending  go mend  go mend 


pompey

indeed  it does stink in some sort  sir  but yet 
sir  i would prove 


duke vincentio

nay  if the devil have given thee proofs for sin 
thou wilt prove his  take him to prison  officer 
correction and instruction must both work
ere this rude beast will profit 


elbow

he must before the deputy  sir  he has given him
warning  the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster  if
he be a whoremonger  and comes before him  he were
as good go a mile on his errand 


duke vincentio

that we were all  as some would seem to be 
from our faults  as faults from seeming  free 


elbow

his neck will come to your waist a cord  sir 


pompey

i spy comfort  i cry bail  here a gentleman and a
friend of mine

lucio

how now  noble pompey  what  at the wheels of
caesar  art thou led in triumph  what  is there
none of pygmalion images  newly made woman  to be
had now  for putting the hand in the pocket and
extracting it clutch d  what reply  ha  what
sayest thou to this tune  matter and method  is 
not drowned i  the last rain  ha  what sayest
thou  trot  is the world as it was  man  which is
the way  is it sad  and few words  or how  the
trick of it 


duke vincentio

still thus  and thus  still worse 


lucio

how doth my dear morsel  thy mistress  procures she
still  ha 


pompey

troth  sir  she hath eaten up all her beef  and she
is herself in the tub 


lucio

why   good  it is the right of it  it must be
so  ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd 
an unshunned consequence  it must be so  art going
to prison  pompey 


pompey

yes  faith  sir 


lucio

why   not amiss  pompey  farewell  go  say i
sent thee thither  for debt  pompey  or how 


elbow

for being a bawd  for being a bawd 


lucio

well  then  imprison him  if imprisonment be the
due of a bawd  why   his right  bawd is he
doubtless  and of antiquity too  bawd born 
farewell  good pompey  commend me to the prison 
pompey  you will turn good husband now  pompey  you
will keep the house 


pompey

i hope  sir  your good worship will be my bail 


lucio

no  indeed  will i not  pompey  it is not the wear 
i will pray  pompey  to increase your bondage  if
you take it not patiently  why  your mettle is the
more  adieu  trusty pompey   you  friar 


duke vincentio

and you 


lucio

does bridget paint still  pompey  ha 


elbow

come your ways  sir  come 


pompey

you will not bail me  then  sir 


lucio

then  pompey  nor now  what news abroad  friar 
what news 


elbow

come your ways  sir  come 


lucio

go to kennel  pompey  go 
exeunt elbow  pompey and officers
what news  friar  of the duke 


duke vincentio

i know none  can you tell me of any 


lucio

some say he is with the emperor of russia  other
some  he is in rome  but where is he  think you 


duke vincentio

i know not where  but wheresoever  i wish him well 


lucio

it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
the state  and usurp the beggary he was never born
to  lord angelo dukes it well in his absence  he
puts transgression to  t 


duke vincentio

he does well in  t 


lucio

a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
him  something too crabbed that way  friar 


duke vincentio

it is too general a vice  and severity must cure it 


lucio

yes  in good sooth  the vice is of a great kindred 
it is well allied  but it is impossible to extirp
it quite  friar  till eating and drinking be put
down  they say this angelo was not made by man and
woman after this downright way of creation  is it
true  think you 


duke vincentio

how should he be made  then 


lucio

some report a sea maid spawned him  some  that he
was begot between two stock fishes  but it is
certain that when he makes water his urine is
congealed ice  that i know to be true  and he is a
motion generative  that infallible 


duke vincentio

you are pleasant  sir  and speak apace 


lucio

why  what a ruthless thing is this in him  for the
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man  would the duke that is absent have done this 
ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
hundred bastards  he would have paid for the nursing
a thousand  he had some feeling of the sport  he
knew the service  and that instructed him to mercy 


duke vincentio

i never heard the absent duke much detected for
women  he was not inclined that way 


lucio

o  sir  you are deceived 


duke vincentio

 not possible 


lucio

who  not the duke  yes  your beggar of fifty  and
his use was to put a ducat in her clack dish  the
duke had crotchets in him  he would be drunk too 
that let me inform you 


duke vincentio

you do him wrong  surely 


lucio

sir  i was an inward of his  a shy fellow was the
duke  and i believe i know the cause of his
withdrawing 


duke vincentio

what  i prithee  might be the cause 


lucio

no  pardon   a secret must be locked within the
teeth and the lips  but this i can let you
understand  the greater file of the subject held the
duke to be wise 


duke vincentio

wise  why  no question but he was 


lucio

a very superficial  ignorant  unweighing fellow 


duke vincentio

either this is the envy in you  folly  or mistaking 
the very stream of his life and the business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation  let him be but testimonied in his own
bringings forth  and he shall appear to the
envious a scholar  a statesman and a soldier 
therefore you speak unskilfully  or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice 


lucio

sir  i know him  and i love him 


duke vincentio

love talks with better knowledge  and knowledge with
dearer love 


lucio

come  sir  i know what i know 


duke vincentio

i can hardly believe that  since you know not what
you speak  but  if ever the duke return  as our
prayers are he may  let me desire you to make your
answer before him  if it be honest you have spoke 
you have courage to maintain it  i am bound to call
upon you  and  i pray you  your name 


lucio

sir  my name is lucio  well known to the duke 


duke vincentio

he shall know you better  sir  if i may live to
report you 


lucio

i fear you not 


duke vincentio

o  you hope the duke will return no more  or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite  but indeed i
can do you little harm  you forswear this again 


lucio

i be hanged first  thou art deceived in me 
friar  but no more of this  canst thou tell if
claudio die to morrow or no 


duke vincentio

why should he die  sir 


lucio

why  for filling a bottle with a tundish  i would
the duke we talk of were returned again  the
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
continency  sparrows must not build in his
house eaves  because they are lecherous  the duke
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered  he would
never bring them to light  would he were returned 
marry  this claudio is condemned for untrussing 
farewell  good friar  i prithee  pray for me  the
duke  i say to thee again  would eat mutton on
fridays  he not past it yet  and i say to thee 
he would mouth with a beggar  though she smelt brown
bread and garlic  say that i said so  farewell 
exit


duke vincentio

no might nor greatness in mortality
can censure  scape  back wounding calumny
the whitest virtue strikes  what king so strong
can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue 
but who comes here 
enter escalus  provost  and officers with mistress overdone


escalus

go  away with her to prison 


mistress overdone

good my lord  be good to me  your honour is accounted
a merciful man  good my lord 


escalus

double and treble admonition  and still forfeit in
the same kind  this would make mercy swear and play
the tyrant 


provost

a bawd of eleven years  continuance  may it please
your honour 


mistress overdone

my lord  this is one lucio information against me 
mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the
duke time  he promised her marriage  his child
is a year and a quarter old  come philip and jacob 
i have kept it myself  and see how he goes about to abuse me 


escalus

that fellow is a fellow of much licence  let him be
called before us  away with her to prison  go to 
no more words 
exeunt officers with mistress overdone
provost  my brother angelo will not be altered 
claudio must die to morrow  let him be furnished
with divines  and have all charitable preparation 
if my brother wrought by my pity  it should not be
so with him 


provost

so please you  this friar hath been with him  and
advised him for the entertainment of death 


escalus

good even  good father 


duke vincentio

bliss and goodness on you 


escalus

of whence are you 


duke vincentio

not of this country  though my chance is now
to use it for my time  i am a brother
of gracious order  late come from the see
in special business from his holiness 


escalus

what news abroad i  the world 


duke vincentio

none  but that there is so great a fever on
goodness  that the dissolution of it must cure it 
novelty is only in request  and it is as dangerous
to be aged in any kind of course  as it is virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking  there is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure  but
security enough to make fellowships accurst  much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world  this
news is old enough  yet it is every day news  i
pray you  sir  of what disposition was the duke 


escalus

one that  above all other strifes  contended
especially to know himself 


duke vincentio

what pleasure was he given to 


escalus

rather rejoicing to see another merry  than merry at
any thing which professed to make him rejoice  a
gentleman of all temperance  but leave we him to
his events  with a prayer they may prove prosperous 
and let me desire to know how you find claudio
prepared  i am made to understand that you have
lent him visitation 


duke vincentio

he professes to have received no sinister measure
from his judge  but most willingly humbles himself
to the determination of justice  yet had he framed
to himself  by the instruction of his frailty  many
deceiving promises of life  which i by my good
leisure have discredited to him  and now is he
resolved to die 


escalus

you have paid the heavens your function  and the
prisoner the very debt of your calling  i have
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty  but my brother justice have i
found so severe  that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed justice 


duke vincentio

if his own life answer the straitness of his
proceeding  it shall become him well  wherein if he
chance to fail  he hath sentenced himself 


escalus

i am going to visit the prisoner  fare you well 


duke vincentio

peace be with you 
exeunt escalus and provost
he who the sword of heaven will bear
should be as holy as severe 
pattern in himself to know 
grace to stand  and virtue go 
more nor less to others paying
than by self offences weighing 
shame to him whose cruel striking
kills for faults of his own liking 
twice treble shame on angelo 
to weed my vice and let his grow 
o  what may man within him hide 
though angel on the outward side 
how may likeness made in crimes 
making practise on the times 
to draw with idle spiders  strings
most ponderous and substantial things 
craft against vice i must apply 
with angelo to night shall lie
his old betrothed but despised 
so disguise shall  by the disguised 
pay with falsehood false exacting 
and perform an old contracting 
exit
