enter mariana and a boy


boy sings


take  o  take those lips away 
that so sweetly were forsworn 
and those eyes  the break of day 
lights that do mislead the morn 
but my kisses bring again  bring again 
seals of love  but sealed in vain  sealed in vain

hath often still my brawling discontent

you had not found me here so musical 
let me excuse me  and believe me so

to make bad good  and good provoke to harm

upon thy doings  thousand escapes of wit
make thee the father of their idle dreams
and rack thee in their fancies 
re enter mariana and isabella
welcome  how agreed 


isabella

she take the enterprise upon her  father 
if you advise it

to bring you thus together   no sin

doth flourish the deceit  come  let us go 
our corn to reap  for yet our tithe to sow
