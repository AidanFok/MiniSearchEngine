executioner  who in his office lacks a helper  if
you will take it on you to assist him  it shall
redeem you from your gyves  if not  you shall have
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
with an unpitied whipping  for you have been a
notorious bawd 


pompey

would be glad to receive some instruction from my
fellow partner

pompey

painting  sir  i have heard say  is a mystery  and
your whores  sir  being members of my occupation 
using painting  do prove my occupation a mystery 
but what mystery there should be in hanging  if i
should be hanged  i cannot imagine 


abhorson

sir  it is a mystery 


pompey

proof 


abhorson

every true man apparel fits your thief  if it be
too little for your thief  your true man thinks it
big enough  if it be too big for your thief  your
thief thinks it little enough  so every true man 
apparel fits your thief 
re enter provost


provost

are you agreed 


pompey

sir  i will serve him  for i do find your hangman is
a more penitent trade than your bawd  he doth
oftener ask forgiveness 


provost

to morrow four o clock 


abhorson

come on  bawd  i will instruct thee in my trade  follow

a good turn

being a murderer  though he were my brother 
enter claudio
look  here the warrant  claudio  for thy death 
 now dead midnight  and by eight to morrow
thou must be made immortal  where barnardine 


claudio

as fast lock up in sleep as guiltless labour
when it lies starkly in the traveller bones 
he will not wake 


provost

                  who can do good on him 
well  go  prepare yourself 
knocking within
but  hark  what noise 
heaven give your spirits comfort 
exit claudio
by and by 
i hope it is some pardon or reprieve
for the most gentle claudio 
enter duke vincentio disguised as before
welcome father 


duke vincentio

the best and wholesomest spirts of the night
envelope you  good provost  who call here of late 


provost

none  since the curfew rung 


duke vincentio

not isabel 


provost

          no 


duke vincentio

                  they will  then  ere be long 


provost

what comfort is for claudio 


duke vincentio

there some in hope 


provost

it is a bitter deputy 


duke vincentio

not so  not so  his life is parallel 
even with the stroke and line of his great justice 
he doth with holy abstinence subdue
that in himself which he spurs on his power
to qualify in others  were he meal with that
which he corrects  then were he tyrannous 
but this being so  he just 
knocking within
now are they come 
exit provost
this is a gentle provost  seldom when
the steeled gaoler is the friend of men 
knocking within
how now  what noise  that spirit possessed with haste
that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes 
re enter provost


provost

there he must stay until the officer
arise to let him in  he is call up 


duke vincentio

have you no countermand for claudio yet 
but he must die to morrow 


provost

none  sir  none 


duke vincentio

as near the dawning  provost  as it is 
you shall hear more ere morning 


provost

happily
you something know  yet i believe there comes
no countermand  no such example have we 
besides  upon the very siege of justice
lord angelo hath to the public ear
profess the contrary 
enter a messenger
this is his lordship man 


duke vincentio

and here comes claudio pardon 


messenger

 giving a paper 
my lord hath sent you this note  and by me this
further charge  that you swerve not from the
smallest article of it  neither in time  matter  or
other circumstance  good morrow  for  as i take it 
it is almost day 


provost

i shall obey him 
exit messenger


duke vincentio

 aside   this is his pardon  purchased by such sin
for which the pardoner himself is in 
hence hath offence his quick celerity 
when it is born in high authority 
when vice makes mercy  mercy so extended 
that for the fault love is the offender friended 
now  sir  what news 


provost

i told you  lord angelo  belike thinking me remiss
in mine office  awakens me with this unwonted
putting on  methinks strangely  for he hath not used it before 


duke vincentio

pray you  let hear 


provost

 reads 
 you may hear to the contrary  let
claudio be executed by four of the clock  and in the
afternoon barnardine  for my better satisfaction 
let me have claudio head sent me by five  let
this be duly performed  with a thought that more
depends on it than we must yet deliver  thus fail
not to do your office  as you will answer it at your peril 
what say you to this  sir 


duke vincentio

what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the
afternoon 


provost

a bohemian born  but here nursed un and bred  one
that is a prisoner nine years old 


duke vincentio

how came it that the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him  i
have heard it was ever his manner to do so 


provost

his friends still wrought reprieves for him  and 
indeed  his fact  till now in the government of lord
angelo  came not to an undoubtful proof 


duke vincentio

it is now apparent 


provost

most manifest  and not denied by himself 


duke vincentio

hath he born himself penitently in prison  how
seems he to be touched 


provost

a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep  careless  reckless  and fearless
of what past  present  or to come  insensible of
mortality  and desperately mortal 


duke vincentio

he wants advice 


provost

he will hear none  he hath evermore had the liberty
of the prison  give him leave to escape hence  he
would not  drunk many times a day  if not many days
entirely drunk  we have very oft awaked him  as if
to carry him to execution  and showed him a seeming
warrant for it  it hath not moved him at all 


duke vincentio

more of him anon  there is written in your brow 
provost  honesty and constancy  if i read it not
truly  my ancient skill beguiles me  but  in the
boldness of my cunning  i will lay myself in hazard 
claudio  whom here you have warrant to execute  is
no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath
sentenced him  to make you understand this in a
manifested effect  i crave but four days  respite 
for the which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy 


provost

pray  sir  in what 


duke vincentio

in the delaying death 


provost

a lack  how may i do it  having the hour limited 
and an express command  under penalty  to deliver
his head in the view of angelo  i may make my case
as claudio s  to cross this in the smallest 


duke vincentio

by the vow of mine order i warrant you  if my
instructions may be your guide  let this barnardine
be this morning executed  and his head born to angelo 


provost

angelo hath seen them both  and will discover the favour 


duke vincentio

o  death a great disguiser  and you may add to it 
shave the head  and tie the beard  and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
death  you know the course is common  if any thing
fall to you upon this  more than thanks and good
fortune  by the saint whom i profess  i will plead
against it with my life 


provost

pardon me  good father  it is against my oath 


duke vincentio

were you sworn to the duke  or to the deputy 


provost

to him  and to his substitutes 


duke vincentio

you will think you have made no offence  if the duke
avouch the justice of your dealing 


provost

but what likelihood is in that 


duke vincentio

not a resemblance  but a certainty  yet since i see
you fearful  that neither my coat  integrity  nor
persuasion can with ease attempt you  i will go
further than i meant  to pluck all fears out of you 
look you  sir  here is the hand and seal of the
duke  you know the character  i doubt not  and the
signet is not strange to you 


provost

i know them both 


duke vincentio

the contents of this is the return of the duke  you
shall anon over read it at your pleasure  where you
shall find  within these two days he will be here 
this is a thing that angelo knows not  for he this
very day receives letters of strange tenor 
perchance of the duke death  perchance entering
into some monastery  but  by chance  nothing of what
is writ  look  the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd  put not yourself into amazement how these
things should be  all difficulties are but easy
when they are known  call your executioner  and off
with barnardine head  i will give him a present
shrift and advise him for a better place  yet you
are amazed  but this shall absolutely resolve you 
come away  it is almost clear dawn 
exeunt
