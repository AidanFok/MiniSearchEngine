scene iv  a room in angelo house 


enter angelo and escalus


escalus

every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other 


angelo

in most uneven and distracted manner  his actions
show much like to madness  pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted  and why meet him at the gates  and
redeliver our authorities there


escalus

i guess not 


angelo

and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
entering  that if any crave redress of injustice 
they should exhibit their petitions in the street 


escalus

he shows his reason for that  to have a dispatch of
complaints  and to deliver us from devices
hereafter  which shall then have no power to stand
against us 


angelo

well  i beseech you  let it be proclaimed betimes
i  the morn  i call you at your house  give
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him 


escalus

i shall  sir  fare you well 


angelo

good night 
exit escalus
this deed unshapes me quite  makes me unpregnant
and dull to all proceedings  a deflower maid 
and by an eminent body that enforced
the law against it  but that her tender shame
will not proclaim against her maiden loss 
how might she tongue me  yet reason dares her no 
for my authority bears of a credent bulk 
that no particular scandal once can touch
but it confounds the breather  he should have lived 
save that riotous youth  with dangerous sense 
might in the times to come have ta revenge 
by so receiving a dishonour life
with ransom of such shame  would yet he had lived 
a lack  when once our grace we have forgot 
nothing goes right  we would  and we would not 
exit
