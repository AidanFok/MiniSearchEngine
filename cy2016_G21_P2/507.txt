duke vincentio

these letters at fit time deliver me
giving letters
the provost knows our purpose and our plot 
the matter being afoot  keep your instruction 
and hold you ever to our special drift 
though sometimes you do blench from this to that 
as cause doth minister  go call at flavius  house 
and tell him where i stay  give the like notice
to valentinus  rowland  and to crassus 
and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate 
but send me flavius first 


friar peter

it shall be speeded well 
exit
enter varrius


duke vincentio

i thank thee  varrius  thou hast made good haste 
come  we will walk  there other of our friends
will greet us here anon  my gentle varrius 
exeunt
