duke vincentio

my very worthy cousin  fairly met 
our old and faithful friend  we are glad to see you 


angelo

escalus

happy return be to your royal grace 


duke vincentio

many and hearty thankings to you both 
we have made inquiry of you  and we hear
such goodness of your justice  that our soul
cannot but yield you forth to public thanks 
forerunning more requital 


angelo

you make my bonds still greater 


duke vincentio

o  your desert speaks loud  and i should wrong it 
to lock it in the wards of covert bosom 
when it deserves  with characters of brass 
a forted residence  the tooth of time
and razure of oblivion  give me your hand 
and let the subject see  to make them know
that outward courtesies would fain proclaim
favours that keep within  come  escalus 
you must walk by us on our other hand 
and good supporters are you 
friar peter and isabella come forward


friar peter

now is your time  speak loud and kneel before him 


isabella

justice  o royal duke  vail your regard
upon a wrong d  i would fain have said  a maid 
o worthy prince  dishonour not your eye
by throwing it on any other object
till you have heard me in my true complaint
and given me justice  justice  justice  justice 


duke vincentio

relate your wrongs  in what  by whom  be brief 
here is lord angelo shall give you justice 
reveal yourself to him 


isabella

o worthy duke 
you bid me seek redemption of the devil 
hear me yourself  for that which i must speak
must either punish me  not being believed 
or wring redress from you  hear me  o hear me  here 


angelo

my lord  her wits  i fear me  are not firm 
she hath been a suitor to me for her brother
cut off by course of justice 


isabella

by course of justice 


angelo

and she will speak most bitterly and strange 


isabella

most strange  but yet most truly  will i speak 
that angelo forsworn  is it not strange 
that angelo a murderer  is  not strange 
that angelo is an adulterous thief 
an hypocrite  a virgin violator 
is it not strange and strange 


duke vincentio

nay  it is ten times strange 


isabella

it is not truer he is angelo
than this is all as true as it is strange 
nay  it is ten times true  for truth is truth
to the end of reckoning 


duke vincentio

away with her  poor soul 
she speaks this in the infirmity of sense 


isabella

o prince  i conjure thee  as thou believest
there is another comfort than this world 
that thou neglect me not  with that opinion
that i am touch with madness  make not impossible
that which but seems unlike   not impossible
but one  the wicked caitiff on the ground 
may seem as shy  as grave  as just  as absolute
as angelo  even so may angelo 
in all his dressings  characts  titles  forms 
be an arch villain  believe it  royal prince 
if he be less  he nothing  but he more 
had i more name for badness 


duke vincentio

by mine honesty 
if she be mad as i believe no other 
her madness hath the oddest frame of sense 
such a dependency of thing on thing 
as e i heard in madness 


isabella

o gracious duke 
harp not on that  nor do not banish reason
for inequality  but let your reason serve
to make the truth appear where it seems hid 
and hide the false seems true 


duke vincentio

many that are not mad
have  sure  more lack of reason  what would you say 


isabella

i am the sister of one claudio 
condemn upon the act of fornication
to lose his head  condemn by angelo 
i  in probation of a sisterhood 
was sent to by my brother  one lucio
as then the messenger 


lucio

that i  an like your grace 
i came to her from claudio  and desired her
to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo
for her poor brother pardon 


isabella

that he indeed 


duke vincentio

you were not bid to speak 


lucio

no  my good lord 
nor wish to hold my peace 


duke vincentio

i wish you now  then 
pray you  take note of it  and when you have
a business for yourself  pray heaven you then
be perfect 


lucio

i warrant your honour 


duke vincentio

the warrants for yourself  take heed to t 


isabella

this gentleman told somewhat of my tale 


lucio

right 


duke vincentio

it may be right  but you are i  the wrong
to speak before your time  proceed 


isabella

i went
to this pernicious caitiff deputy 


duke vincentio

that somewhat madly spoken 


isabella

pardon it 
the phrase is to the matter 


duke vincentio

mended again  the matter  proceed 


isabella

in brief  to set the needless process by 
how i persuaded  how i pray d  and kneel d 
how he refell me  and how i replied 
for this was of much length the vile conclusion
i now begin with grief and shame to utter 
he would not  but by gift of my chaste body
to his concupiscible intemperate lust 
release my brother  and  after much debatement 
my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour 
and i did yield to him  but the next morn betimes 
his purpose surfeiting  he sends a warrant
for my poor brother head 


duke vincentio

this is most likely 


isabella

o  that it were as like as it is true 


duke vincentio

by heaven  fond wretch  thou knowist not what thou speak st 
or else thou art suborn against his honour
in hateful practise  first  his integrity
stands without blemish  next  it imports no reason
that with such vehemency he should pursue
faults proper to himself  if he had so offended 
he would have weigh thy brother by himself
and not have cut him off  some one hath set you on 
confess the truth  and say by whose advice
thou camest here to complain 


isabella

and is this all 
then  o you blessed ministers above 
keep me in patience  and with ripen time
unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
in countenance  heaven shield your grace from woe 
as i  thus wrong d  hence unbelieved go 


duke vincentio

i know you fain be gone  an officer 
to prison with her  shall we thus permit
a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
on him so near us  this needs must be a practise 
who knew of your intent and coming hither 


isabella

one that i would were here  friar lodowick 


duke vincentio

a ghostly father  belike  who knows that lodowick 


lucio

my lord  i know him   a meddling friar 
i do not like the man  had he been lay  my lord
for certain words he spake against your grace
in your retirement  i had swinged him soundly 


duke vincentio

words against me  this is a good friar  belike 
and to set on this wretched woman here
against our substitute  let this friar be found 


lucio

but yesternight  my lord  she and that friar 
i saw them at the prison  a saucy friar 
a very scurvy fellow 


friar peter

blessed be your royal grace 
i have stood by  my lord  and i have heard
your royal ear abused  first  hath this woman
most wrongfully accused your substitute 
who is as free from touch or soil with her
as she from one ungot 


duke vincentio

we did believe no less 
know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of 


friar peter

i know him for a man divine and holy 
not scurvy  nor a temporary meddler 
as he reported by this gentleman 
and  on my trust  a man that never yet
did  as he vouches  misreport your grace 


lucio

my lord  most villanously  believe it 


friar peter

well  he in time may come to clear himself 
but at this instant he is sick my lord 
of a strange fever  upon his mere request 
being come to knowledge that there was complaint
intended  lord angelo  came i hither 
to speak  as from his mouth  what he doth know
is true and false  and what he with his oath
and all probation will make up full clear 
whensoever he convented  first  for this woman 
to justify this worthy nobleman 
so vulgarly and personally accused 
her shall you hear disproved to her eyes 
till she herself confess it 


duke vincentio

good friar  let hear it 
isabella is carried off guarded  and mariana comes forward
do you not smile at this  lord angelo 
o heaven  the vanity of wretched fools 
give us some seats  come  cousin angelo 
in this i be impartial  be you judge
of your own cause  is this the witness  friar 
first  let her show her face  and after speak 


mariana

pardon  my lord  i will not show my face
until my husband bid me 


duke vincentio

what  are you married 


mariana

no  my lord 


duke vincentio

are you a maid 


mariana

no  my lord 


duke vincentio

a widow  then 


mariana

neither  my lord 


duke vincentio

why  you are nothing then  neither maid  widow  nor wife 


lucio

my lord  she may be a punk  for many of them are
neither maid  widow  nor wife 


duke vincentio

silence that fellow  i would he had some cause
to prattle for himself 


lucio

well  my lord 


mariana

my lord  i do confess i ne was married 
and i confess besides i am no maid 
i have known my husband  yet my husband
knows not that ever he knew me 


lucio

he was drunk then  my lord  it can be no better 


duke vincentio

for the benefit of silence  would thou wert so too 


lucio

well  my lord 


duke vincentio

this is no witness for lord angelo 


mariana

now i come to my lord
she that accuses him of fornication 
in self same manner doth accuse my husband 
and charges him my lord  with such a time
when i depose i had him in mine arms
with all the effect of love 


angelo

charges she more than me 


mariana

not that i know 


duke vincentio

no  you say your husband 


mariana

why  just  my lord  and that is angelo 
who thinks he knows that he ne knew my body 
but knows he thinks that he knows isabel s 


angelo

this is a strange abuse  let see thy face 


mariana

my husband bids me  now i will unmask 
unveiling
this is that face  thou cruel angelo 
which once thou sworest was worth the looking on 
this is the hand which  with a vow contract 
was fast belock in thine  this is the body
that took away the match from isabel 
and did supply thee at thy garden house
in her imagined person 


duke vincentio

know you this woman 


lucio

carnally  she says 


duke vincentio

sirrah  no more 


lucio

enough  my lord 


angelo

my lord  i must confess i know this woman 
and five years since there was some speech of marriage
betwixt myself and her  which was broke off 
partly for that her promised proportions
came short of composition  but in chief
for that her reputation was disvalued
in levity  since which time of five years
i never spake with her  saw her  nor heard from her 
upon my faith and honour 


mariana

noble prince 
as there comes light from heaven and words from breath 
as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue 
i am affianced this man wife as strongly
as words could make up vows  and  my good lord 
but tuesday night last gone in garden house
he knew me as a wife  as this is true 
let me in safety raise me from my knees
or else for ever be confixed here 
a marble monument 


angelo

                  i did but smile till now 
now  good my lord  give me the scope of justice
my patience here is touch d  i do perceive
these poor informal women are no more
but instruments of some more mightier member
that sets them on  let me have way  my lord 
to find this practise out 


duke vincentio

ay  with my heart
and punish them to your height of pleasure 
thou foolish friar  and thou pernicious woman 
compact with her that gone  think thou thy oaths 
though they would swear down each particular saint 
were testimonies against his worth and credit
that seal in approbation  you  lord escalus 
sit with my cousin  lend him your kind pains
to find out this abuse  whence  derived 
there is another friar that set them on 
let him be sent for 


friar peter

would he were here  my lord  for he indeed
hath set the women on to this complaint 
your provost knows the place where he abides
and he may fetch him 


duke vincentio

go do it instantly 
exit provost
and you  my noble and well warranted cousin 
whom it concerns to hear this matter forth 
do with your injuries as seems you best 
in any chastisement  i for a while will leave you 
but stir not you till you have well determined
upon these slanderers 


escalus

my lord  we do it throughly 
exit duke
signior lucio  did not you say you knew that
friar lodowick to be a dishonest person 


lucio

 non facit monachum  honest in nothing
but in his clothes  and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the duke 


escalus

we shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him  we shall find this friar a
notable fellow 


lucio

as any in vienna  on my word 


escalus

call that same isabel here once again  i would speak with her 
exit an attendant
pray you  my lord  give me leave to question  you
shall see how i handle her 


lucio

not better than he  by her own report 


escalus

say you 


lucio

marry  sir  i think  if you handled her privately 
she would sooner confess  perchance  publicly 
she be ashamed 


escalus

i will go darkly to work with her 


lucio

that the way  for women are light at midnight 
re enter officers with isabella  and provost with the duke vincentio in his friar habit


escalus

come on  mistress  here a gentlewoman denies all
that you have said 


lucio

my lord  here comes the rascal i spoke of  here with
the provost 


escalus

in very good time  speak not you to him till we
call upon you 


lucio

mum 


escalus

come  sir  did you set these women on to slander
lord angelo  they have confessed you did 


duke vincentio

 false 


escalus

how  know you where you are 


duke vincentio

respect to your great place  and let the devil
be sometime honour for his burning throne 
where is the duke   he should hear me speak 


escalus

the duke in us  and we will hear you speak 
look you speak justly 


duke vincentio

boldly  at least  but  o  poor souls 
come you to seek the lamb here of the fox 
good night to your redress  is the duke gone 
then is your cause gone too  the duke unjust 
thus to retort your manifest appeal 
and put your trial in the villain mouth
which here you come to accuse 


lucio

this is the rascal  this is he i spoke of 


escalus

why  thou unreverend and unhallow friar 
is not enough thou hast suborn these women
to accuse this worthy man  but  in foul mouth
and in the witness of his proper ear 
to call him villain  and then to glance from him
to the duke himself  to tax him with injustice 
take him hence  to the rack with him  we touse you
joint by joint  but we will know his purpose 
what  unjust 


duke vincentio

                  be not so hot  the duke
dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
dare rack his own  his subject am i not 
nor here provincial  my business in this state
made me a looker on here in vienna 
where i have seen corruption boil and bubble
till it o er run the stew  laws for all faults 
but faults so countenanced  that the strong statutes
stand like the forfeits in a barber shop 
as much in mock as mark 


escalus

slander to the state  away with him to prison 


angelo

what can you vouch against him  signior lucio 
is this the man that you did tell us of 


lucio

 he  my lord  come hither  goodman baldpate 
do you know me 


duke vincentio

i remember you  sir  by the sound of your voice  i
met you at the prison  in the absence of the duke 


lucio

o  did you so  and do you remember what you said of the duke 


duke vincentio

most notedly  sir 


lucio

do you so  sir  and was the duke a fleshmonger  a
fool  and a coward  as you then reported him to be 


duke vincentio

you must  sir  change persons with me  ere you make
that my report  you  indeed  spoke so of him  and
much more  much worse 


lucio

o thou damnable fellow  did not i pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches 


duke vincentio

i protest i love the duke as i love myself 


angelo

hark  how the villain would close now  after his
treasonable abuses 


escalus

such a fellow is not to be talked withal  away with
him to prison  where is the provost  away with him
to prison  lay bolts enough upon him  let him
speak no more  away with those giglots too  and
with the other confederate companion 


duke vincentio

angelo

what  resists he  help him  lucio 


lucio

come  sir  come  sir  come  sir  foh  sir  why  you
bald pated  lying rascal  you must be hooded  must
you  show your knave visage  with a pox to you 
show your sheep biting face  and be hanged an hour 
will not off 
pulls off the friar hood  and discovers duke vincentio


duke vincentio

thou art the first knave that e madest a duke 
first  provost  let me bail these gentle three 
to lucio
sneak not away  sir  for the friar and you
must have a word anon  lay hold on him 


lucio

this may prove worse than hanging 


duke vincentio

 to escalus   what you have spoke i pardon  sit you down 
we borrow place of him 
to angelo
sir  by your leave 
hast thou or word  or wit  or impudence 
that yet can do thee office  if thou hast 
rely upon it till my tale be heard 
and hold no longer out 


angelo

o my dread lord 
i should be guiltier than my guiltiness 
to think i can be undiscernible 
when i perceive your grace  like power divine 
hath look upon my passes  then  good prince 
no longer session hold upon my shame 
but let my trial be mine own confession 
immediate sentence then and sequent death
is all the grace i beg 


duke vincentio

come hither  mariana 
say  wast thou e contracted to this woman 


angelo

i was  my lord 


duke vincentio

go take her hence  and marry her instantly 
do you the office  friar  which consummate 
return him here again  go with him  provost 
exeunt angelo  mariana  friar peter and provost


escalus

my lord  i am more amazed at his dishonour
than at the strangeness of it 


duke vincentio

come hither  isabel 
your friar is now your prince  as i was then
advertising and holy to your business 
not changing heart with habit  i am still
attorney at your service 


isabella

o  give me pardon 
that i  your vassal  have employ and pain 
your unknown sovereignty 


duke vincentio

you are pardon d  isabel 
and now  dear maid  be you as free to us 
your brother death  i know  sits at your heart 
and you may marvel why i obscured myself 
labouring to save his life  and would not rather
make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
than let him so be lost  o most kind maid 
it was the swift celerity of his death 
which i did think with slower foot came on 
that brain my purpose  but  peace be with him 
that life is better life  past fearing death 
than that which lives to fear  make it your comfort 
so happy is your brother 


isabella

i do  my lord 
re enter angelo  mariana  friar peter  and provost


duke vincentio

for this new married man approaching here 
whose salt imagination yet hath wrong 
your well defended honour  you must pardon
for mariana sake  but as he adjudged your brother 
being criminal  in double violation
of sacred chastity and of promise breach
thereon dependent  for your brother life 
the very mercy of the law cries out
most audible  even from his proper tongue 
 angelo for claudio  death for death 
haste still pays haste  and leisure answers leisure 
like doth quit like  and measure still for measure 
then  angelo  thy fault thus manifested 
which  though thou wouldst deny  denies thee vantage 
we do condemn thee to the very block
where claudio stoop to death  and with like haste 
away with him 


mariana

                  o my most gracious lord 
i hope you will not mock me with a husband 


duke vincentio

it is your husband mock you with a husband 
consenting to the safeguard of your honour 
i thought your marriage fit  else imputation 
for that he knew you  might reproach your life
and choke your good to come  for his possessions 
although by confiscation they are ours 
we do instate and widow you withal 
to buy you a better husband 


mariana

o my dear lord 
i crave no other  nor no better man 


duke vincentio

never crave him  we are definitive 


mariana

gentle my liege 
kneeling


duke vincentio

                  you do but lose your labour 
away with him to death 
to lucio
now  sir  to you 


mariana

o my good lord  sweet isabel  take my part 
lend me your knees  and all my life to come
i lend you all my life to do you service 


duke vincentio

against all sense you do importune her 
should she kneel down in mercy of this fact 
her brother ghost his paved bed would break 
and take her hence in horror 


mariana

isabel 
sweet isabel  do yet but kneel by me 
hold up your hands  say nothing  i speak all 
they say  best men are moulded out of faults 
and  for the most  become much more the better
for being a little bad  so may my husband 
o isabel  will you not lend a knee 


duke vincentio

he dies for claudio death 


isabella

most bounteous sir 
kneeling
look  if it please you  on this man condemn d 
as if my brother lived  i partly think
a due sincerity govern his deeds 
till he did look on me  since it is so 
let him not die  my brother had but justice 
in that he did the thing for which he died 
for angelo 
his act did not o his bad intent 
and must be buried but as an intent
that perish by the way  thoughts are no subjects 
intents but merely thoughts 


mariana

merely  my lord 


duke vincentio

your suit unprofitable  stand up  i say 
i have bethought me of another fault 
provost  how came it claudio was beheaded
at an unusual hour 


provost

it was commanded so 


duke vincentio

had you a special warrant for the deed 


provost

no  my good lord  it was by private message 


duke vincentio

for which i do discharge you of your office 
give up your keys 


provost

                  pardon me  noble lord 
i thought it was a fault  but knew it not 
yet did repent me  after more advice 
for testimony whereof  one in the prison 
that should by private order else have died 
i have reserved alive 


duke vincentio

what he 


provost

his name is barnardine 


duke vincentio

i would thou hadst done so by claudio 
go fetch him hither  let me look upon him 
exit provost


escalus

i am sorry  one so learned and so wise
as you  lord angelo  have still appear d 
should slip so grossly  both in the heat of blood 
and lack of temper judgment afterward 


angelo

i am sorry that such sorrow i procure 
and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
that i crave death more willingly than mercy 
 my deserving  and i do entreat it 
re enter provost  with barnardine  claudio muffled  and juliet


duke vincentio

which is that barnardine
