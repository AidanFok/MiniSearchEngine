scene iii  warkworth  before the castle 


enter northumberland  lady northumberland  and lady percy


northumberland

i pray thee  loving wife  and gentle daughter 
give even way unto my rough affairs 
put not you on the visage of the times
and be like them to percy troublesome 
lady


northumberland

i have given over  i will speak no more 
do what you will  your wisdom be your guide 


northumberland

alas  sweet wife  my honour is at pawn 
and  but my going  nothing can redeem it 


lady percy

o yet  for god sake  go not to these wars 
the time was  father  that you broke your word 
when you were more endeared to it than now 
when your own percy  when my heart dear harry 
threw many a northward look to see his father
bring up his powers  but he did long in vain 
who then persuaded you to stay at home 
there were two honours lost  yours and your son s 
for yours  the god of heaven brighten it 
for his  it stuck upon him as the sun
in the grey vault of heaven  and by his light
did all the chivalry of england move
to do brave acts  he was indeed the glass
wherein the noble youth did dress themselves 
he had no legs that practised not his gait 
and speaking thick  which nature made his blemish 
became the accents of the valiant 
for those that could speak low and tardily
would turn their own perfection to abuse 
to seem like him  so that in speech  in gait 
in diet  in affections of delight 
in military rules  humours of blood 
he was the mark and glass  copy and book 
that fashion others  and him  o wondrous him 
o miracle of men  him did you leave 
second to none  unseconded by you 
to look upon the hideous god of war
in disadvantage  to abide a field
where nothing but the sound of hotspur name
did seem defensible  so you left him 
never  o never  do his ghost the wrong
to hold your honour more precise and nice
with others than with him  let them alone 
the marshal and the archbishop are strong 
had my sweet harry had but half their numbers 
to day might i  hanging on hotspur neck 
have talk of monmouth grave 


northumberland

beshrew your heart 
fair daughter  you do draw my spirits from me
with new lamenting ancient oversights 
but i must go and meet with danger there 
or it will seek me in another place
and find me worse provided 
lady


northumberland

o  fly to scotland 
till that the nobles and the armed commons
have of their puissance made a little taste 


lady percy

if they get ground and vantage of the king 
then join you with them  like a rib of steel 
to make strength stronger  but  for all our loves 
first let them try themselves  so did your son 
he was so suffer d  so came i a widow 
and never shall have length of life enough
to rain upon remembrance with mine eyes 
that it may grow and sprout as high as heaven 
for recordation to my noble husband 


northumberland

come  come  go in with me   with my mind
as with the tide swell up unto his height 
that makes a still stand  running neither way 
fain would i go to meet the archbishop 
but many thousand reasons hold me back 
i will resolve for scotland  there am i 
till time and vantage crave my company 
exeunt
