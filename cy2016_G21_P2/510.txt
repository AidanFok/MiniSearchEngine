scene i  venice  a street 


enter antonio  salarino  and salanio


antonio

in sooth  i know not why i am so sad 
it wearies me  you say it wearies you 
but how i caught it  found it  or came by it 
what stuff  made of  whereof it is born 
i am to learn 
and such a want wit sadness makes of me 
that i have much ado to know myself 


salarino

your mind is tossing on the ocean 
there  where your argosies with portly sail 
like signiors and rich burghers on the flood 
or  as it were  the pageants of the sea 
do overpeer the petty traffickers 
that curtsy to them  do them reverence 
as they fly by them with their woven wings 


salanio

believe me  sir  had i such venture forth 
the better part of my affections would
be with my hopes abroad  i should be still
plucking the grass  to know where sits the wind 
peering in maps for ports and piers and roads 
and every object that might make me fear
misfortune to my ventures  out of doubt
would make me sad 


salarino

                  my wind cooling my broth
would blow me to an ague  when i thought
what harm a wind too great at sea might do 
i should not see the sandy hour glass run 
but i should think of shallows and of flats 
and see my wealthy andrew dock in sand 
vailing her high top lower than her ribs
to kiss her burial  should i go to church
and see the holy edifice of stone 
and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks 
which touching but my gentle vessel side 
would scatter all her spices on the stream 
enrobe the roaring waters with my silks 
and  in a word  but even now worth this 
and now worth nothing  shall i have the thought
to think on this  and shall i lack the thought
that such a thing bechanced would make me sad 
but tell not me  i know  antonio
is sad to think upon his merchandise 


antonio

believe me  no  i thank my fortune for it 
my ventures are not in one bottom trusted 
nor to one place  nor is my whole estate
upon the fortune of this present year 
therefore my merchandise makes me not sad 


salarino

why  then you are in love 


antonio

fie  fie 


salarino

not in love neither  then let us say you are sad 
because you are not merry  and  as easy
for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry 
because you are not sad  now  by two headed janus 
nature hath framed strange fellows in her time 
some that will evermore peep through their eyes
and laugh like parrots at a bag piper 
and other of such vinegar aspect
that they not show their teeth in way of smile 
though nestor swear the jest be laughable 
enter bassanio  lorenzo  and gratiano


salanio

here comes bassanio  your most noble kinsman 
gratiano and lorenzo  fare ye well 
we leave you now with better company 


salarino

i would have stay till i had made you merry 
if worthier friends had not prevented me 


antonio

your worth is very dear in my regard 
i take it  your own business calls on you
and you embrace the occasion to depart 


salarino

good morrow  my good lords 


bassanio

good signiors both  when shall we laugh  say  when 
you grow exceeding strange  must it be so 


salarino

we make our leisures to attend on yours 
exeunt salarino and salanio


lorenzo

my lord bassanio  since you have found antonio 
we two will leave you  but at dinner time 
i pray you  have in mind where we must meet 


bassanio

i will not fail you 


gratiano

you look not well  signior antonio 
you have too much respect upon the world 
they lose it that do buy it with much care 
believe me  you are marvellously changed 


antonio

i hold the world but as the world  gratiano 
a stage where every man must play a part 
and mine a sad one 


gratiano

let me play the fool 
with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come 
and let my liver rather heat with wine
than my heart cool with mortifying groans 
why should a man  whose blood is warm within 
sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster 
sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
by being peevish  i tell thee what  antonio 
i love thee  and it is my love that speaks 
there are a sort of men whose visages
do cream and mantle like a standing pond 
and do a wilful stillness entertain 
with purpose to be dress in an opinion
of wisdom  gravity  profound conceit 
as who should say  am sir oracle 
and when i ope my lips let no dog bark 
o my antonio  i do know of these
that therefore only are reputed wise
for saying nothing  when  i am very sure 
if they should speak  would almost damn those ears 
which  hearing them  would call their brothers fools 
i tell thee more of this another time 
but fish not  with this melancholy bait 
for this fool gudgeon  this opinion 
come  good lorenzo  fare ye well awhile 
i end my exhortation after dinner 


lorenzo

well  we will leave you then till dinner time 
i must be one of these same dumb wise men 
for gratiano never lets me speak 


gratiano

well  keep me company but two years moe 
thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue 


antonio

farewell  i grow a talker for this gear 


gratiano

thanks  i  faith  for silence is only commendable
in a neat tongue dried and a maid not vendible 
exeunt gratiano and lorenzo


antonio

is that any thing now 


bassanio

gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing  more
than any man in all venice  his reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff  you
shall seek all day ere you find them  and when you
have them  they are not worth the search 


antonio

well  tell me now what lady is the same
to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage 
that you to day promised to tell me of 


bassanio

 not unknown to you  antonio 
how much i have disabled mine estate 
by something showing a more swelling port
than my faint means would grant continuance 
nor do i now make moan to be abridged
from such a noble rate  but my chief care
is to come fairly off from the great debts
wherein my time something too prodigal
hath left me gaged  to you  antonio 
i owe the most  in money and in love 
and from your love i have a warranty
to unburden all my plots and purposes
how to get clear of all the debts i owe 


antonio

i pray you  good bassanio  let me know it 
and if it stand  as you yourself still do 
within the eye of honour  be assured 
my purse  my person  my extremest means 
lie all unlock to your occasions 


bassanio

in my school days  when i had lost one shaft 
i shot his fellow of the self same flight
the self same way with more advised watch 
to find the other forth  and by adventuring both
i oft found both  i urge this childhood proof 
because what follows is pure innocence 
i owe you much  and  like a wilful youth 
that which i owe is lost  but if you please
to shoot another arrow that self way
which you did shoot the first  i do not doubt 
as i will watch the aim  or to find both
or bring your latter hazard back again
and thankfully rest debtor for the first 


antonio

you know me well  and herein spend but time
to wind about my love with circumstance 
and out of doubt you do me now more wrong
in making question of my uttermost
than if you had made waste of all i have 
then do but say to me what i should do
that in your knowledge may by me be done 
and i am prest unto it  therefore  speak 


bassanio

in belmont is a lady richly left 
and she is fair  and  fairer than that word 
of wondrous virtues  sometimes from her eyes
i did receive fair speechless messages 
her name is portia  nothing undervalued
to cato daughter  brutus  portia 
nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth 
for the four winds blow in from every coast
renowned suitors  and her sunny locks
hang on her temples like a golden fleece 
which makes her seat of belmont colchos  strand 
and many jasons come in quest of her 
o my antonio  had i but the means
to hold a rival place with one of them 
i have a mind presages me such thrift 
that i should questionless be fortunate 


antonio

thou know that all my fortunes are at sea 
neither have i money nor commodity
to raise a present sum  therefore go forth 
try what my credit can in venice do 
that shall be rack d  even to the uttermost 
to furnish thee to belmont  to fair portia 
go  presently inquire  and so will i 
where money is  and i no question make
to have it of my trust or for my sake 
exeunt
