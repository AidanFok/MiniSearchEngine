scene ii  belmont  a room in portia house 
enter portia and nerissa


portia

by my troth  nerissa  my little body is aweary of
this great world 


nerissa

you would be  sweet madam  if your miseries were in
the same abundance as your good fortunes are  and
yet  for aught i see  they are as sick that surfeit
with too much as they that starve with nothing  it
is no mean happiness therefore  to be seated in the
mean  superfluity comes sooner by white hairs  but
competency lives longer 


portia

good sentences and well pronounced 


nerissa

they would be better  if well followed 


portia

if to do were as easy as to know what were good to
do  chapels had been churches and poor men 
cottages princes  palaces  it is a good divine that
follows his own instructions  i can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done  than be one of the
twenty to follow mine own teaching  the brain may
devise laws for the blood  but a hot temper leaps
o a cold decree  such a hare is madness the
youth  to skip o the meshes of good counsel the
cripple  but this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband  o me  the word  choose  i may
neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i
dislike  so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father  is it not hard 
nerissa  that i cannot choose one nor refuse none 


nerissa

your father was ever virtuous  and holy men at their
death have good inspirations  therefore the lottery 
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold 
silver and lead  whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you  will  no doubt  never be chosen by any
rightly but one who shall rightly love  but what
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
these princely suitors that are already come 


portia

i pray thee  over name them  and as thou namest
them  i will describe them  and  according to my
description  level at my affection 


nerissa

first  there is the neapolitan prince 


portia

ay  that a colt indeed  for he doth nothing but
talk of his horse  and he makes it a great
appropriation to his own good parts  that he can
shoe him himself  i am much afeard my lady his
mother played false with a smith 


nerissa

then there is the county palatine 


portia

he doth nothing but frown  as who should say  you
will not have me  choose  he hears merry tales and
smiles not  i fear he will prove the weeping
philosopher when he grows old  being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth  i had rather be
married to a death s head with a bone in his mouth
than to either of these  god defend me from these
two 


nerissa

how say you by the french lord  monsieur le bon 


portia

god made him  and therefore let him pass for a man 
in truth  i know it is a sin to be a mocker  but 
he  why  he hath a horse better than the
neapolitan s  a better bad habit of frowning than
the count palatine  he is every man in no man  if a
throstle sing  he falls straight a capering  he will
fence with his own shadow  if i should marry him  i
should marry twenty husbands  if he would despise me
i would forgive him  for if he love me to madness  i
shall never requite him 


nerissa

what say you  then  to falconbridge  the young baron
of england 


portia

you know i say nothing to him  for he understands
not me  nor i him  he hath neither latin  french 
nor italian  and you will come into the court and
swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english 
he is a proper man picture  but  alas  who can
converse with a dumb show  how oddly he is suited 
i think he bought his doublet in italy  his round
hose in france  his bonnet in germany and his
behavior every where 


nerissa

what think you of the scottish lord  his neighbour 


portia

that he hath a neighbourly charity in him  for he
borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and
swore he would pay him again when he was able  i
think the frenchman became his surety and sealed
under for another 


nerissa

how like you the young german  the duke of saxony nephew 


portia

very vilely in the morning  when he is sober  and
most vilely in the afternoon  when he is drunk  when
he is best  he is a little worse than a man  and
when he is worst  he is little better than a beast 
and the worst fall that ever fell  i hope i shall
make shift to go without him 


nerissa

if he should offer to choose  and choose the right
casket  you should refuse to perform your father 
will  if you should refuse to accept him 


portia

therefore  for fear of the worst  i pray thee  set a
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket 
for if the devil be within and that temptation
without  i know he will choose it  i will do any
thing  nerissa  ere i be married to a sponge 


nerissa

you need not fear  lady  the having any of these
lords  they have acquainted me with their
determinations  which is  indeed  to return to their
home and to trouble you with no more suit  unless
you may be won by some other sort than your father 
imposition depending on the caskets 


portia

if i live to be as old as sibylla  i will die as
chaste as diana  unless i be obtained by the manner
of my father will  i am glad this parcel of wooers
are so reasonable  for there is not one among them
but i dote on his very absence  and i pray god grant
them a fair departure 


nerissa

do you not remember  lady  in your father time  a
venetian  a scholar and a soldier  that came hither
in company of the marquis of montferrat 


portia

yes  yes  it was bassanio  as i think  he was so called 


nerissa

true  madam  he  of all the men that ever my foolish
eyes looked upon  was the best deserving a fair lady 


portia

i remember him well  and i remember him worthy of
thy praise 
enter a serving man
how now  what news 


servant

the four strangers seek for you  madam  to take
their leave  and there is a forerunner come from a
fifth  the prince of morocco  who brings word the
prince his master will be here to night 


portia

if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
heart as i can bid the other four farewell  i should
be glad of his approach  if he have the condition
of a saint and the complexion of a devil  i had
rather he should shrive me than wive me  come 
nerissa  sirrah  go before 
whiles we shut the gates
upon one wooer  another knocks at the door 
exeunt
