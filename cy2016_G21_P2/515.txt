enter jessica and launcelot


jessica

i am sorry thou wilt leave my father so 
our house is hell  and thou  a merry devil 
didst rob it of some taste of tediousness 
but fare thee well  there is a ducat for thee 
and  launcelot  soon at supper shalt thou see
lorenzo  who is thy new master guest 
give him this letter  do it secretly 
and so farewell  i would not have my father
see me in talk with thee 


launcelot

adieu  tears exhibit my tongue  most beautiful
pagan  most sweet jew  if a christian did not play
the knave and get thee  i am much deceived  but 
adieu  these foolish drops do something drown my
manly spirit  adieu 


jessica

farewell  good launcelot 
exit launcelot
alack  what heinous sin is it in me
to be ashamed to be my father child 
but though i am a daughter to his blood 
i am not to his manners  o lorenzo 
if thou keep promise  i shall end this strife 
become a christian and thy loving wife 
exit
