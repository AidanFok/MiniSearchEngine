scene v  the same  before shylock house 


enter shylock and launcelot


shylock

well  thou shalt see  thy eyes shall be thy judge 
the difference of old shylock and bassanio 
what  jessica thou shalt not gormandise 
as thou hast done with me what  jessica 
and sleep and snore  and rend apparel out 
why  jessica  i say 


launcelot

why  jessica 


shylock

who bids thee call  i do not bid thee call 


launcelot

your worship was wont to tell me that
i could do nothing without bidding 
enter jessica


jessica

call you  what is your will 


shylock

i am bid forth to supper  jessica 
there are my keys  but wherefore should i go 
i am not bid for love  they flatter me 
but yet i go in hate  to feed upon
the prodigal christian  jessica  my girl 
look to my house  i am right loath to go 
there is some ill a brewing towards my rest 
for i did dream of money bags to night 


launcelot

i beseech you  sir  go  my young master doth expect
your reproach 


shylock

so do i his 


launcelot

an they have conspired together  i will not say you
shall see a masque  but if you do  then it was not
for nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on
black monday last at six o i  the morning 
falling out that year on ash wednesday was four
year  in the afternoon 


shylock

what  are there masques  hear you me  jessica 
lock up my doors  and when you hear the drum
and the vile squealing of the wry neck fife 
clamber not you up to the casements then 
nor thrust your head into the public street
to gaze on christian fools with varnish faces 
but stop my house ears  i mean my casements 
let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
my sober house  by jacob staff  i swear 
i have no mind of feasting forth to night 
but i will go  go you before me  sirrah 
say i will come 


launcelot

i will go before  sir  mistress  look out at
window  for all this  there will come a christian
boy  will be worth a jewess  eye 
exit


shylock

what says that fool of hagar offspring  ha 


jessica

his words were  mistress  nothing else 


shylock

the patch is kind enough  but a huge feeder 
snail slow in profit  and he sleeps by day
more than the wild cat  drones hive not with me 
therefore i part with him  and part with him
to one that would have him help to waste
his borrow purse  well  jessica  go in 
perhaps i will return immediately 
do as i bid you  shut doors after you 
fast bind  fast find 
a proverb never stale in thrifty mind 
exit


jessica

farewell  and if my fortune be not crost 
i have a father  you a daughter  lost 
exit
