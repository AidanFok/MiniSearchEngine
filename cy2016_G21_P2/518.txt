enter gratiano and salarino  masqued


gratiano

this is the pent house under which lorenzo
desired us to make stand 


salarino

his hour is almost past 


gratiano

and it is marvel he out dwells his hour 
for lovers ever run before the clock 


salarino

o  ten times faster venus  pigeons fly
to seal love bonds new made  than they are wont
to keep obliged faith unforfeited 


gratiano

that ever holds  who riseth from a feast
with that keen appetite that he sits down 
where is the horse that doth untread again
his tedious measures with the unbated fire
that he did pace them first  all things that are 
are with more spirit chased than enjoy d 
how like a younker or a prodigal
the scarfed bark puts from her native bay 
hugg and embraced by the strumpet wind 
how like the prodigal doth she return 
with over weather ribs and ragged sails 
lean  rent and beggar by the strumpet wind 


salarino

here comes lorenzo  more of this hereafter 
enter lorenzo


lorenzo

sweet friends  your patience for my long abode 
not i  but my affairs  have made you wait 
when you shall please to play the thieves for wives 
i watch as long for you then  approach 
here dwells my father jew  ho  who within 
enter jessica  above  in boy clothes


jessica

who are you  tell me  for more certainty 
albeit i swear that i do know your tongue 


lorenzo

lorenzo  and thy love 


jessica

lorenzo  certain  and my love indeed 
for who love i so much  and now who knows
but you  lorenzo  whether i am yours 


lorenzo

heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art 


jessica

here  catch this casket  it is worth the pains 
i am glad  night  you do not look on me 
for i am much ashamed of my exchange 
but love is blind and lovers cannot see
the pretty follies that themselves commit 
for if they could  cupid himself would blush
to see me thus transformed to a boy 


lorenzo

descend  for you must be my torchbearer 


jessica

what  must i hold a candle to my shames 
they in themselves  good sooth  are too too light 
why   an office of discovery  love 
and i should be obscured 


lorenzo

so are you  sweet 
even in the lovely garnish of a boy 
but come at once 
for the close night doth play the runaway 
and we are stay for at bassanio feast 


jessica

i will make fast the doors  and gild myself
with some more ducats  and be with you straight 
exit above


gratiano

now  by my hood  a gentile and no jew 


lorenzo

beshrew me but i love her heartily 
for she is wise  if i can judge of her 
and fair she is  if that mine eyes be true 
and true she is  as she hath proved herself 
and therefore  like herself  wise  fair and true 
shall she be placed in my constant soul 
enter jessica  below
what  art thou come  on  gentlemen  away 
our masquing mates by this time for us stay 
exit with jessica and salarino

no masque to night  the wind is come about 
bassanio presently will go aboard 
i have sent twenty out to seek for you 


gratiano

i am glad on t  i desire no more delight
than to be under sail and gone to night
