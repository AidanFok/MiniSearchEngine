scene vii  belmont  a room in portia house 


flourish of cornets  enter portia  with the prince of morocco  and their trains


portia

go draw aside the curtains and discover
the several caskets to this noble prince 
now make your choice 


morocco

the first  of gold  who this inscription bears 
 chooseth me shall gain what many men desire 
the second  silver  which this promise carries 
 chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves 
this third  dull lead  with warning all as blunt 
 chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath 
how shall i know if i do choose the right 


portia

the one of them contains my picture  prince 
if you choose that  then i am yours withal 


morocco

some god direct my judgment  let me see 
i will survey the inscriptions back again 
what says this leaden casket 
 chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath 
must give  for what  for lead  hazard for lead 
this casket threatens  men that hazard all
do it in hope of fair advantages 
a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross 
i then nor give nor hazard aught for lead 
what says the silver with her virgin hue 
 chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves 
as much as he deserves  pause there  morocco 
and weigh thy value with an even hand 
if thou be rated by thy estimation 
thou dost deserve enough  and yet enough
may not extend so far as to the lady 
and yet to be afeard of my deserving
were but a weak disabling of myself 
as much as i deserve  why  that the lady 
i do in birth deserve her  and in fortunes 
in graces and in qualities of breeding 
but more than these  in love i do deserve 
what if i stray no further  but chose here 
let see once more this saying graved in gold
 chooseth me shall gain what many men desire 
why  that the lady  all the world desires her 
from the four corners of the earth they come 
to kiss this shrine  this mortal breathing saint 
the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
of wide arabia are as thoroughfares now
for princes to come view fair portia 
the watery kingdom  whose ambitious head
spits in the face of heaven  is no bar
to stop the foreign spirits  but they come 
as o a brook  to see fair portia 
one of these three contains her heavenly picture 
is like that lead contains her   damnation
to think so base a thought  it were too gross
to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave 
or shall i think in silver she immured 
being ten times undervalued to tried gold 
o sinful thought  never so rich a gem
was set in worse than gold  they have in england
a coin that bears the figure of an angel
stamped in gold  but that insculp upon 
but here an angel in a golden bed
lies all within  deliver me the key 
here do i choose  and thrive i as i may 


portia

there  take it  prince  and if my form lie there 
then i am yours 
he unlocks the golden casket


morocco

                  o hell  what have we here 
a carrion death  within whose empty eye
there is a written scroll  i read the writing 
reads
all that glitters is not gold 
often have you heard that told 
many a man his life hath sold
but my outside to behold 
gilded tombs do worms enfold 
had you been as wise as bold 
young in limbs  in judgment old 
your answer had not been inscroll d 
fare you well  your suit is cold 
cold  indeed  and labour lost 
then  farewell  heat  and welcome  frost 
portia  adieu  i have too grieved a heart
to take a tedious leave  thus losers part 
exit with his train  flourish of cornets


portia

a gentle riddance  draw the curtains  go 
let all of his complexion choose me so 
exeunt
