scene viii  venice  a street 


enter salarino and salanio


salarino

why  man  i saw bassanio under sail 
with him is gratiano gone along 
and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not 


salanio

the villain jew with outcries raised the duke 
who went with him to search bassanio ship 


salarino

he came too late  the ship was under sail 
but there the duke was given to understand
that in a gondola were seen together
lorenzo and his amorous jessica 
besides  antonio certified the duke
they were not with bassanio in his ship 


salanio

i never heard a passion so confused 
so strange  outrageous  and so variable 
as the dog jew did utter in the streets 
 daughter  o my ducats  o my daughter 
fled with a christian  o my christian ducats 
justice  the law  my ducats  and my daughter 
a sealed bag  two sealed bags of ducats 
of double ducats  stolen from me by my daughter 
and jewels  two stones  two rich and precious stones 
stolen by my daughter  justice  find the girl 
she hath the stones upon her  and the ducats 


salarino

why  all the boys in venice follow him 
crying  his stones  his daughter  and his ducats 


salanio

let good antonio look he keep his day 
or he shall pay for this 


salarino

marry  well remember d 
i reason with a frenchman yesterday 
who told me  in the narrow seas that part
the french and english  there miscarried
a vessel of our country richly fraught 
i thought upon antonio when he told me 
and wish in silence that it were not his 


salanio

you were best to tell antonio what you hear 
yet do not suddenly  for it may grieve him 


salarino

a kinder gentleman treads not the earth 
i saw bassanio and antonio part 
bassanio told him he would make some speed
of his return  he answer d   not so 
slubber not business for my sake  bassanio
but stay the very riping of the time 
and for the jew bond which he hath of me 
let it not enter in your mind of love 
be merry  and employ your chiefest thoughts
to courtship and such fair ostents of love
as shall conveniently become you there 
and even there  his eye being big with tears 
turning his face  he put his hand behind him 
and with affection wondrous sensible
he wrung bassanio hand  and so they parted 


salanio

i think he only loves the world for him 
i pray thee  let us go and find him out
and quicken his embraced heaviness
with some delight or other 


salarino

do we so 
exeunt
