scene ix  belmont  a room in portia house 


enter nerissa with a servitor


nerissa

quick  quick  i pray thee  draw the curtain straight 
the prince of arragon hath ta his oath 
and comes to his election presently 
flourish of cornets  enter the prince of arragon  portia  and their trains


portia

behold  there stand the caskets  noble prince 
if you choose that wherein i am contain d 
straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized 
but if you fail  without more speech  my lord 
you must be gone from hence immediately 


arragon

i am enjoin by oath to observe three things 
first  never to unfold to any one
which casket  i chose  next  if i fail
of the right casket  never in my life
to woo a maid in way of marriage  lastly 
if i do fail in fortune of my choice 
immediately to leave you and be gone 


portia

to these injunctions every one doth swear
that comes to hazard for my worthless self 


arragon

and so have i address me  fortune now
to my heart hope  gold  silver  and base lead 
 chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath 
you shall look fairer  ere i give or hazard 
what says the golden chest  ha  let me see 
 chooseth me shall gain what many men desire 
what many men desire  that  many  may be meant
by the fool multitude  that choose by show 
not learning more than the fond eye doth teach 
which pries not to the interior  but  like the martlet 
builds in the weather on the outward wall 
even in the force and road of casualty 
i will not choose what many men desire 
because i will not jump with common spirits
and rank me with the barbarous multitudes 
why  then to thee  thou silver treasure house 
tell me once more what title thou dost bear 
 chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves 
and well said too  for who shall go about
to cozen fortune and be honourable
without the stamp of merit  let none presume
to wear an undeserved dignity 
o  that estates  degrees and offices
were not derived corruptly  and that clear honour
were purchased by the merit of the wearer 
how many then should cover that stand bare 
how many be commanded that command 
how much low peasantry would then be glean 
from the true seed of honour  and how much honour
pick from the chaff and ruin of the times
to be new varnish d  well  but to my choice 
 chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves 
i will assume desert  give me a key for this 
and instantly unlock my fortunes here 
he opens the silver casket


portia

too long a pause for that which you find there 


arragon

what here  the portrait of a blinking idiot 
presenting me a schedule  i will read it 
how much unlike art thou to portia 
how much unlike my hopes and my deservings 
 chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves 
did i deserve no more than a fool head 
is that my prize  are my deserts no better 


portia

to offend  and judge  are distinct offices
and of opposed natures 


arragon

what is here 
reads
the fire seven times tried this 
seven times tried that judgment is 
that did never choose amiss 
some there be that shadows kiss 
such have but a shadow bliss 
there be fools alive  i wis 
silver o er  and so was this 
take what wife you will to bed 
i will ever be your head 
so be gone  you are sped 
still more fool i shall appear
by the time i linger here
with one fool head i came to woo 
but i go away with two 
sweet  adieu  i keep my oath 
patiently to bear my wroth 
exeunt arragon and train


portia

thus hath the candle singed the moth 
o  these deliberate fools  when they do choose 
they have the wisdom by their wit to lose 


nerissa

the ancient saying is no heresy 
hanging and wiving goes by destiny 


portia

come  draw the curtain  nerissa 
enter a servant


servant

where is my lady 


portia

                  here  what would my lord 


servant

madam  there is alighted at your gate
a young venetian  one that comes before
to signify the approaching of his lord 
from whom he bringeth sensible regreets 
to wit  besides commends and courteous breath 
gifts of rich value  yet i have not seen
so likely an ambassador of love 
a day in april never came so sweet 
to show how costly summer was at hand 
as this fore spurrer comes before his lord 


portia

no more  i pray thee  i am half afeard
thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee 
thou spend such high day wit in praising him 
come  come  nerissa  for i long to see
quick cupid post that comes so mannerly 


nerissa

bassanio  lord love  if thy will it be 
exeunt
