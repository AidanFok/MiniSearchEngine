scene iii  venice  a street 


enter shylock  salarino  antonio  and gaoler


shylock

gaoler  look to him  tell not me of mercy 
this is the fool that lent out money gratis 
gaoler  look to him 


antonio

hear me yet  good shylock 


shylock

i have my bond  speak not against my bond 
i have sworn an oath that i will have my bond 
thou call me dog before thou hadst a cause 
but  since i am a dog  beware my fangs 
the duke shall grant me justice  i do wonder 
thou naughty gaoler  that thou art so fond
to come abroad with him at his request 


antonio

i pray thee  hear me speak 


shylock

i have my bond  i will not hear thee speak 
i have my bond  and therefore speak no more 
i not be made a soft and dull eyed fool 
to shake the head  relent  and sigh  and yield
to christian intercessors  follow not 
i have no speaking  i will have my bond 
exit


salarino

it is the most impenetrable cur
that ever kept with men 


antonio

let him alone 
i follow him no more with bootless prayers 
he seeks my life  his reason well i know 
i oft deliver from his forfeitures
many that have at times made moan to me 
therefore he hates me 


salarino

i am sure the duke
will never grant this forfeiture to hold 


antonio

the duke cannot deny the course of law 
for the commodity that strangers have
with us in venice  if it be denied 
will much impeach the justice of his state 
since that the trade and profit of the city
consisteth of all nations  therefore  go 
these griefs and losses have so bated me 
that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
to morrow to my bloody creditor 
well  gaoler  on  pray god  bassanio come
to see me pay his debt  and then i care not 
exeunt
