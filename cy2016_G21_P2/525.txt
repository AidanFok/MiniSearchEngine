scene iv  belmont  a room in portia house 


enter portia  nerissa  lorenzo  jessica  and balthasar


lorenzo

madam  although i speak it in your presence 
you have a noble and a true conceit
of godlike amity  which appears most strongly
in bearing thus the absence of your lord 
but if you  knew to whom you show this honour 
how true a gentleman you send relief 
how dear a lover of my lord your husband 
i know you would be prouder of the work
than customary bounty can enforce you 


portia

i never did repent for doing good 
nor shall not now  for in companions
that do converse and waste the time together 
whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love 
there must be needs a like proportion
of lineaments  of manners and of spirit 
which makes me think that this antonio 
being the bosom lover of my lord 
must needs be like my lord  if it be so 
how little is the cost i have bestow 
in purchasing the semblance of my soul
from out the state of hellish misery 
this comes too near the praising of myself 
therefore no more of it  hear other things 
lorenzo  i commit into your hands
the husbandry and manage of my house
until my lord return  for mine own part 
i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
to live in prayer and contemplation 
only attended by nerissa here 
until her husband and my lord return 
there is a monastery two miles off 
and there will we abide  i do desire you
not to deny this imposition 
the which my love and some necessity
now lays upon you 


lorenzo

                  madam  with all my heart 
i shall obey you in all fair commands 


portia

my people do already know my mind 
and will acknowledge you and jessica
in place of lord bassanio and myself 
and so farewell  till we shall meet again 


lorenzo

fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you 


jessica

i wish your ladyship all heart content 


portia

i thank you for your wish  and am well pleased
to wish it back on you  fare you well jessica 
exeunt jessica and lorenzo
now  balthasar 
as i have ever found thee honest true 
so let me find thee still  take this same letter 
and use thou all the endeavour of a man
in speed to padua  see thou render this
into my cousin hand  doctor bellario 
and  look  what notes and garments he doth give thee 
bring them  i pray thee  with imagined speed
unto the tranect  to the common ferry
which trades to venice  waste no time in words 
but get thee gone  i shall be there before thee 


balthasar

madam  i go with all convenient speed 
exit


portia

come on  nerissa  i have work in hand
that you yet know not of  we see our husbands
before they think of us 


nerissa

shall they see us 


portia

they shall  nerissa  but in such a habit 
that they shall think we are accomplished
with that we lack  i hold thee any wager 
when we are both accoutred like young men 
i prove the prettier fellow of the two 
and wear my dagger with the braver grace 
and speak between the change of man and boy
with a reed voice  and turn two mincing steps
into a manly stride  and speak of frays
like a fine bragging youth  and tell quaint lies 
how honourable ladies sought my love 
which i denying  they fell sick and died 
i could not do withal  then i repent 
and wish for all that  that i had not killed them 
and twenty of these puny lies i tell 
that men shall swear i have discontinued school
above a twelvemonth  i have within my mind
a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks 
which i will practise 


nerissa

why  shall we turn to men 


portia

fie  what a question that 
if thou wert near a lewd interpreter 
but come  i tell thee all my whole device
when i am in my coach  which stays for us
at the park gate  and therefore haste away 
for we must measure twenty miles to day
