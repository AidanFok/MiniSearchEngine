enter lorenzo and jessica


lorenzo

the moon shines bright  in such a night as this 
when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
and they did make no noise  in such a night
troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls
and sigh his soul toward the grecian tents 
where cressid lay that night 


jessica

in such a night
did thisbe fearfully o the dew
and saw the lion shadow ere himself
and ran dismay away 


lorenzo

in such a night
stood dido with a willow in her hand
upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
to come again to carthage 


jessica

in such a night
medea gather the enchanted herbs
that did renew old aeson 


lorenzo

in such a night
did jessica steal from the wealthy jew
and with an unthrift love did run from venice
as far as belmont 


jessica

                  in such a night
did young lorenzo swear he loved her well 
stealing her soul with many vows of faith
and ne a true one 


lorenzo

in such a night
did pretty jessica  like a little shrew 
slander her love  and he forgave it her 


jessica

i would out night you  did no body come 
but  hark  i hear the footing of a man 
enter stephano


lorenzo

who comes so fast in silence of the night 


stephano

a friend 


lorenzo

a friend  what friend  your name  i pray you  friend 


stephano

stephano is my name  and i bring word
my mistress will before the break of day
be here at belmont  she doth stray about
by holy crosses  where she kneels and prays
for happy wedlock hours 


lorenzo

who comes with her 


stephano

none but a holy hermit and her maid 
i pray you  is my master yet return d 


lorenzo

he is not  nor we have not heard from him 
but go we in  i pray thee  jessica 
and ceremoniously let us prepare
some welcome for the mistress of the house 
enter launcelot


launcelot

sola  sola  wo ha  ho  sola  sola 


lorenzo

who calls 


launcelot

sola  did you see master lorenzo 
master lorenzo  sola  sola 


lorenzo

leave hollaing  man  here 


launcelot

sola  where  where 


lorenzo

here 


launcelot

tell him there a post come from my master  with
his horn full of good news  my master will be here
ere morning 
exit


lorenzo

sweet soul  let in  and there expect their coming 
and yet no matter  why should we go in 
my friend stephano  signify  i pray you 
within the house  your mistress is at hand 
and bring your music forth into the air 
exit stephano
how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank 
here will we sit and let the sounds of music
creep in our ears  soft stillness and the night
become the touches of sweet harmony 
sit  jessica  look how the floor of heaven
is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold 
there not the smallest orb which thou behold 
but in his motion like an angel sings 
still quiring to the young eyed cherubins 
such harmony is in immortal souls 
but whilst this muddy vesture of decay
doth grossly close it in  we cannot hear it 
enter musicians
come  ho  and wake diana with a hymn 
with sweetest touches pierce your mistress  ear 
and draw her home with music 
music


jessica

i am never merry when i hear sweet music 


lorenzo

the reason is  your spirits are attentive 
for do but note a wild and wanton herd 
or race of youthful and unhandled colts 
fetching mad bounds  bellowing and neighing loud 
which is the hot condition of their blood 
if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound 
or any air of music touch their ears 
you shall perceive them make a mutual stand 
their savage eyes turn to a modest gaze
by the sweet power of music  therefore the poet
did feign that orpheus drew trees  stones and floods 
since nought so stockish  hard and full of rage 
but music for the time doth change his nature 
the man that hath no music in himself 
nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds 
is fit for treasons  stratagems and spoils 
the motions of his spirit are dull as night
and his affections dark as erebus 
let no such man be trusted  mark the music 
enter portia and nerissa


portia

that light we see is burning in my hall 
how far that little candle throws his beams 
so shines a good deed in a naughty world 


nerissa

when the moon shone  we did not see the candle 


portia

so doth the greater glory dim the less 
a substitute shines brightly as a king
unto the king be by  and then his state
empties itself  as doth an inland brook
into the main of waters  music  hark 


nerissa

it is your music  madam  of the house 


portia

nothing is good  i see  without respect 
methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day 


nerissa

silence bestows that virtue on it  madam 


portia

the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark 
when neither is attended  and i think
the nightingale  if she should sing by day 
when every goose is cackling  would be thought
no better a musician than the wren 
how many things by season season are
to their right praise and true perfection 
peace  ho  the moon sleeps with endymion
and would not be awaked 
music ceases


lorenzo

that is the voice 
or i am much deceived  of portia 


portia

he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo 
by the bad voice 


lorenzo

                  dear lady  welcome home 


portia

we have been praying for our husbands  healths 
which speed  we hope  the better for our words 
are they return d 


lorenzo

                  madam  they are not yet 
but there is come a messenger before 
to signify their coming 


portia

go in  nerissa 
give order to my servants that they take
no note at all of our being absent hence 
nor you  lorenzo  jessica  nor you 
a tucket sounds


lorenzo

your husband is at hand  i hear his trumpet 
we are no tell tales  madam  fear you not 


portia

this night methinks is but the daylight sick 
it looks a little paler   a day 
such as the day is when the sun is hid 
enter bassanio  antonio  gratiano  and their followers


bassanio

we should hold day with the antipodes 
if you would walk in absence of the sun 


portia

let me give light  but let me not be light 
for a light wife doth make a heavy husband 
and never be bassanio so for me 
but god sort all  you are welcome home  my lord 


bassanio

i thank you  madam  give welcome to my friend 
this is the man  this is antonio 
to whom i am so infinitely bound 


portia

you should in all sense be much bound to him 
for  as i hear  he was much bound for you 


antonio

no more than i am well acquitted of 


portia

sir  you are very welcome to our house 
it must appear in other ways than words 
therefore i scant this breathing courtesy 


gratiano

 to nerissa   by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong 
in faith  i gave it to the judge clerk 
would he were gelt that had it  for my part 
since you do take it  love  so much at heart 


portia

a quarrel  ho  already  what the matter 


gratiano

about a hoop of gold  a paltry ring
that she did give me  whose posy was
for all the world like cutler poetry
upon  a knife   me  and leave me not 


nerissa

what talk you of the posy or the value 
you swore to me  when i did give it you 
that you would wear it till your hour of death
and that it should lie with you in your grave 
though not for me  yet for your vehement oaths 
you should have been respective and have kept it 
gave it a judge clerk  no  god my judge 
the clerk will ne wear hair on face that had it 


gratiano

he will  an if he live to be a man 


nerissa

ay  if a woman live to be a man 


gratiano

now  by this hand  i gave it to a youth 
a kind of boy  a little scrubbed boy 
no higher than thyself  the judge clerk 
a prating boy  that begg it as a fee 
i could not for my heart deny it him 


portia

you were to blame  i must be plain with you 
to part so slightly with your wife first gift 
a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
and so riveted with faith unto your flesh 
i gave my love a ring and made him swear
never to part with it  and here he stands 
i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
nor pluck it from his finger  for the wealth
that the world masters  now  in faith  gratiano 
you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief 
an  to me  i should be mad at it 


bassanio

 aside   why  i were best to cut my left hand off
and swear i lost the ring defending it 


gratiano

my lord bassanio gave his ring away
unto the judge that begg it and indeed
deserved it too  and then the boy  his clerk 
that took some pains in writing  he begg mine 
and neither man nor master would take aught
but the two rings 


portia

what ring gave you my lord 
not that  i hope  which you received of me 


bassanio

if i could add a lie unto a fault 
i would deny it  but you see my finger
hath not the ring upon it  it is gone 


portia

even so void is your false heart of truth 
by heaven  i will ne come in your bed
until i see the ring 


nerissa

nor i in yours
till i again see mine 


bassanio

sweet portia 
if you did know to whom i gave the ring 
if you did know for whom i gave the ring
and would conceive for what i gave the ring
and how unwillingly i left the ring 
when nought would be accepted but the ring 
you would abate the strength of your displeasure 


portia

if you had known the virtue of the ring 
or half her worthiness that gave the ring 
or your own honour to contain the ring 
you would not then have parted with the ring 
what man is there so much unreasonable 
if you had pleased to have defended it
with any terms of zeal  wanted the modesty
to urge the thing held as a ceremony 
nerissa teaches me what to believe 
i die for but some woman had the ring 


bassanio

no  by my honour  madam  by my soul 
no woman had it  but a civil doctor 
which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
and begg the ring  the which i did deny him
and suffer him to go displeased away 
even he that did uphold the very life
of my dear friend  what should i say  sweet lady 
i was enforced to send it after him 
i was beset with shame and courtesy 
my honour would not let ingratitude
so much besmear it  pardon me  good lady 
for  by these blessed candles of the night 
had you been there  i think you would have begg 
the ring of me to give the worthy doctor 


portia

let not that doctor e come near my house 
since he hath got the jewel that i loved 
and that which you did swear to keep for me 
i will become as liberal as you 
i not deny him any thing i have 
no  not my body nor my husband bed 
know him i shall  i am well sure of it 
lie not a night from home  watch me like argus 
if you do not  if i be left alone 
now  by mine honour  which is yet mine own 
i have that doctor for my bedfellow 


nerissa

and i his clerk  therefore be well advised
how you do leave me to mine own protection 


gratiano

well  do you so  let not me take him  then 
for if i do  i mar the young clerk pen 


antonio

i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels 


portia

sir  grieve not you  you are welcome notwithstanding 


bassanio

portia  forgive me this enforced wrong 
and  in the hearing of these many friends 
i swear to thee  even by thine own fair eyes 
wherein i see myself 


portia

mark you but that 
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself 
in each eye  one  swear by your double self 
and there an oath of credit 


bassanio

nay  but hear me 
pardon this fault  and by my soul i swear
i never more will break an oath with thee 


antonio

i once did lend my body for his wealth 
which  but for him that had your husband ring 
had quite miscarried  i dare be bound again 
my soul upon the forfeit  that your lord
will never more break faith advisedly 


portia

then you shall be his surety  give him this
and bid him keep it better than the other 


antonio

here  lord bassanio  swear to keep this ring 


bassanio

by heaven  it is the same i gave the doctor 


portia

i had it of him  pardon me  bassanio 
for  by this ring  the doctor lay with me 


nerissa

and pardon me  my gentle gratiano 
for that same scrubbed boy  the doctor clerk 
in lieu of this last night did lie with me 


gratiano

why  this is like the mending of highways
in summer  where the ways are fair enough 
what  are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it 


portia

speak not so grossly  you are all amazed 
here is a letter  read it at your leisure 
it comes from padua  from bellario 
there you shall find that portia was the doctor 
nerissa there her clerk  lorenzo here
shall witness i set forth as soon as you
and even but now return d  i have not yet
enter my house  antonio  you are welcome 
and i have better news in store for you
than you expect  unseal this letter soon 
there you shall find three of your argosies
are richly come to harbour suddenly 
you shall not know by what strange accident
i chanced on this letter 


antonio

i am dumb 


bassanio

were you the doctor and i knew you not 


gratiano

were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold 


nerissa

ay  but the clerk that never means to do it 
unless he live until he be a man 


bassanio

sweet doctor  you shall be my bed fellow 
when i am absent  then lie with my wife 


antonio

sweet lady  you have given me life and living 
for here i read for certain that my ships
are safely come to road 


portia

how now  lorenzo 
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you 


nerissa

ay  and i give them him without a fee 
there do i give to you and jessica 
from the rich jew  a special deed of gift 
after his death  of all he dies possess of 


lorenzo

fair ladies  you drop manna in the way
of starved people 


portia

                  it is almost morning 
and yet i am sure you are not satisfied
of these events at full  let us go in 
and charge us there upon inter gatories 
and we will answer all things faithfully 


gratiano

let it be so  the first inter 
that my nerissa shall be sworn on is 
whether till the next night she had rather stay 
or go to bed now  being two hours to day 
but were the day come  i should wish it dark 
that i were couching with the doctor clerk 
well  while i live i fear no other thing
so sore as keeping safe nerissa ring 
exeunt
