how many thousand of my poorest subjects
are at this hour asleep  o sleep  o gentle sleep 
nature soft nurse  how have i frighted thee 
that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
and steep my senses in forgetfulness 
why rather  sleep  liest thou in smoky cribs 
upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
and hush with buzzing night flies to thy slumber 
than in the perfumed chambers of the great 
under the canopies of costly state 
and lull with sound of sweetest melody 
o thou dull god  why liest thou with the vile
in loathsome beds  and leavest the kingly couch
a watch case or a common  larum bell 
wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
seal up the ship boy eyes  and rock his brains
in cradle of the rude imperious surge
and in the visitation of the winds 
who take the ruffian billows by the top 
curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
with deafening clamour in the slippery clouds 
that  with the hurly  death itself awakes 
canst thou  o partial sleep  give thy repose
to the wet sea boy in an hour so rude 
and in the calmest and most stillest night 
with all appliances and means to boot 
deny it to a king  then happy low  lie down 
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown 
enter warwick and surrey


warwick

many good morrows to your majesty 


king henry iv

is it good morrow  lords 


warwick

 one o clock  and past 


king henry iv

why  then  good morrow to you all  my lords 
have you read o the letters that i sent you 


warwick

we have  my liege 


king henry iv

then you perceive the body of our kingdom
how foul it is  what rank diseases grow
and with what danger  near the heart of it 


warwick

it is but as a body yet distemper d 
which to his former strength may be restored
with good advice and little medicine 
my lord northumberland will soon be cool d 


king henry iv

o god  that one might read the book of fate 
and see the revolution of the times
make mountains level  and the continent 
weary of solid firmness  melt itself
into the sea  and  other times  to see
the beachy girdle of the ocean
too wide for neptune hips  how chances mock 
and changes fill the cup of alteration
with divers liquors  o  if this were seen 
the happiest youth  viewing his progress through 
what perils past  what crosses to ensue 
would shut the book  and sit him down and die 
 not  years gone
since richard and northumberland  great friends 
did feast together  and in two years after
were they at wars  it is but eight years since
this percy was the man nearest my soul 
who like a brother toil in my affairs
and laid his love and life under my foot 
yea  for my sake  even to the eyes of richard
gave him defiance  but which of you was by 
you  cousin nevil  as i may remember 
to warwick
when richard  with his eye brimful of tears 
then cheque and rated by northumberland 
did speak these words  now proved a prophecy 
 northumberland  thou ladder by the which
my cousin bolingbroke ascends my throne 
though then  god knows  i had no such intent 
but that necessity so bow the state
that i and greatness were compell to kiss 
 time shall come  thus did he follow it 
 time will come  that foul sin  gathering head 
shall break into corruption  so went on 
foretelling this same time condition
and the division of our amity 


warwick

there is a history in all men lives 
figuring the nature of the times deceased 
the which observed  a man may prophesy 
with a near aim  of the main chance of things
as yet not come to life  which in their seeds
and weak beginnings lie intreasured 
such things become the hatch and brood of time 
and by the necessary form of this
king richard might create a perfect guess
that great northumberland  then false to him 
would of that seed grow to a greater falseness 
which should not find a ground to root upon 
unless on you 


king henry iv

                  are these things then necessities 
then let us meet them like necessities 
and that same word even now cries out on us 
they say the bishop and northumberland
are fifty thousand strong 


warwick

it cannot be  my lord 
rumour doth double  like the voice and echo 
the numbers of the fear d  please it your grace
to go to bed  upon my soul  my lord 
the powers that you already have sent forth
shall bring this prize in very easily 
to comfort you the more  i have received
a certain instance that glendower is dead 
your majesty hath been this fortnight ill 
and these unseason hours perforce must add
unto your sickness 


king henry iv

i will take your counsel 
and were these inward wars once out of hand 
we would  dear lords  unto the holy land 
exeunt
