what  have i scaped love letters in the holiday 
time of my beauty  and am i now a subject for them 
let me see 
reads
 me no reason why i love you  for though
love use reason for his physician  he admits him
not for his counsellor  you are not young  no more
am i  go to then  there sympathy  you are merry 
so am i  ha  ha  then there more sympathy  you
love sack  and so do i  would you desire better
sympathy  let it suffice thee  mistress page at
the least  if the love of soldier can suffice 
that i love thee  i will not say  pity me   
not a soldier like phrase  but i say  love me  by me 
thine own true knight 
by day or night 
or any kind of light 
with all his might
for thee to fight     john falstaff 
what a herod of jewry is this  o wicked
world  one that is well nigh worn to pieces with
age to show himself a young gallant  what an
unweighed behavior hath this flemish drunkard
picked with the devil name out of my
conversation  that he dares in this manner assay me 
why  he hath not been thrice in my company  what
should i say to him  i was then frugal of my
mirth  heaven forgive me  why  i exhibit a bill
in the parliament for the putting down of men  how
shall i be revenged on him  for revenged i will be 
as sure as his guts are made of puddings 
enter mistress ford


mistress ford

mistress page  trust me  i was going to your house 


mistress page

and  trust me  i was coming to you  you look very
ill 


mistress ford

nay  i ne believe that  i have to show to the contrary 


mistress page

faith  but you do  in my mind 


mistress ford

well  i do then  yet i say i could show you to the
contrary  o mistress page  give me some counsel 


mistress page

what the matter  woman 


mistress ford

o woman  if it were not for one trifling respect  i
could come to such honour 


mistress page

hang the trifle  woman  take the honour  what is
it  dispense with trifles  what is it 


mistress ford

if i would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so 
i could be knighted 


mistress page

what  thou liest  sir alice ford  these knights
will hack  and so thou shouldst not alter the
article of thy gentry 


mistress ford

we burn daylight  here  read  read  perceive how i
might be knighted  i shall think the worse of fat
men  as long as i have an eye to make difference of
men liking  and yet he would not swear  praised
women modesty  and gave such orderly and
well behaved reproof to all uncomeliness  that i
would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
the truth of his words  but they do no more adhere
and keep place together than the hundredth psalm to
the tune of  sleeves  what tempest  i trow 
threw this whale  with so many tuns of oil in his
belly  ashore at windsor  how shall i be revenged
on him  i think the best way were to entertain him
with hope  till the wicked fire of lust have melted
him in his own grease  did you ever hear the like 


mistress page

letter for letter  but that the name of page and
ford differs  to thy great comfort in this mystery
of ill opinions  here the twin brother of thy
letter  but let thine inherit first  for  i
protest  mine never shall  i warrant he hath a
thousand of these letters  writ with blank space for
different names sure  more and these are of the
second edition  he will print them  out of doubt 
for he cares not what he puts into the press  when
he would put us two  i had rather be a giantess 
and lie under mount pelion  well  i will find you
twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man 


mistress ford

why  this is the very same  the very hand  the very
words  what doth he think of us 


mistress page

nay  i know not  it makes me almost ready to
wrangle with mine own honesty  i entertain
myself like one that i am not acquainted withal 
for  sure  unless he know some strain in me  that i
know not myself  he would never have boarded me in this fury 


mistress ford

 boarding  call you it  i be sure to keep him
above deck 


mistress page

so will i	if he come under my hatches  i never
to sea again  let be revenged on him  let 
appoint him a meeting  give him a show of comfort in
his suit and lead him on with a fine baited delay 
till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the garter 


mistress ford

nay  i will consent to act any villany against him 
that may not sully the chariness of our honesty  o 
that my husband saw this letter  it would give
eternal food to his jealousy 


mistress page

why  look where he comes  and my good man too  he 
as far from jealousy as i am from giving him cause 
and that i hope is an unmeasurable distance 


mistress ford

you are the happier woman 


mistress page

let consult together against this greasy knight 
come hither 
they retire
enter ford with pistol  and page with nym


ford

my name is corporal nym  i speak and i avouch   
true  my name is nym and falstaff loves your wife

page

i never heard such a drawling  affecting rogue 


ford

if i do find it  well 


page

o  the town commended him for a true man 


ford

page

ford

do you think there is truth in them 


page

hang  em  slaves  i do not think the knight would
offer it  but these that accuse him in his intent
towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men 
very rogues  now they be out of service 


ford

were they his men 


page

marry  were they 


ford

i like it never the better for that  does he lie at
the garter 


page

ay  marry  does he  if he should intend this voyage
towards my wife  i would turn her loose to him  and
what he gets more of her than sharp words  let it
lie on my head 


ford

i do not misdoubt my wife  but i would be loath to
turn them together  a man may be too confident  i
would have nothing lie on my head  i cannot be thus satisfied
