else  nor that well neither 


falstaff

what thou wert  if fortune thy foe were not  nature
thy friend  come  thou canst not hide it

many of these lisping hawthorn buds  that come like
women in men apparel  and smell like bucklersbury

but thee  and thou deservest it 


mistress ford

day find it

strain were in the same distress

more tricks with falstaff  his dissolute disease will
scarce obey this medicine

quickly  to him  and excuse his throwing into the
