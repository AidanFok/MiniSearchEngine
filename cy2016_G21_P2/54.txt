exeunt justices
on  bardolph  lead the men away 
exeunt bardolph  recruits     c
as i return  i will fetch off these justices  i do
see the bottom of justice shallow  lord  lord  how
subject we old men are to this vice of lying  this
same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
me of the wildness of his youth  and the feats he
hath done about turnbull street  and every third
word a lie  duer paid to the hearer than the turk 
tribute  i do remember him at clement inn like a
man made after supper of a cheese paring  when a 
was naked  he was  for all the world  like a forked
radish  with a head fantastically carved upon it
with a knife  a  was so forlorn  that his
dimensions to any thick sight were invincible  a 
was the very genius of famine  yet lecherous as a
monkey  and the whores called him mandrake  a  came
ever in the rearward of the fashion  and sung those
tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
carmen whistle  and swear they were his fancies or
his good nights  and now is this vice dagger
become a squire  and talks as familiarly of john a
gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him  and
i be sworn a  ne saw him but once in the
tilt yard  and then he burst his head for crowding
among the marshal men  i saw it  and told john a
gaunt he beat his own name  for you might have
thrust him and all his apparel into an eel skin  the
case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him  a
court  and now has he land and beefs  well  i 
be acquainted with him  if i return  and it shall
go hard but i will make him a philosopher two
stones to me  if the young dace be a bait for the
old pike  i see no reason in the law of nature but i
may snap at him  let time shape  and there an end 
exit
