barrow of butcher offal  and to be thrown in the
thames  well  if i be served such another trick 
i have my brains ta out and buttered  and give
them to a dog for a new year gift  the rogues
slighted me into the river with as little remorse as
they would have drowned a blind bitch puppies 
fifteen i  the litter  and you may know by my size
that i have a kind of alacrity in sinking  if the
bottom were as deep as hell  i should down  i had
been drowned  but that the shore was shelvy and
shallow a death that i abhor  for the water swells
a man  and what a thing should i have been when i
had been swelled  i should have been a mountain of mummy

i marvel i hear not of master brook  he sent me word
to stay within  i like his money well  o  here he comes 
enter ford


ford

bless you  sir 


falstaff

now  master brook  you come to know what hath passed
between me and ford wife 


ford

that  indeed  sir john  is my business 


falstaff

master brook  i will not lie to you  i was at her
house the hour she appointed me 


ford

and sped you  sir 


falstaff

very ill favoredly  master brook 


ford

how so  sir  did she change her determination 


falstaff

no  master brook  but the peaking cornuto her
husband  master brook  dwelling in a continual
 of jealousy  comes me in the instant of our
encounter  after we had embraced  kissed  protested 
and  as it were  spoke the prologue of our comedy 
and at his heels a rabble of his companions  thither
provoked and instigated by his distemper  and 
forsooth  to search his house for his wife love 


ford

what  while you were there 


falstaff

while i was there 


ford

and did he search for you  and could not find you 


falstaff

you shall hear  as good luck would have it  comes
in one mistress page  gives intelligence of ford 
approach  and  in her invention and ford wife 
distraction  they conveyed me into a buck basket 


ford

a buck basket 


falstaff

by the lord  a buck basket  rammed me in with foul
shirts and smocks  socks  foul stockings  greasy
napkins  that  master brook  there was the rankest
compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril 


ford

and how long lay you there 


falstaff

nay  you shall hear  master brook  what i have
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good 
being thus crammed in the basket  a couple of ford 
knaves  his hinds  were called forth by their
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
datchet lane  they took me on their shoulders  met
the jealous knave their master in the door  who
asked them once or twice what they had in their
basket  i quaked for fear  lest the lunatic knave
would have searched it  but fate  ordaining he
should be a cuckold  held his hand  well  on went he
for a search  and away went i for foul clothes  but
mark the sequel  master brook  i suffered the pangs
of three several deaths  first  an intolerable
fright  to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell wether  next  to be compassed  like a good
bilbo  in the circumference of a peck  hilt to
point  heel to head  and then  to be stopped in 
like a strong distillation  with stinking clothes
that fretted in their own grease  think of that a
man of my kidney think of that that am as subject
to heat as butter  a man of continual dissolution
and thaw  it was a miracle to scape suffocation 
and in the height of this bath  when i was more than
half stewed in grease  like a dutch dish  to be
thrown into the thames  and cooled  glowing hot 
in that surge  like a horse shoe  think of
that hissing hot think of that  master brook 


ford

in good sadness  i am sorry that for my sake you
have sufferd all this  my suit then is desperate 
you undertake her no more 


falstaff

master brook  i will be thrown into etna  as i have
been into thames  ere i will leave her thus  her
husband is this morning gone a birding  i have
received from her another embassy of meeting   
eight and nine is the hour  master brook 


ford

 past eight already  sir 


falstaff

is it  i will then address me to my appointment 
come to me at your convenient leisure  and you shall
know how i speed  and the conclusion shall be
crowned with your enjoying her  adieu  you shall
have her  master brook  master brook  you shall
cuckold ford 
exit


ford

hum  ha  is this a vision  is this a dream  do i
sleep  master ford awake  awake  master ford 
there a hole made in your best coat  master ford 
this  to be married  this  to have linen
and buck baskets  well  i will proclaim myself
what i am  i will now take the lecher  he is at my
house  he cannot  me   impossible he
should  he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse 
nor into a pepper box  but  lest the devil that
guides him should aid him  i will search
impossible places  though what i am i cannot avoid 
yet to be what i would not shall not make me tame 
if i have horns to make one mad  let the proverb go
with me  i be horn mad
