against all married mankind  so curses all eve 
daughters  of what complexion soever  and so buffets
himself on the forehead  crying   out  peer
out  that any madness i ever yet beheld seemed but
tameness  civility and patience  to this his
distemper he is in now  i am glad the fat knight is not here 


mistress ford

why  does he talk of him 


mistress page

of none but him  and swears he was carried out  the
last time he searched for him  in a basket  protests
to my husband he is now here  and hath drawn him and
the rest of their company from their sport  to make
another experiment of his suspicion  but i am glad
the knight is not here  now he shall see his own foolery 


mistress ford

mistress ford

he will seek there  on my word  neither press 
coffer  chest  trunk  well  vault  but he hath an
abstract for the remembrance of such places  and
goes to them by his note  there is no hiding you in the house 


falstaff

if you go out in your own semblance  you die  sir
john  unless you go out disguised 


mistress ford

how might we disguise him

big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat 
a muffler and a kerchief  and so escape

than a mischief

not have things cool
