sir hugh evans

 one of the best discretions of a  as ever
i did look upon 


page

and did he send you both these letters at an instant 


mistress page

within a quarter of an hour 


ford

pardon me  wife  henceforth do what thou wilt 
i rather will suspect the sun with cold
than thee with wantonness  now doth thy honour stand
in him that was of late an heretic 
as firm as faith 


page

 well   well  no more 
be not as extreme in submission
as in offence 
but let our plot go forward  let our wives
yet once again  to make us public sport 
appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow 
where we may take him and disgrace him for it 


ford

there is no better way than that they spoke of 


page

how  to send him word they meet him in the park
at midnight  fie  fie  he never come 


sir hugh evans

you say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
been grievously peaten as an old  oman  methinks
there should be terrors in him that he should not
come  methinks his flesh is punished  he shall have
no desires 


page

so think i too 


mistress ford

devise but how you use him when he comes 
and let us two devise to bring him thither 


mistress page

there is an old tale goes that herne the hunter 
sometime a keeper here in windsor forest 
doth all the winter time  at still midnight 
walk round about an oak  with great ragg horns 
and there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
and makes milch kine yield blood and shakes a chain
in a most hideous and dreadful manner 
you have heard of such a spirit  and well you know
the superstitious idle headed eld
received and did deliver to our age
this tale of herne the hunter for a truth 


page

why  yet there want not many that do fear
in deep of night to walk by this herne oak 
but what of this 


mistress ford

                  marry  this is our device 
that falstaff at that oak shall meet with us 


page

well  let it not be doubted but he come 
and in this shape when you have brought him thither 
what shall be done with him  what is your plot 


mistress page

that likewise have we thought upon  and thus 
nan page my daughter and my little son
and three or four more of their growth we dress
like urchins  ouphes and fairies  green and white 
with rounds of waxen tapers on their heads 
and rattles in their hands  upon a sudden 
as falstaff  she and i  are newly met 
let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
with some diffused song  upon their sight 
we two in great amazedness will fly 
then let them all encircle him about
and  fairy like  to pinch the unclean knight 
and ask him why  that hour of fairy revel 
in their so sacred paths he dares to tread
in shape profane 


mistress ford

                  and till he tell the truth 
let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
and burn him with their tapers 


mistress page

the truth being known 
we all present ourselves  dis horn the spirit 
and mock him home to windsor 


ford

the children must
be practised well to this  or they ne do t 


sir hugh evans

i will teach the children their behaviors  and i
will be like a jack an apes also  to burn the
knight with my taber 


ford

mistress page

my nan shall be the queen of all the fairies 
finely attired in a robe of white 


page

aside
and in that time
shall master slender steal my nan away
and marry her at eton  go send to falstaff straight

and tricking for our fairies
