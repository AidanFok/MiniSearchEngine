pistol

elves  list your names  silence  you airy toys 
cricket  to windsor chimneys shalt thou leap 
where fires thou find unraked and hearths unswept 
there pinch the maids as blue as bilberry 
our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery 


falstaff

they are fairies  he that speaks to them shall die 
i wink and couch  no man their works must eye 
lies down upon his face


sir hugh evans

where bede  go you  and where you find a maid
that  ere she sleep  has thrice her prayers said 
raise up the organs of her fantasy 
sleep she as sound as careless infancy 
but those as sleep and think not on their sins 
pinch them  arms  legs  backs  shoulders  sides and shins 


mistress quickly

about  about 
search windsor castle  elves  within and out 
strew good luck  ouphes  on every sacred room 
that it may stand till the perpetual doom 
in state as wholesome as in state  fit 
worthy the owner  and the owner it 
the several chairs of order look you scour
with juice of balm and every precious flower 
each fair instalment  coat  and several crest 
with loyal blazon  evermore be blest 
and nightly  meadow fairies  look you sing 
like to the garter compass  in a ring 
the expressure that it bears  green let it be 
more fertile fresh than all the field to see 
and  soit qui mal y pense  write
in emerald tufts  flowers purple  blue and white 
let sapphire  pearl and rich embroidery 
buckled below fair knighthood bending knee 
fairies use flowers for their charactery 
away  disperse  but till  one o clock 
our dance of custom round about the oak
of herne the hunter  let us not forget 


sir hugh evans

pray you  lock hand in hand  yourselves in order set
and twenty glow worms shall our lanterns be 
to guide our measure round about the tree 
but  stay  i smell a man of middle earth

corrupt  corrupt  and tainted in desire 
about him  fairies  sing a scornful rhyme 
and  as you trip  still pinch him to your time 
song 
fie on sinful fantasy 
fie on lust and luxury 
lust is but a bloody fire 
kindled with unchaste desire 
fed in heart  whose flames aspire
as thoughts do blow them  higher and higher 
pinch him  fairies  mutually 
pinch him for his villany 
pinch him  and burn him  and turn him about 
till candles and starlight and moonshine be out 
during this song they pinch falstaff  doctor caius  comes one way  and steals away a boy in green   slender another way  and takes off a boy in white   and fenton comes and steals away ann page   a noise of hunting is heard within  all the  fairies run away  falstaff pulls off his buck head  and rises

ford

ay  and an ox too  both the proofs are extant 


falstaff

and these are not fairies  i was three or four
times in the thought they were not fairies  and yet
the guiltiness of my mind  the sudden surprise of my
powers  drove the grossness of the foppery into a
received belief  in despite of the teeth of all
rhyme and reason  that they were fairies  see now
how wit may be made a jack a lent  when  upon
ill employment

 seese  and  putter  have i lived to stand at the
taunt of one that makes fritters of english  this
is enough to be the decay of lust and late walking
through the realm 


mistress page

why sir john  do you think  though we would have the
virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
and have given ourselves without scruple to hell

master brook  that you have cozened of money  to

a boy for a girl  if i had been married to him  for
all he was in woman apparel  i would not have had

mistress page

why went you not with master doctor  maid 


fenton

you do amaze her  hear the truth of it 
you would have married her most shamefully 
where there was no proportion held in love 
the truth is  she and i  long since contracted 
are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us 
the offence is holy that she hath committed 
and this deceit loses the name of craft 
of disobedience  or unduteous title 
since therein she doth evitate and shun
a thousand irreligious cursed hours 
which forced marriage would have brought upon her 


ford

stand not amazed  here is no remedy 
in love the heavens themselves do guide the state 
money buys lands  and wives are sold by fate

strike at me  that your arrow hath glanced

for he tonight shall lie with mistress ford
