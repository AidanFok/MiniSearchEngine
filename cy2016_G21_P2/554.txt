thought fit  through all athens  to play in our
interlude before the duke and the duchess  on his
wedding day at night

quince

a lover  that kills himself most gallant for love 


bottom

that will ask some tears in the true performing of
it  if i do it  let the audience look to their
eyes  i will move storms  i will condole in some
measure  to the rest  yet my chief humour is for a
tyrant  i could play ercles rarely  or a part to
tear a cat in  to make all split 
the raging rocks
and shivering shocks
shall break the locks
of prison gates 
and phibbus  car
shall shine from far
and make and mar
the foolish fates 
this was lofty  now name the rest of the players 
this is ercles  vein  a tyrant vein  a lover is
more condoling

do any man heart good to hear me  i will roar

i grant you  friends  if that you should fright the
ladies out of their wits  they would have no more

sucking dove  i will roar you an  any
nightingale 


quince

you can play no part but pyramus  for pyramus is a
sweet faced man  a proper man  as one shall see in a
summer day  a most lovely gentleman like man

to play it in

beard  your orange tawny beard  your purple in grain
beard  or your french crown colour beard  your
perfect yellow 


quince

some of your french crowns have no hair at all  and
then you will play bare faced  but  masters  here
are your parts  and i am to entreat you  request
you and desire you  to con them by to morrow night 
and meet me in the palace wood  a mile without the
town  by moonlight  there will we rehearse  for if
we meet in the city  we shall be dogged with
company  and our devices known  in the meantime i
will draw a bill of properties  such as our play
wants  i pray you  fail me not 


bottom

we will meet  and there we may rehearse most
obscenely and courageously  take pains  be perfect  adieu
