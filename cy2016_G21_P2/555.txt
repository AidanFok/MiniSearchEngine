scene i  a wood near athens 


enter  from opposite sides  a fairy  and puck


puck

how now  spirit  whither wander you 


fairy

     over hill  over dale 
thorough bush  thorough brier 
over park  over pale 
thorough flood  thorough fire 
i do wander everywhere 
swifter than the moon sphere 
and i serve the fairy queen 
to dew her orbs upon the green 
the cowslips tall her pensioners be 
in their gold coats spots you see 
those be rubies  fairy favours 
in those freckles live their savours 
i must go seek some dewdrops here
and hang a pearl in every cowslip ear 
farewell  thou lob of spirits  i be gone 
our queen and all our elves come here anon 


puck

the king doth keep his revels here to night 
take heed the queen come not within his sight 
for oberon is passing fell and wrath 
because that she as her attendant hath
a lovely boy  stolen from an indian king 
she never had so sweet a changeling 
and jealous oberon would have the child
knight of his train  to trace the forests wild 
but she perforce withholds the loved boy 
crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy 
and now they never meet in grove or green 
by fountain clear  or spangled starlight sheen 
but  they do square  that all their elves for fear
creep into acorn cups and hide them there 


fairy

either i mistake your shape and making quite 
or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
call robin goodfellow  are not you he
that frights the maidens of the villagery 
skim milk  and sometimes labour in the quern
and bootless make the breathless housewife churn 
and sometime make the drink to bear no barm 
mislead night wanderers  laughing at their harm 
those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck 
you do their work  and they shall have good luck 
are not you he 


puck

                  thou speak aright 
i am that merry wanderer of the night 
i jest to oberon and make him smile
when i a fat and bean fed horse beguile 
neighing in likeness of a filly foal 
and sometime lurk i in a gossip bowl 
in very likeness of a roasted crab 
and when she drinks  against her lips i bob
and on her wither dewlap pour the ale 
the wisest aunt  telling the saddest tale 
sometime for three foot stool mistaketh me 
then slip i from her bum  down topples she 
and  tailor  cries  and falls into a cough 
and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh 
and waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
a merrier hour was never wasted there 
but  room  fairy  here comes oberon 


fairy

and here my mistress  would that he were gone 
enter  from one side  oberon  with his train  from the other  titania  with hers


oberon

ill met by moonlight  proud titania 


titania

what  jealous oberon  fairies  skip hence 
i have forsworn his bed and company 


oberon

tarry  rash wanton  am not i thy lord 


titania

then i must be thy lady  but i know
when thou hast stolen away from fairy land 
and in the shape of corin sat all day 
playing on pipes of corn and versing love
to amorous phillida  why art thou here 
come from the farthest steppe of india 
but that  forsooth  the bouncing amazon 
your buskin mistress and your warrior love 
to theseus must be wedded  and you come
to give their bed joy and prosperity 


oberon

how canst thou thus for shame  titania 
glance at my credit with hippolyta 
knowing i know thy love to theseus 
didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
from perigenia  whom he ravished 
and make him with fair aegle break his faith 
with ariadne and antiopa 


titania

these are the forgeries of jealousy 
and never  since the middle summer spring 
met we on hill  in dale  forest or mead 
by paved fountain or by rushy brook 
or in the beached margent of the sea 
to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind 
but with thy brawls thou hast disturb our sport 
therefore the winds  piping to us in vain 
as in revenge  have suck up from the sea
contagious fogs  which falling in the land
have every pelting river made so proud
that they have overborne their continents 
the ox hath therefore stretch his yoke in vain 
the ploughman lost his sweat  and the green corn
hath rotted ere his youth attain a beard 
the fold stands empty in the drowned field 
and crows are fatted with the murrion flock 
the nine men morris is fill up with mud 
and the quaint mazes in the wanton green
for lack of tread are undistinguishable 
the human mortals want their winter here 
no night is now with hymn or carol blest 
therefore the moon  the governess of floods 
pale in her anger  washes all the air 
that rheumatic diseases do abound 
and thorough this distemperature we see
the seasons alter  hoary headed frosts
far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose 
and on old hiems  thin and icy crown
an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
is  as in mockery  set  the spring  the summer 
the childing autumn  angry winter  change
their wonted liveries  and the mazed world 
by their increase  now knows not which is which 
and this same progeny of evils comes
from our debate  from our dissension 
we are their parents and original 


oberon

do you amend it then  it lies in you 
why should titania cross her oberon 
i do but beg a little changeling boy 
to be my henchman 


titania

                  set your heart at rest 
the fairy land buys not the child of me 
his mother was a votaress of my order 
and  in the spiced indian air  by night 
full often hath she gossip by my side 
and sat with me on neptune yellow sands 
marking the embarked traders on the flood 
when we have laugh to see the sails conceive
and grow big bellied with the wanton wind 
which she  with pretty and with swimming gait
following her womb then rich with my young squire 
would imitate  and sail upon the land 
to fetch me trifles  and return again 
as from a voyage  rich with merchandise 
but she  being mortal  of that boy did die 
and for her sake do i rear up her boy 
and for her sake i will not part with him 


oberon

how long within this wood intend you stay 


titania

perchance till after theseus  wedding day 
if you will patiently dance in our round
and see our moonlight revels  go with us 
if not  shun me  and i will spare your haunts 


oberon

give me that boy  and i will go with thee 


titania

not for thy fairy kingdom  fairies  away 
we shall chide downright  if i longer stay 
exit titania with her train


oberon

well  go thy way  thou shalt not from this grove
till i torment thee for this injury 
my gentle puck  come hither  thou rememberest
since once i sat upon a promontory 
and heard a mermaid on a dolphin back
uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
that the rude sea grew civil at her song
and certain stars shot madly from their spheres 
to hear the sea maid music 


puck

i remember 


oberon

that very time i saw  but thou couldst not 
flying between the cold moon and the earth 
cupid all arm d  a certain aim he took
at a fair vestal throned by the west 
and loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow 
as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts 
but i might see young cupid fiery shaft
quench in the chaste beams of the watery moon 
and the imperial votaress passed on 
in maiden meditation  fancy free 
yet mark i where the bolt of cupid fell 
it fell upon a little western flower 
before milk white  now purple with love wound 
and maidens call it love in idleness 
fetch me that flower  the herb i shew thee once 
the juice of it on sleeping eye lids laid
will make or man or woman madly dote
upon the next live creature that it sees 
fetch me this herb  and be thou here again
ere the leviathan can swim a league 


puck

i put a girdle round about the earth
in forty minutes 
exit


oberon

                  having once this juice 
i watch titania when she is asleep 
and drop the liquor of it in her eyes 
the next thing then she waking looks upon 
be it on lion  bear  or wolf  or bull 
on meddling monkey  or on busy ape 
she shall pursue it with the soul of love 
and ere i take this charm from off her sight 
as i can take it with another herb 
i make her render up her page to me 
but who comes here  i am invisible 
and i will overhear their conference 
enter demetrius  helena  following him


demetrius

i love thee not  therefore pursue me not 
where is lysander and fair hermia 
the one i slay  the other slayeth me 
thou told me they were stolen unto this wood 
and here am i  and wode within this wood 
because i cannot meet my hermia 
hence  get thee gone  and follow me no more 


helena

you draw me  you hard hearted adamant 
but yet you draw not iron  for my heart
is true as steel  leave you your power to draw 
and i shall have no power to follow you 


demetrius

do i entice you  do i speak you fair 
or  rather  do i not in plainest truth
tell you  i do not  nor i cannot love you 


helena

and even for that do i love you the more 
i am your spaniel  and  demetrius 
the more you beat me  i will fawn on you 
use me but as your spaniel  spurn me  strike me 
neglect me  lose me  only give me leave 
unworthy as i am  to follow you 
what worser place can i beg in your love 
and yet a place of high respect with me 
than to be used as you use your dog 


demetrius

tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit 
for i am sick when i do look on thee 


helena

and i am sick when i look not on you 


demetrius

you do impeach your modesty too much 
to leave the city and commit yourself
into the hands of one that loves you not 
to trust the opportunity of night
and the ill counsel of a desert place
with the rich worth of your virginity 


helena

your virtue is my privilege  for that
it is not night when i do see your face 
therefore i think i am not in the night 
nor doth this wood lack worlds of company 
for you in my respect are all the world 
then how can it be said i am alone 
when all the world is here to look on me 


demetrius

i run from thee and hide me in the brakes 
and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts 


helena

the wildest hath not such a heart as you 
run when you will  the story shall be changed 
apollo flies  and daphne holds the chase 
the dove pursues the griffin  the mild hind
makes speed to catch the tiger  bootless speed 
when cowardice pursues and valour flies 


demetrius

i will not stay thy questions  let me go 
or  if thou follow me  do not believe
but i shall do thee mischief in the wood 


helena

ay  in the temple  in the town  the field 
you do me mischief  fie  demetrius 
your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex 
we cannot fight for love  as men may do 
we should be wood and were not made to woo 
exit demetrius
i follow thee and make a heaven of hell 
to die upon the hand i love so well 
exit


oberon

fare thee well  nymph  ere he do leave this grove 
thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love 
re enter puck
hast thou the flower there  welcome  wanderer 


puck

ay  there it is 


oberon

i pray thee  give it me 
i know a bank where the wild thyme blows 
where oxlips and the nodding violet grows 
quite over canopied with luscious woodbine 
with sweet musk roses and with eglantine 
there sleeps titania sometime of the night 
lull in these flowers with dances and delight 
and there the snake throws her enamell skin 
weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in 
and with the juice of this i streak her eyes 
and make her full of hateful fantasies 
take thou some of it  and seek through this grove 
a sweet athenian lady is in love
with a disdainful youth  anoint his eyes 
but do it when the next thing he espies
may be the lady  thou shalt know the man
by the athenian garments he hath on 
effect it with some care  that he may prove
more fond on her than she upon her love 
and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow 


puck

fear not  my lord  your servant shall do so 
exeunt
