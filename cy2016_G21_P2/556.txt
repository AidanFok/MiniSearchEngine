scene ii  another part of the wood 


enter titania  with her train


titania

come  now a roundel and a fairy song 
then  for the third part of a minute  hence 
some to kill cankers in the musk rose buds 
some war with rere mice for their leathern wings 
to make my small elves coats  and some keep back
the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
at our quaint spirits  sing me now asleep 
then to your offices and let me rest 
the fairies sing
you spotted snakes with double tongue 
thorny hedgehogs  be not seen 
newts and blind worms  do no wrong 
come not near our fairy queen 
philomel  with melody
sing in our sweet lullaby 
lulla  lulla  lullaby  lulla  lulla  lullaby 
never harm 
nor spell nor charm 
come our lovely lady nigh 
so  good night  with lullaby 
weaving spiders  come not here 
hence  you long legg spinners  hence 
beetles black  approach not near 
worm nor snail  do no offence 
philomel  with melody     c 


fairy

hence  away  now all is well 
one aloof stand sentinel 
exeunt fairies  titania sleeps
enter oberon and squeezes the flower on titania eyelids


oberon

what thou seest when thou dost wake 
do it for thy true love take 
love and languish for his sake 
be it ounce  or cat  or bear 
pard  or boar with bristled hair 
in thy eye that shall appear
when thou wakest  it is thy dear 
wake when some vile thing is near 
exit
enter lysander and hermia


lysander

fair love  you faint with wandering in the wood 
and to speak troth  i have forgot our way 
we rest us  hermia  if you think it good 
and tarry for the comfort of the day 


hermia

be it so  lysander  find you out a bed 
for i upon this bank will rest my head 


lysander

one turf shall serve as pillow for us both 
one heart  one bed  two bosoms and one troth 


hermia

nay  good lysander  for my sake  my dear 
lie further off yet  do not lie so near 


lysander

o  take the sense  sweet  of my innocence 
love takes the meaning in love conference 
i mean  that my heart unto yours is knit
so that but one heart we can make of it 
two bosoms interchained with an oath 
so then two bosoms and a single troth 
then by your side no bed room me deny 
for lying so  hermia  i do not lie 


hermia

lysander riddles very prettily 
now much beshrew my manners and my pride 
if hermia meant to say lysander lied 
but  gentle friend  for love and courtesy
lie further off  in human modesty 
such separation as may well be said
becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid 
so far be distant  and  good night  sweet friend 
thy love ne alter till thy sweet life end 


lysander

amen  amen  to that fair prayer  say i 
and then end life when i end loyalty 
here is my bed  sleep give thee all his rest 


hermia

with half that wish the wisher eyes be press d 
they sleep
enter puck


puck

through the forest have i gone 
but athenian found i none 
on whose eyes i might approve
this flower force in stirring love 
night and silence who is here 
weeds of athens he doth wear 
this is he  my master said 
despised the athenian maid 
and here the maiden  sleeping sound 
on the dank and dirty ground 
pretty soul  she durst not lie
near this lack love  this kill courtesy 
churl  upon thy eyes i throw
all the power this charm doth owe 
when thou wakest  let love forbid
sleep his seat on thy eyelid 
so awake when i am gone 
for i must now to oberon 
exit
enter demetrius and helena  running


helena

stay  though thou kill me  sweet demetrius 


demetrius

i charge thee  hence  and do not haunt me thus 


helena

o  wilt thou darkling leave me  do not so 


demetrius

stay  on thy peril  i alone will go 
exit


helena

o  i am out of breath in this fond chase 
the more my prayer  the lesser is my grace 
happy is hermia  wheresoe she lies 
for she hath blessed and attractive eyes 
how came her eyes so bright  not with salt tears 
if so  my eyes are oftener wash than hers 
no  no  i am as ugly as a bear 
for beasts that meet me run away for fear 
therefore no marvel though demetrius
do  as a monster fly my presence thus 
what wicked and dissembling glass of mine
made me compare with hermia sphery eyne 
but who is here  lysander  on the ground 
dead  or asleep  i see no blood  no wound 
lysander if you live  good sir  awake 


lysander

 awaking   and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake 
transparent helena  nature shows art 
that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart 
where is demetrius  o  how fit a word
is that vile name to perish on my sword 


helena

do not say so  lysander  say not so
what though he love your hermia  lord  what though 
yet hermia still loves you  then be content 


lysander

content with hermia  no  i do repent
the tedious minutes i with her have spent 
not hermia but helena i love 
who will not change a raven for a dove 
the will of man is by his reason sway d 
and reason says you are the worthier maid 
things growing are not ripe until their season
so i  being young  till now ripe not to reason 
and touching now the point of human skill 
reason becomes the marshal to my will
and leads me to your eyes  where i o 
love stories written in love richest book 


helena

wherefore was i to this keen mockery born 
when at your hands did i deserve this scorn 
is not enough  is not enough  young man 
that i did never  no  nor never can 
deserve a sweet look from demetrius  eye 
but you must flout my insufficiency 
good troth  you do me wrong  good sooth  you do 
in such disdainful manner me to woo 
but fare you well  perforce i must confess
i thought you lord of more true gentleness 
o  that a lady  of one man refused 
should of another therefore be abused 
exit


lysander

she sees not hermia  hermia  sleep thou there 
and never mayst thou come lysander near 
for as a surfeit of the sweetest things
the deepest loathing to the stomach brings 
or as tie heresies that men do leave
are hated most of those they did deceive 
so thou  my surfeit and my heresy 
of all be hated  but the most of me 
and  all my powers  address your love and might
to honour helen and to be her knight 
exit


hermia

 awaking   help me  lysander  help me  do thy best
to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast 
ay me  for pity  what a dream was here 
lysander  look how i do quake with fear 
methought a serpent eat my heart away 
and you sat smiling at his cruel pray 
lysander  what  removed  lysander  lord 
what  out of hearing  gone  no sound  no word 
alack  where are you speak  an if you hear 
speak  of all loves  i swoon almost with fear 
no  then i well perceive you all not nigh
either death or you i find immediately
