oberon

i wonder if titania be awaked 
then  what it was that next came in her eye 
which she must dote on in extremity 
enter puck
here comes my messenger 
how now  mad spirit 
what night rule now about this haunted grove 


puck

my mistress with a monster is in love 
near to her close and consecrated bower 
while she was in her dull and sleeping hour 
a crew of patches  rude mechanicals 
that work for bread upon athenian stalls 
were met together to rehearse a play
intended for great theseus  nuptial day 
the shallowest thick skin of that barren sort 
who pyramus presented  in their sport
forsook his scene and enter in a brake
when i did him at this advantage take 
an ass nole i fixed on his head 
anon his thisbe must be answered 
and forth my mimic comes  when they him spy 
as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye 
or russet pated choughs  many in sort 
rising and cawing at the gun report 
sever themselves and madly sweep the sky 
so  at his sight  away his fellows fly 
and  at our stamp  here o and o one falls 
he murder cries and help from athens calls 
their sense thus weak  lost with their fears
thus strong 
made senseless things begin to do them wrong 
for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch 
some sleeves  some hats  from yielders all
things catch 
i led them on in this distracted fear 
and left sweet pyramus translated there 
when in that moment  so it came to pass 
titania waked and straightway loved an ass 


oberon

this falls out better than i could devise 
but hast thou yet latch the athenian eyes
with the love juice  as i did bid thee do 


puck

i took him sleeping that is finish too 
and the athenian woman by his side 
that  when he waked  of force she must be eyed 
enter hermia and demetrius


oberon

stand close  this is the same athenian 


puck

this is the woman  but not this the man 


demetrius

o  why rebuke you him that loves you so 
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe 


hermia

now i but chide  but i should use thee worse 
for thou  i fear  hast given me cause to curse 
if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep 
being o shoes in blood  plunge in the deep 
and kill me too 
the sun was not so true unto the day
as he to me  would he have stolen away
from sleeping hermia  i believe as soon
this whole earth may be bored and that the moon
may through the centre creep and so displease
her brother noontide with antipodes 
it cannot be but thou hast murder him 
so should a murderer look  so dead  so grim 


demetrius

so should the murder look  and so should i 
pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty 
yet you  the murderer  look as bright  as clear 
as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere 


hermia

what this to my lysander  where is he 
ah  good demetrius  wilt thou give him me 


demetrius

i had rather give his carcass to my hounds 


hermia

out  dog  out  cur  thou drivest me past the bounds
of maiden patience  hast thou slain him  then 
henceforth be never number among men 
o  once tell true  tell true  even for my sake 
durst thou have look upon him being awake 
and hast thou kill him sleeping  o brave touch 
could not a worm  an adder  do so much 
an adder did it  for with doubler tongue
than thine  thou serpent  never adder stung 


demetrius

you spend your passion on a misprised mood 
i am not guilty of lysander blood 
nor is he dead  for aught that i can tell 


hermia

i pray thee  tell me then that he is well 


demetrius

an if i could  what should i get therefore 


hermia

a privilege never to see me more 
and from thy hated presence part i so 
see me no more  whether he be dead or no 
exit


demetrius

there is no following her in this fierce vein 
here therefore for a while i will remain 
so sorrow heaviness doth heavier grow
for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe 
which now in some slight measure it will pay 
if for his tender here i make some stay 
lies down and sleeps


oberon

what hast thou done  thou hast mistaken quite
and laid the love juice on some true love sight 
of thy misprision must perforce ensue
some true love turn and not a false turn true 


puck

then fate o er rules  that  one man holding troth 
a million fail  confounding oath on oath 


oberon

about the wood go swifter than the wind 
and helena of athens look thou find 
all fancy sick she is and pale of cheer 
with sighs of love  that costs the fresh blood dear 
by some illusion see thou bring her here 
i charm his eyes against she do appear 


puck

i go  i go  look how i go 
swifter than arrow from the tartar bow 
exit


oberon

   flower of this purple dye 
hit with cupid archery 
sink in apple of his eye 
when his love he doth espy 
let her shine as gloriously
as the venus of the sky 
when thou wakest  if she be by 
beg of her for remedy 
re enter puck


puck

   captain of our fairy band 
helena is here at hand 
and the youth  mistook by me 
pleading for a lover fee 
shall we their fond pageant see 
lord  what fools these mortals be 


oberon

stand aside  the noise they make
will cause demetrius to awake 


puck

then will two at once woo one 
that must needs be sport alone 
and those things do best please me
that befal preposterously 
enter lysander and helena


lysander

why should you think that i should woo in scorn 
scorn and derision never come in tears 
look  when i vow  i weep  and vows so born 
in their nativity all truth appears 
how can these things in me seem scorn to you 
bearing the badge of faith  to prove them true 


helena

you do advance your cunning more and more 
when truth kills truth  o devilish holy fray 
these vows are hermia s  will you give her o er 
weigh oath with oath  and you will nothing weigh 
your vows to her and me  put in two scales 
will even weigh  and both as light as tales 


lysander

i had no judgment when to her i swore 


helena

nor none  in my mind  now you give her o er 


lysander

demetrius loves her  and he loves not you 


demetrius

 awaking   o helena  goddess  nymph  perfect  divine 
to what  my love  shall i compare thine eyne 
crystal is muddy  o  how ripe in show
thy lips  those kissing cherries  tempting grow 
that pure congealed white  high taurus snow 
fann with the eastern wind  turns to a crow
when thou hold up thy hand  o  let me kiss
this princess of pure white  this seal of bliss 


helena

o spite  o hell  i see you all are bent
to set against me for your merriment 
if you we re civil and knew courtesy 
you would not do me thus much injury 
can you not hate me  as i know you do 
but you must join in souls to mock me too 
if you were men  as men you are in show 
you would not use a gentle lady so 
to vow  and swear  and superpraise my parts 
when i am sure you hate me with your hearts 
you both are rivals  and love hermia 
and now both rivals  to mock helena 
a trim exploit  a manly enterprise 
to conjure tears up in a poor maid eyes
with your derision  none of noble sort
would so offend a virgin  and extort
a poor soul patience  all to make you sport 


lysander

you are unkind  demetrius  be not so 
for you love hermia  this you know i know 
and here  with all good will  with all my heart 
in hermia love i yield you up my part 
and yours of helena to me bequeath 
whom i do love and will do till my death 


helena

never did mockers waste more idle breath 


demetrius

lysander  keep thy hermia  i will none 
if e i loved her  all that love is gone 
my heart to her but as guest wise sojourn d 
and now to helen is it home return d 
there to remain 


lysander

                  helen  it is not so 


demetrius

disparage not the faith thou dost not know 
lest  to thy peril  thou aby it dear 
look  where thy love comes  yonder is thy dear 
re enter hermia


hermia

dark night  that from the eye his function takes 
the ear more quick of apprehension makes 
wherein it doth impair the seeing sense 
it pays the hearing double recompense 
thou art not by mine eye  lysander  found 
mine ear  i thank it  brought me to thy sound
but why unkindly didst thou leave me so 


lysander

why should he stay  whom love doth press to go 


hermia

what love could press lysander from my side 


lysander

lysander love  that would not let him bide 
fair helena  who more engilds the night
than all you fiery oes and eyes of light 
why seek thou me  could not this make thee know 
the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so 


hermia

you speak not as you think  it cannot be 


helena

lo  she is one of this confederacy 
now i perceive they have conjoin all three
to fashion this false sport  in spite of me 
injurious hermia  most ungrateful maid 
have you conspired  have you with these contrived
to bait me with this foul derision 
is all the counsel that we two have shared 
the sisters  vows  the hours that we have spent 
when we have chid the hasty footed time
for parting us o  is it all forgot 
all school days  friendship  childhood innocence 
we  hermia  like two artificial gods 
have with our needles created both one flower 
both on one sampler  sitting on one cushion 
both warbling of one song  both in one key 
as if our hands  our sides  voices and minds 
had been incorporate  so we grow together 
like to a double cherry  seeming parted 
but yet an union in partition 
two lovely berries moulded on one stem 
so  with two seeming bodies  but one heart 
two of the first  like coats in heraldry 
due but to one and crowned with one crest 
and will you rent our ancient love asunder 
to join with men in scorning your poor friend 
it is not friendly   not maidenly 
our sex  as well as i  may chide you for it 
though i alone do feel the injury 


hermia

i am amazed at your passionate words 
i scorn you not  it seems that you scorn me 


helena

have you not set lysander  as in scorn 
to follow me and praise my eyes and face 
and made your other love  demetrius 
who even but now did spurn me with his foot 
to call me goddess  nymph  divine and rare 
precious  celestial  wherefore speaks he this
to her he hates  and wherefore doth lysander
deny your love  so rich within his soul 
and tender me  forsooth  affection 
but by your setting on  by your consent 
what thought i be not so in grace as you 
so hung upon with love  so fortunate 
but miserable most  to love unloved 
this you should pity rather than despise 


hernia

i understand not what you mean by this 


helena

ay  do  persever  counterfeit sad looks 
make mouths upon me when i turn my back 
wink each at other  hold the sweet jest up 
this sport  well carried  shall be chronicled 
if you have any pity  grace  or manners 
you would not make me such an argument 
but fare ye well   partly my own fault 
which death or absence soon shall remedy 


lysander

stay  gentle helena  hear my excuse 
my love  my life my soul  fair helena 


helena

o excellent 


hermia

                  sweet  do not scorn her so 


demetrius

if she cannot entreat  i can compel 


lysander

thou canst compel no more than she entreat 
thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers 
helen  i love thee  by my life  i do 
i swear by that which i will lose for thee 
to prove him false that says i love thee not 


demetrius

i say i love thee more than he can do 


lysander

if thou say so  withdraw  and prove it too 


demetrius

quick  come 


hermia

lysander  whereto tends all this 


lysander

away  you ethiope 


demetrius

                  no  no  he          
seem to break loose  take on as you would follow 
but yet come not  you are a tame man  go 


lysander

hang off  thou cat  thou burr  vile thing  let loose 
or i will shake thee from me like a serpent 


hermia

why are you grown so rude  what change is this 
sweet love 


lysander

thy love  out  tawny tartar  out 
out  loathed medicine  hated potion  hence 


hermia

do you not jest 


helena

yes  sooth  and so do you 


lysander

demetrius  i will keep my word with thee 


demetrius

i would i had your bond  for i perceive
a weak bond holds you  i not trust your word 


lysander

what  should i hurt her  strike her  kill her dead 
although i hate her  i not harm her so 


hermia

what  can you do me greater harm than hate 
hate me  wherefore  o me  what news  my love 
am not i hermia  are not you lysander 
i am as fair now as i was erewhile 
since night you loved me  yet since night you left
me 
why  then you left me o  the gods forbid 
in earnest  shall i say 


lysander

ay  by my life 
and never did desire to see thee more 
therefore be out of hope  of question  of doubt 
be certain  nothing truer   no jest
that i do hate thee and love helena 


hermia

o me  you juggler  you canker blossom 
you thief of love  what  have you come by night
and stolen my love heart from him 


helena

fine  i faith 
have you no modesty  no maiden shame 
no touch of bashfulness  what  will you tear
impatient answers from my gentle tongue 
fie  fie  you counterfeit  you puppet  you 


hermia

puppet  why so  ay  that way goes the game 
now i perceive that she hath made compare
between our statures  she hath urged her height 
and with her personage  her tall personage 
her height  forsooth  she hath prevail with him 
and are you grown so high in his esteem 
because i am so dwarfish and so low 
how low am i  thou painted maypole  speak 
how low am i  i am not yet so low
but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes 


helena

i pray you  though you mock me  gentlemen 
let her not hurt me  i was never curst 
i have no gift at all in shrewishness 
i am a right maid for my cowardice 
let her not strike me  you perhaps may think 
because she is something lower than myself 
that i can match her 


hermia

lower  hark  again 


helena

good hermia  do not be so bitter with me 
i evermore did love you  hermia 
did ever keep your counsels  never wrong you 
save that  in love unto demetrius 
i told him of your stealth unto this wood 
he follow you  for love i follow him 
but he hath chid me hence and threaten me
to strike me  spurn me  nay  to kill me too 
and now  so you will let me quiet go 
to athens will i bear my folly back
and follow you no further  let me go 
you see how simple and how fond i am 


hermia

why  get you gone  who is that hinders you 


helena

a foolish heart  that i leave here behind 


hermia

what  with lysander 


helena

with demetrius 


lysander

be not afraid  she shall not harm thee  helena 


demetrius

no  sir  she shall not  though you take her part 


helena

o  when she angry  she is keen and shrewd 
she was a vixen when she went to school 
and though she be but little  she is fierce 


hermia

 little  again  nothing but  low  and  little 
why will you suffer her to flout me thus 
let me come to her 


lysander

get you gone  you dwarf 
you minimus  of hindering knot grass made 
you bead  you acorn 


demetrius

you are too officious
in her behalf that scorns your services 
let her alone  speak not of helena 
take not her part  for  if thou dost intend
never so little show of love to her 
thou shalt aby it 


lysander

                  now she holds me not 
now follow  if thou darest  to try whose right 
of thine or mine  is most in helena 


demetrius

follow  nay  i go with thee  cheek by jole 
exeunt lysander and demetrius


hermia

you  mistress  all this coil is  of you 
nay  go not back 


helena

                  i will not trust you  i 
nor longer stay in your curst company 
your hands than mine are quicker for a fray 
my legs are longer though  to run away 
exit


hermia

i am amazed  and know not what to say 
exit


oberon

this is thy negligence  still thou mistakest 
or else committ thy knaveries wilfully 


puck

believe me  king of shadows  i mistook 
did not you tell me i should know the man
by the athenian garment be had on 
and so far blameless proves my enterprise 
that i have  an athenian eyes 
and so far am i glad it so did sort
as this their jangling i esteem a sport 


oberon

thou see these lovers seek a place to fight 
hie therefore  robin  overcast the night 
the starry welkin cover thou anon
with drooping fog as black as acheron 
and lead these testy rivals so astray
as one come not within another way 
like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue 
then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong 
and sometime rail thou like demetrius 
and from each other look thou lead them thus 
till o their brows death counterfeiting sleep
with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep 
then crush this herb into lysander eye 
whose liquor hath this virtuous property 
to take from thence all error with his might 
and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight 
when they next wake  all this derision
shall seem a dream and fruitless vision 
and back to athens shall the lovers wend 
with league whose date till death shall never end 
whiles i in this affair do thee employ 
i to my queen and beg her indian boy 
and then i will her charmed eye release
from monster view  and all things shall be peace 


puck

my fairy lord  this must be done with haste 
for night swift dragons cut the clouds full fast 
and yonder shines aurora harbinger 
at whose approach  ghosts  wandering here and there 
troop home to churchyards  damned spirits all 
that in crossways and floods have burial 
already to their wormy beds are gone 
for fear lest day should look their shames upon 
they willfully themselves exile from light
and must for aye consort with black brow night 


oberon

but we are spirits of another sort 
i with the morning love have oft made sport 
and  like a forester  the groves may tread 
even till the eastern gate  all fiery red 
opening on neptune with fair blessed beams 
turns into yellow gold his salt green streams 
but  notwithstanding  haste  make no delay 
we may effect this business yet ere day

for if but once thou show me thy grey light

ho  ho  ho  coward  why comest thou not

and darest not stand  nor look me in the face 
where art thou now

come hither  i am here 


demetrius

nay  then  thou mock me  thou shalt buy this dear 
if ever i thy face by daylight see

helena

o weary night  o long and tedious night 
abate thy hour  shine comforts from the east 
that i may back to athens by daylight 
from these that my poor company detest 
and sleep  that sometimes shuts up sorrow eye 
steal me awhile from mine own company

hermia

never so weary  never so in woe 
bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers 
i can no further crawl  no further go 
my legs can keep no pace with my desires 
here will i rest me till the break of day 
heavens shield lysander  if they mean a fray 
lies down and sleeps


puck

                  on the ground
sleep sound 
i apply
to your eye 
gentle lover  remedy 
squeezing the juice on lysander eyes
when thou wakest 
thou takest
true delight
in the sight
of thy former lady eye 
and the country proverb known 
that every man should take his own 
in your waking shall be shown 
jack shall have jill 
nought shall go ill 
the man shall have his mare again  and all shall be well
