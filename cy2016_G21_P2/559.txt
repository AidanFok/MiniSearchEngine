they sleep
enter puck


oberon

 advancing   welcome  good robin 
see thou this sweet sight 
her dotage now i do begin to pity 
for  meeting her of late behind the wood 
seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool 
i did upbraid her and fall out with her 
for she his hairy temples then had rounded
with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers 
and that same dew  which sometime on the buds
was wont to swell like round and orient pearls 
stood now within the pretty flowerets  eyes
like tears that did their own disgrace bewail 
when i had at my pleasure taunted her
and she in mild terms begg my patience 
i then did ask of her her changeling child 
which straight she gave me  and her fairy sent
to bear him to my bower in fairy land 
and now i have the boy  i will undo
this hateful imperfection of her eyes 
and  gentle puck  take this transformed scalp
from off the head of this athenian swain 
that  he awaking when the other do 
may all to athens back again repair
and think no more of this night accidents
but as the fierce vexation of a dream 
but first i will release the fairy queen 
be as thou wast wont to be 
see as thou wast wont to see 
dian bud o cupid flower
hath such force and blessed power 
now  my titania  wake you  my sweet queen 


titania

my oberon  what visions have i seen 
methought i was enamour of an ass 


oberon

there lies your love 


titania

how came these things to pass 
o  how mine eyes do loathe his visage now 


oberon

silence awhile  robin  take off this head 
titania  music call  and strike more dead
than common sleep of all these five the sense 


titania

music  ho  music  such as charmeth sleep 
music  still


puck

now  when thou wakest  with thine
own fool eyes peep 


oberon

sound  music  come  my queen  take hands with me 
and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be 
now thou and i are new in amity 
and will to morrow midnight solemnly
dance in duke theseus  house triumphantly 
and bless it to all fair prosperity 
there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
wedded  with theseus  all in jollity 


puck

fairy king  attend  and mark 
i do hear the morning lark 


oberon

then  my queen  in silence sad 
trip we after the night shade 
we the globe can compass soon 
swifter than the wandering moon 


titania

come  my lord  and in our flight
tell me how it came this night
that i sleeping here was found
with these mortals on the ground 
exeunt
horns winded within
enter theseus  hippolyta  egeus  and train


theseus

go  one of you  find out the forester 
for now our observation is perform d 
and since we have the vaward of the day 
my love shall hear the music of my hounds 
uncouple in the western valley  let them go 
dispatch  i say  and find the forester 
exit an attendant
we will  fair queen  up to the mountain top 
and mark the musical confusion
of hounds and echo in conjunction 


hippolyta

i was with hercules and cadmus once 
when in a wood of crete they bay the bear
with hounds of sparta  never did i hear
such gallant chiding  for  besides the groves 
the skies  the fountains  every region near
seem all one mutual cry  i never heard
so musical a discord  such sweet thunder 


theseus

my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind 
so flew d  so sanded  and their heads are hung
with ears that sweep away the morning dew 
crook knee d  and dew lapp like thessalian bulls 
slow in pursuit  but match in mouth like bells 
each under each  a cry more tuneable
was never holla to  nor cheer with horn 
in crete  in sparta  nor in thessaly 
judge when you hear  but  soft  what nymphs are these 


egeus

my lord  this is my daughter here asleep 
and this  lysander  this demetrius is 
this helena  old nedar helena 
i wonder of their being here together 


theseus

no doubt they rose up early to observe
the rite of may  and hearing our intent 
came here in grace our solemnity 
but speak  egeus  is not this the day
that hermia should give answer of her choice 


egeus

it is  my lord 


theseus

go  bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns 
horns and shout within  lysander  demetrius  helena  and hermia wake and start up
good morrow  friends  saint valentine is past 
begin these wood birds but to couple now 


lysander

pardon  my lord 


theseus

                  i pray you all  stand up 
i know you two are rival enemies 
how comes this gentle concord in the world 
that hatred is so far from jealousy 
to sleep by hate  and fear no enmity 


lysander

my lord  i shall reply amazedly 
half sleep  half waking  but as yet  i swear 
i cannot truly say how i came here 
but  as i think for truly would i speak 
and now do i bethink me  so it is 
i came with hermia hither  our intent
was to be gone from athens  where we might 
without the peril of the athenian law 


egeus

enough  enough  my lord  you have enough 
i beg the law  the law  upon his head 
they would have stolen away  they would  demetrius 
thereby to have defeated you and me 
you of your wife and me of my consent 
of my consent that she should be your wife 


demetrius

my lord  fair helen told me of their stealth 
of this their purpose hither to this wood 
and i in fury hither follow them 
fair helena in fancy following me 
but  my good lord  i wot not by what power 
but by some power it is my love to hermia 
melted as the snow  seems to me now
as the remembrance of an idle gaud
which in my childhood i did dote upon 
and all the faith  the virtue of my heart 
the object and the pleasure of mine eye 
is only helena  to her  my lord 
was i betroth ere i saw hermia 
but  like in sickness  did i loathe this food 
but  as in health  come to my natural taste 
now i do wish it  love it  long for it 
and will for evermore be true to it 


theseus

fair lovers  you are fortunately met 
of this discourse we more will hear anon 
egeus  i will overbear your will 
for in the temple by and by with us
these couples shall eternally be knit 
and  for the morning now is something worn 
our purposed hunting shall be set aside 
away with us to athens  three and three 
we hold a feast in great solemnity 
come  hippolyta 
exeunt theseus  hippolyta  egeus  and train


demetrius

these things seem small and undistinguishable 


hermia

methinks i see these things with parted eye 
when every thing seems double 


helena

so methinks 
and i have found demetrius like a jewel 
mine own  and not mine own 


demetrius

are you sure
that we are awake  it seems to me
that yet we sleep  we dream  do not you think
the duke was here  and bid us follow him 


hermia

yea  and my father 


helena

and hippolyta 


lysander

and he did bid us follow to the temple 


demetrius

why  then  we are awake  let follow him
and by the way let us recount our dreams 
exeunt


bottom

 awaking   when my cue comes  call me  and i will
answer  my next is   fair pyramus  heigh ho 
peter quince  flute  the bellows mender  snout 
the tinker  starveling  god my life  stolen
hence  and left me asleep  i have had a most rare
vision  i have had a dream  past the wit of man to
say what dream it was  man is but an ass  if he go
about to expound this dream  methought i was there
is no man can tell what  methought i was and
methought i had but man is but a patched fool  if
he will offer to say what methought i had  the eye
of man hath not heard  the ear of man hath not
seen  man hand is not able to taste  his tongue
to conceive  nor his heart to report  what my dream
was  i will get peter quince to write a ballad of
this dream  it shall be called bottom dream 
because it hath no bottom  and i will sing it in the
latter end of a play  before the duke 
peradventure  to make it the more gracious  i shall
sing it at her death
