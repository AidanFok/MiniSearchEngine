lancaster

you are well encounter here  my cousin mowbray 
good day to you  gentle lord archbishop 
and so to you  lord hastings  and to all 
my lord of york  it better show with you
when that your flock  assembled by the bell 
encircled you to hear with reverence
your exposition on the holy text
than now to see you here an iron man 
cheering a rout of rebels with your drum 
turning the word to sword and life to death 
that man that sits within a monarch heart 
and ripens in the sunshine of his favour 
would he abuse the countenance of the king 
alack  what mischiefs might he set abrooch
in shadow of such greatness  with you  lord bishop 
it is even so  who hath not heard it spoken
how deep you were within the books of god 
to us the speaker in his parliament 
to us the imagined voice of god himself 
the very opener and intelligencer
between the grace  the sanctities of heaven
and our dull workings  o  who shall believe
but you misuse the reverence of your place 
employ the countenance and grace of heaven 
as a false favourite doth his prince name 
in deeds dishonourable  you have ta up 
under the counterfeited zeal of god 
the subjects of his substitute  my father 
and both against the peace of heaven and him
have here up swarm them 


archbishop of york

good my lord of lancaster 
i am not here against your father peace 
but  as i told my lord of westmoreland 
the time misorder doth  in common sense 
crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form 
to hold our safety up  i sent your grace
the parcels and particulars of our grief 
the which hath been with scorn shoved from the court 
whereon this hydra son of war is born 
whose dangerous eyes may well be charm asleep
with grant of our most just and right desires 
and true obedience  of this madness cured 
stoop tamely to the foot of majesty 


mowbray

if not  we ready are to try our fortunes
to the last man 


hastings

                  and though we here fall down 
we have supplies to second our attempt 
if they miscarry  theirs shall second them 
and so success of mischief shall be born
and heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
whiles england shall have generation 


lancaster

you are too shallow  hastings  much too shallow 
to sound the bottom of the after times 


westmoreland

pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
how far forth you do like their articles 


lancaster

i like them all  and do allow them well 
and swear here  by the honour of my blood 
my father purposes have been mistook 
and some about him have too lavishly
wrested his meaning and authority 
my lord  these griefs shall be with speed redress d 
upon my soul  they shall  if this may please you 
discharge your powers unto their several counties 
as we will ours  and here between the armies
let drink together friendly and embrace 
that all their eyes may bear those tokens home
of our restored love and amity 


archbishop of york

i take your princely word for these redresses 


lancaster

i give it you  and will maintain my word 
and thereupon i drink unto your grace 


hastings

go  captain  and deliver to the army
this news of peace  let them have pay  and part 
i know it will well please them  hie thee  captain 
exit officer


archbishop of york

to you  my noble lord of westmoreland 


westmoreland

i pledge your grace  and  if you knew what pains
i have bestow to breed this present peace 
you would drink freely  but my love to ye
shall show itself more openly hereafter 


archbishop of york

i do not doubt you 


westmoreland

i am glad of it 
health to my lord and gentle cousin  mowbray 


mowbray

you wish me health in very happy season 
for i am  on the sudden  something ill 


archbishop of york

against ill chances men are ever merry 
but heaviness foreruns the good event 


westmoreland

therefore be merry  coz  since sudden sorrow
serves to say thus   good thing comes
to morrow 


archbishop of york

believe me  i am passing light in spirit 


mowbray

so much the worse  if your own rule be true 
shouts within


lancaster

the word of peace is render d  hark  how they shout 


mowbray

this had been cheerful after victory 


archbishop of york

a peace is of the nature of a conquest 
for then both parties nobly are subdued 
and neither party loser 


lancaster

go  my lord 
and let our army be discharged too 
exit westmoreland
and  good my lord  so please you  let our trains
march  by us  that we may peruse the men
we should have coped withal 


archbishop of york

go  good lord hastings 
and  ere they be dismissed  let them march by 
exit hastings


lancaster

i trust  lords  we shall lie to night together 
re enter westmoreland
now  cousin  wherefore stands our army still 


westmoreland

the leaders  having charge from you to stand 
will not go off until they hear you speak 


lancaster

they know their duties 
re enter hastings


hastings

my lord  our army is dispersed already 
like youthful steers unyoked  they take their courses
east  west  north  south  or  like a school broke up 
each hurries toward his home and sporting place 


westmoreland

good tidings  my lord hastings  for the which
i do arrest thee  traitor  of high treason 
and you  lord archbishop  and you  lord mowbray 
of capitol treason i attach you both 


mowbray

is this proceeding just and honourable 


westmoreland

is your assembly so 


archbishop of york

will you thus break your faith 


lancaster

i pawn thee none 
i promised you redress of these same grievances
whereof you did complain  which  by mine honour 
i will perform with a most christian care 
but for you  rebels  look to taste the due
meet for rebellion and such acts as yours 
most shallowly did you these arms commence 
fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence 
strike up our drums  pursue the scatter stray 
god  and not we  hath safely fought to day 
some guard these traitors to the block of death 
treason true bed and yielder up of breath 
exeunt
