have you sent to bottom house   is he come home yet 


starveling

he cannot be heard of  out of doubt he is
transported 


flute

if he come not  then the play is marred  it goes
not forward  doth it 


quince

it is not possible  you have not a man in all
athens able to discharge pyramus but he 


flute

no  he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
man in athens 


quince

yea and the best person too  and he is a very
paramour for a sweet voice 


flute

you must say  paragon  a paramour is  god bless us 
a thing of naught 
enter snug


snug

masters  the duke is coming from the temple  and
there is two or three lords and ladies more married 
if our sport had gone forward  we had all been made
men 


flute

o sweet bully bottom  thus hath he lost sixpence a
day during his life  he could not have  
sixpence a day  an the duke had not given him
sixpence a day for playing pyramus  i be hanged 
he would have deserved it  sixpence a day in
pyramus  or nothing 
enter bottom


bottom

where are these lads  where are these hearts 


quince

bottom  o most courageous day  o most happy hour 


bottom

masters  i am to discourse wonders  but ask me not
what  for if i tell you  i am no true athenian  i
will tell you every thing  right as it fell out 


quince

let us hear  sweet bottom 


bottom

not a word of me  all that i will tell you is  that
the duke hath dined  get your apparel together 
good strings to your beards  new ribbons to your
pumps  meet presently at the palace  every man look
o his part  for the short and the long is  our
play is preferred  in any case  let thisby have
clean linen  and let not him that plays the lion
pair his nails  for they shall hang out for the
lion claws  and  most dear actors  eat no onions
nor garlic  for we are to utter sweet breath  and i
do not doubt but to hear them say  it is a sweet
comedy  no more words  away  go  away
