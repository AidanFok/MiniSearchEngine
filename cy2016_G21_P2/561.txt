hippolyta

 strange my theseus  that these
lovers speak of 


theseus

more strange than true  i never may believe
these antique fables  nor these fairy toys 
lovers and madmen have such seething brains 
such shaping fantasies  that apprehend
more than cool reason ever comprehends 
the lunatic  the lover and the poet
are of imagination all compact 
one sees more devils than vast hell can hold 
that is  the madman  the lover  all as frantic 
sees helen beauty in a brow of egypt 
the poet eye  in fine frenzy rolling 
doth glance from heaven to earth  from earth to heaven 
and as imagination bodies forth
the forms of things unknown  the poet pen
turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
a local habitation and a name 
such tricks hath strong imagination 
that if it would but apprehend some joy 
it comprehends some bringer of that joy 
or in the night  imagining some fear 
how easy is a bush supposed a bear 


hippolyta

but all the story of the night told over 
and all their minds transfigured so together 
more witnesseth than fancy images
and grows to something of great constancy 
but  howsoever  strange and admirable 


theseus

here come the lovers  full of joy and mirth 
enter lysander  demetrius  hermia  and helena
joy  gentle friends  joy and fresh days of love
accompany your hearts 


lysander

more than to us
wait in your royal walks  your board  your bed 


theseus

come now  what masques  what dances shall we have 
to wear away this long age of three hours
between our after supper and bed time 
where is our usual manager of mirth 
what revels are in hand  is there no play 
to ease the anguish of a torturing hour 
call philostrate 


philostrate

                  here  mighty theseus 


theseus

say  what abridgement have you for this evening 
what masque  what music  how shall we beguile
the lazy time  if not with some delight 


philostrate

there is a brief how many sports are ripe 
make choice of which your highness will see first 
giving a paper


theseus

 reads    battle with the centaurs  to be sung
by an athenian eunuch to the harp 
we none of that  that have i told my love 
in glory of my kinsman hercules 
reads
 riot of the tipsy bacchanals 
tearing the thracian singer in their rage 
that is an old device  and it was play 
when i from thebes came last a conqueror 
reads
 thrice three muses mourning for the death
of learning  late deceased in beggary 
that is some satire  keen and critical 
not sorting with a nuptial ceremony 
reads
 tedious brief scene of young pyramus
and his love thisbe  very tragical mirth 
merry and tragical  tedious and brief 
that is  hot ice and wondrous strange snow 
how shall we find the concord of this discord 


philostrate

a play there is  my lord  some ten words long 
which is as brief as i have known a play 
but by ten words  my lord  it is too long 
which makes it tedious  for in all the play
there is not one word apt  one player fitted 
and tragical  my noble lord  it is 
for pyramus therein doth kill himself 
which  when i saw rehearsed  i must confess 
made mine eyes water  but more merry tears
the passion of loud laughter never shed 


theseus

what are they that do play it 


philostrate

hard handed men that work in athens here 
which never labour in their minds till now 
and now have toil their unbreathed memories
with this same play  against your nuptial 


theseus

and we will hear it 


philostrate

no  my noble lord 
it is not for you  i have heard it over 
and it is nothing  nothing in the world 
unless you can find sport in their intents 
extremely stretch and conn with cruel pain 
to do you service 


theseus

                  i will hear that play 
for never anything can be amiss 
when simpleness and duty tender it 
go  bring them in  and take your places  ladies 
exit philostrate


hippolyta

i love not to see wretchedness o charged
and duty in his service perishing 


theseus

why  gentle sweet  you shall see no such thing 


hippolyta

he says they can do nothing in this kind 


theseus

the kinder we  to give them thanks for nothing 
our sport shall be to take what they mistake 
and what poor duty cannot do  noble respect
takes it in might  not merit 
where i have come  great clerks have purposed
to greet me with premeditated welcomes 
where i have seen them shiver and look pale 
make periods in the midst of sentences 
throttle their practised accent in their fears
and in conclusion dumbly have broke off 
not paying me a welcome  trust me  sweet 
out of this silence yet i pick a welcome 
and in the modesty of fearful duty
i read as much as from the rattling tongue
of saucy and audacious eloquence 
love  therefore  and tongue tied simplicity
in least speak most  to my capacity

philostrate

so please your grace  the prologue is address d 


theseus

let him approach 
flourish of trumpets
enter quince for the prologue


prologue

if we offend  it is with our good will 
that you should think  we come not to offend 
but with good will  to show our simple skill 
that is the true beginning of our end 
consider then we come but in despite 
we do not come as minding to contest you 
our true intent is  all for your delight
we are not here  that you should here repent you 
the actors are at hand and by their show
you shall know all that you are like to know 


theseus

this fellow doth not stand upon points 


lysander

he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt  he knows
not the stop  a good moral  my lord  it is not
enough to speak  but to speak true 


hippolyta

indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
on a recorder  a sound  but not in government 


theseus

his speech  was like a tangled chain  nothing
impaired  but all disordered  who is next 
enter pyramus and thisbe  wall  moonshine  and lion


prologue

gentles  perchance you wonder at this show 
but wonder on  till truth make all things plain 
this man is pyramus  if you would know 
this beauteous lady thisby is certain 
this man  with lime and rough cast  doth present
wall  that vile wall which did these lovers sunder 
and through wall chink  poor souls  they are content
to whisper  at the which let no man wonder 
this man  with lanthorn  dog  and bush of thorn 
presenteth moonshine  for  if you will know 
by moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
to meet at ninus  tomb  there  there to woo 
this grisly beast  which lion hight by name 
the trusty thisby  coming first by night 
did scare away  or rather did affright 
and  as she fled  her mantle she did fall 
which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain 
anon comes pyramus  sweet youth and tall 
and finds his trusty thisby mantle slain 
whereat  with blade  with bloody blameful blade 
he bravely broach is boiling bloody breast 
and thisby  tarrying in mulberry shade 
his dagger drew  and died  for all the rest 
let lion  moonshine  wall  and lovers twain
at large discourse  while here they do remain 
exeunt prologue  thisbe  lion  and moonshine


theseus

i wonder if the lion be to speak 


demetrius

no wonder  my lord  one lion may  when many asses do 


wall

in this same interlude it doth befall
that i  one snout by name  present a wall 
and such a wall  as i would have you think 
that had in it a crannied hole or chink 
through which the lovers  pyramus and thisby 
did whisper often very secretly 
this loam  this rough cast and this stone doth show
that i am that same wall  the truth is so 
and this the cranny is  right and sinister 
through which the fearful lovers are to whisper 


theseus

would you desire lime and hair to speak better 


demetrius

it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard
discourse  my lord 
enter pyramus


theseus

pyramus draws near the wall  silence 


pyramus

o grim look night  o night with hue so black 
o night  which ever art when day is not 
o night  o night  alack  alack  alack 
i fear my thisby promise is forgot 
and thou  o wall  o sweet  o lovely wall 
that stand between her father ground and mine 
thou wall  o wall  o sweet and lovely wall 
show me thy chink  to blink through with mine eyne 
wall holds up his fingers
thanks  courteous wall  jove shield thee well for this 
but what see i  no thisby do i see 
o wicked wall  through whom i see no bliss 
cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me 


theseus

the wall  methinks  being sensible  should curse again 


pyramus

no  in truth  sir  he should not   me 
is thisby cue  she is to enter now  and i am to
spy her through the wall  you shall see  it will
fall pat as i told you  yonder she comes 
enter thisbe


thisbe

o wall  full often hast thou heard my moans 
for parting my fair pyramus and me 
my cherry lips have often kiss thy stones 
thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee 


pyramus

i see a voice  now will i to the chink 
to spy an i can hear my thisby face  thisby 


thisbe

my love thou art  my love i think 


pyramus

think what thou wilt  i am thy lover grace 
and  like limander  am i trusty still 


thisbe

and i like helen  till the fates me kill 


pyramus

not shafalus to procrus was so true 


thisbe

as shafalus to procrus  i to you 


pyramus

o kiss me through the hole of this vile wall 


thisbe

i kiss the wall hole  not your lips at all 


pyramus

wilt thou at ninny tomb meet me straightway 


thisbe

 life   death  i come without delay 
exeunt pyramus and thisbe


wall

thus have i  wall  my part discharged so 
and  being done  thus wall away doth go 
exit


theseus

now is the mural down between the two neighbours 


demetrius

no remedy  my lord  when walls are so wilful to hear
without warning 


hippolyta

this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard 


theseus

the best in this kind are but shadows  and the worst
are no worse  if imagination amend them 


hippolyta

it must be your imagination then  and not theirs 


theseus

if we imagine no worse of them than they of
themselves  they may pass for excellent men  here
come two noble beasts in  a man and a lion 
enter lion and moonshine


lion

you  ladies  you  whose gentle hearts do fear
the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor 
may now perchance both quake and tremble here 
when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar 
then know that i  one snug the joiner  am
a lion fell  nor else no lion dam 
for  if i should as lion come in strife
into this place   pity on my life 


theseus

a very gentle beast  of a good conscience 


demetrius

the very best at a beast  my lord  that e i saw 


lysander

this lion is a very fox for his valour 


theseus

true  and a goose for his discretion 


demetrius

not so  my lord  for his valour cannot carry his
discretion  and the fox carries the goose 


theseus

his discretion  i am sure  cannot carry his valour 
for the goose carries not the fox  it is well 
leave it to his discretion  and let us listen to the moon 


moonshine

this lanthorn doth the horned moon present 


demetrius

he should have worn the horns on his head 


theseus

he is no crescent  and his horns are
invisible within the circumference 


moonshine

this lanthorn doth the horned moon present 
myself the man i  the moon do seem to be 


theseus

this is the greatest error of all the rest  the man
should be put into the lanthorn  how is it else the
man i  the moon 


demetrius

he dares not come there for the candle  for  you
see  it is already in snuff 


hippolyta

i am aweary of this moon  would he would change 


theseus

it appears  by his small light of discretion  that
he is in the wane  but yet  in courtesy  in all
reason  we must stay the time 


lysander

proceed  moon 


moonshine

all that i have to say  is  to tell you that the
lanthorn is the moon  i  the man in the moon  this
thorn bush  my thorn bush  and this dog  my dog 


demetrius

why  all these should be in the lanthorn  for all
these are in the moon  but  silence  here comes thisbe 
enter thisbe


thisbe

this is old ninny tomb  where is my love 


lion

 roaring   oh 
thisbe runs off


demetrius

well roared  lion 


theseus

well run  thisbe 


hippolyta

well shone  moon  truly  the moon shines with a
good grace 
the lion shakes thisbe mantle  and exit


theseus

well moused  lion 


lysander

and so the lion vanished 


demetrius

and then came pyramus 
enter pyramus


pyramus

sweet moon  i thank thee for thy sunny beams 
i thank thee  moon  for shining now so bright 
for  by thy gracious  golden  glittering gleams 
i trust to take of truest thisby sight 
but stay  o spite 
but mark  poor knight 
what dreadful dole is here 
eyes  do you see 
how can it be 
o dainty duck  o dear 
thy mantle good 
what  stain with blood 
approach  ye furies fell 
o fates  come  come 
cut thread and thrum 
quail  crush  conclude  and quell 


theseus

this passion  and the death of a dear friend  would
go near to make a man look sad 


hippolyta

beshrew my heart  but i pity the man 


pyramus

o wherefore  nature  didst thou lions frame 
since lion vile hath here deflower my dear 
which is no  no which was the fairest dame
that lived  that loved  that liked  that look 
with cheer 
come  tears  confound 
out  sword  and wound
the pap of pyramus 
ay  that left pap 
where heart doth hop 
stabs himself
thus die i  thus  thus  thus 
now am i dead 
now am i fled 
my soul is in the sky 
tongue  lose thy light 
moon take thy flight 
exit moonshine
now die  die  die  die  die 
dies


demetrius

no die  but an ace  for him  for he is but one 


lysander

less than an ace  man  for he is dead  he is nothing 


theseus

with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover  and
prove an ass 


hippolyta

how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes
back and finds her lover 


theseus

she will find him by starlight  here she comes  and
her passion ends the play 
re enter thisbe


hippolyta

methinks she should not use a long one for such a
pyramus  i hope she will be brief 


demetrius

a mote will turn the balance  which pyramus  which
thisbe  is the better  he for a man  god warrant us 
she for a woman  god bless us 


lysander

she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes 


demetrius

and thus she means  videlicet 


thisbe

          asleep  my love 
what  dead  my dove 
o pyramus  arise 
speak  speak  quite dumb 
dead  dead  a tomb
must cover thy sweet eyes 
these my lips 
this cherry nose 
these yellow cowslip cheeks 
are gone  are gone 
lovers  make moan 
his eyes were green as leeks 
o sisters three 
come  come to me 
with hands as pale as milk 
lay them in gore 
since you have shore
with shears his thread of silk 
tongue  not a word 
come  trusty sword 
come  blade  my breast imbrue 
stabs herself
and  farewell  friends 
thus thisby ends 
adieu  adieu  adieu 
dies


theseus

moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead 


demetrius

ay  and wall too 


bottom

 starting up   no assure you  the wall is down that
parted their fathers  will it please you to see the
epilogue  or to hear a bergomask dance between two
of our company 


theseus

no epilogue  i pray you  for your play needs no
excuse  never excuse  for when the players are all
dead  there needs none to be blamed  marry  if he
that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself
in thisbe garter  it would have been a fine
tragedy  and so it is  truly  and very notably
discharged  but come  your bergomask  let your
epilogue alone 
a dance
the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve 
lovers  to bed   almost fairy time 
i fear we shall out sleep the coming morn
as much as we this night have overwatch d 
this palpable gross play hath well beguiled
the heavy gait of night  sweet friends  to bed 
a fortnight hold we this solemnity 
in nightly revels and new jollity 
exeunt
enter puck


puck

     now the hungry lion roars 
and the wolf behowls the moon 
whilst the heavy ploughman snores 
all with weary task fordone 
now the wasted brands do glow 
whilst the screech owl  screeching loud 
puts the wretch that lies in woe
in remembrance of a shroud 
now it is the time of night
that the graves all gaping wide 
every one lets forth his sprite 
in the church way paths to glide 
and we fairies  that do run
by the triple hecate team 
from the presence of the sun 
following darkness like a dream 
now are frolic  not a mouse
shall disturb this hallow house 
i am sent with broom before 
to sweep the dust behind the door 
enter oberon and titania with their train


oberon

     through the house give gathering light 
by the dead and drowsy fire 
every elf and fairy sprite
hop as light as bird from brier 
and this ditty  after me 
sing  and dance it trippingly 


titania

first  rehearse your song by rote
to each word a warbling note 
hand in hand  with fairy grace 
will we sing  and bless this place 
song and dance


oberon

now  until the break of day 
through this house each fairy stray 
to the best bride bed will we 
which by us shall blessed be 
and the issue there create
ever shall be fortunate 
so shall all the couples three
ever true in loving be 
and the blots of nature hand
shall not in their issue stand 
never mole  hare lip  nor scar 
nor mark prodigious  such as are
despised in nativity 
shall upon their children be 
with this field dew consecrate 
every fairy take his gait 
and each several chamber bless 
through this palace  with sweet peace 
and the owner of it blest
ever shall in safety rest 
trip away  make no stay 
meet me all by break of day 
exeunt oberon  titania  and train


puck

if we shadows have offended 
think but this  and all is mended 
that you have but slumber here
while these visions did appear 
and this weak and idle theme 
no more yielding but a dream 
gentles  do not reprehend 
if you pardon  we will mend 
and  as i am an honest puck 
if we have unearned luck
now to  the serpent tongue 
we will make amends ere long 
else the puck a liar call 
so  good night unto you all 
give me your hands  if we be friends 
and robin shall restore amends
