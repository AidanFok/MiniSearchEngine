scene iii  the same 


enter don john and conrade


conrade

what the good year  my lord  why are you thus out
of measure sad 


don john

there is no measure in the occasion that breeds 
therefore the sadness is without limit 


conrade

you should hear reason 


don john

and when i have heard it  what blessing brings it 


conrade

if not a present remedy  at least a patient
sufferance 


don john

i wonder that thou  being  as thou sayest thou art 
born under saturn  goest about to apply a moral
medicine to a mortifying mischief  i cannot hide
what i am  i must be sad when i have cause and smile
at no man jests  eat when i have stomach and wait
for no man leisure  sleep when i am drowsy and
tend on no man business  laugh when i am merry and
claw no man in his humour 


conrade

yea  but you must not make the full show of this
till you may do it without controlment  you have of
late stood out against your brother  and he hath
ta you newly into his grace  where it is
impossible you should take true root but by the
fair weather that you make yourself  it is needful
that you frame the season for your own harvest 


don john

i had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
his grace  and it better fits my blood to be
disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
love from any  in this  though i cannot be said to
be a flattering honest man  it must not be denied
but i am a plain dealing villain  i am trusted with
a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog  therefore i
have decreed not to sing in my cage  if i had my
mouth  i would bite  if i had my liberty  i would do
my liking  in the meantime let me be that i am and
seek not to alter me 


conrade

can you make no use of your discontent 


don john

i make all use of it  for i use it only 
who comes here 
enter borachio
what news  borachio 


borachio

i came yonder from a great supper  the prince your
brother is royally entertained by leonato  and i
can give you intelligence of an intended marriage 


don john

will it serve for any model to build mischief on 
what is he for a fool that betroths himself to
unquietness 


borachio

marry  it is your brother right hand 


don john

who  the most exquisite claudio 


borachio

even he 


don john

a proper squire  and who  and who  which way looks
he 


borachio

marry  on hero  the daughter and heir of leonato 


don john

a very forward march chick  how came you to this 


borachio

being entertained for a perfumer  as i was smoking a
musty room  comes me the prince and claudio  hand
in hand in sad conference  i whipt me behind the
arras  and there heard it agreed upon that the
prince should woo hero for himself  and having
obtained her  give her to count claudio 


don john

come  come  let us thither  this may prove food to
my displeasure  that young start up hath all the
glory of my overthrow  if i can cross him any way  i
bless myself every way  you are both sure  and will assist me 


conrade

to the death  my lord 


don john

let us to the great supper  their cheer is the
greater that i am subdued  would the cook were of
my mind  shall we go prove what to be done 


borachio

we wait upon your lordship
