scene i  a hall in leonato house 


enter leonato  antonio  hero  beatrice  and others


leonato

was not count john here at supper 


antonio

i saw him not 


beatrice

how tartly that gentleman looks  i never can see
him but i am heart burned an hour after 


hero

he is of a very melancholy disposition 


beatrice

he were an excellent man that were made just in the
midway between him and benedick  the one is too
like an image and says nothing  and the other too
like my lady eldest son  evermore tattling 


leonato

then half signior benedick tongue in count john 
mouth  and half count john melancholy in signior
benedick face 


beatrice

with a good leg and a good foot  uncle  and money
enough in his purse  such a man would win any woman
in the world  if a  could get her good will 


leonato

by my troth  niece  thou wilt never get thee a
husband  if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue 


antonio

in faith  she too curst 


beatrice

too curst is more than curst  i shall lessen god 
sending that way  for it is said   sends a curst
cow short horns  but to a cow too curst he sends none 


leonato

so  by being too curst  god will send you no horns 


beatrice

just  if he send me no husband  for the which
blessing i am at him upon my knees every morning and
evening  lord  i could not endure a husband with a
beard on his face  i had rather lie in the woollen 


leonato

you may light on a husband that hath no beard 


beatrice

what should i do with him  dress him in my apparel
and make him my waiting gentlewoman  he that hath a
beard is more than a youth  and he that hath no
beard is less than a man  and he that is more than
a youth is not for me  and he that is less than a
man  i am not for him  therefore  i will even take
sixpence in earnest of the bear ward  and lead his
apes into hell 


leonato

well  then  go you into hell 


beatrice

no  but to the gate  and there will the devil meet
me  like an old cuckold  with horns on his head  and
say  you to heaven  beatrice  get you to
heaven  here no place for you maids  so deliver
i up my apes  and away to saint peter for the
heavens  he shows me where the bachelors sit  and
there live we as merry as the day is long 


antonio

 to hero   well  niece  i trust you will be ruled
by your father 


beatrice

yes  faith  it is my cousin duty to make curtsy
and say  father  as it please you  but yet for all
that  cousin  let him be a handsome fellow  or else
make another curtsy and say  father  as it please
me 


leonato

well  niece  i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband 


beatrice

not till god make men of some other metal than
earth  would it not grieve a woman to be
overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust  to make
an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl 
no  uncle  i none  adam sons are my brethren 
and  truly  i hold it a sin to match in my kindred 


leonato

daughter  remember what i told you  if the prince
do solicit you in that kind  you know your answer 


beatrice

the fault will be in the music  cousin  if you be
not wooed in good time  if the prince be too
important  tell him there is measure in every thing
and so dance out the answer  for  hear me  hero 
wooing  wedding  and repenting  is as a scotch jig 
a measure  and a cinque pace  the first suit is hot
and hasty  like a scotch jig  and full as
fantastical  the wedding  mannerly modest  as a
measure  full of state and ancientry  and then comes
repentance and  with his bad legs  falls into the
cinque pace faster and faster  till he sink into his grave 


leonato

cousin  you apprehend passing shrewdly 


beatrice

i have a good eye  uncle  i can see a church by daylight 


leonato

the revellers are entering  brother  make good room 
all put on their masks
enter don pedro  claudio  benedick  balthasar  don john  borachio  margaret  ursula and others  masked


don pedro

lady  will you walk about with your friend 


hero

so you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing 
i am yours for the walk  and especially when i walk away 


don pedro

with me in your company 


hero

i may say so  when i please 


don pedro

and when please you to say so 


hero

when i like your favour  for god defend the lute
should be like the case 


don pedro

my visor is philemon roof  within the house is jove 


hero

why  then  your visor should be thatched 


don pedro

speak low  if you speak love 
drawing her aside


balthasar

well  i would you did like me 


margaret

so would not i  for your own sake  for i have many
ill qualities 


balthasar

which is one 


margaret

i say my prayers aloud 


balthasar

i love you the better  the hearers may cry  amen 


margaret

god match me with a good dancer 


balthasar

amen 


margaret

and god keep him out of my sight when the dance is
done  answer  clerk 


balthasar

no more words  the clerk is answered 


ursula

i know you well enough  you are signior antonio 


antonio

at a word  i am not 


ursula

i know you by the waggling of your head 


antonio

to tell you true  i counterfeit him 


ursula

you could never do him so ill well  unless you were
the very man  here his dry hand up and down  you
are he  you are he 


antonio

at a word  i am not 


ursula

come  come  do you think i do not know you by your
excellent wit  can virtue hide itself  go to 
mum  you are he  graces will appear  and there an
end 


beatrice

will you not tell me who told you so 


benedick

no  you shall pardon me 


beatrice

nor will you not tell me who you are 


benedick

not now 


beatrice

that i was disdainful  and that i had my good wit
out of the  merry tales well this was
signior benedick that said so 


benedick

what he 


beatrice

i am sure you know him well enough 


benedick

not i  believe me 


beatrice

did he never make you laugh 


benedick

i pray you  what is he 


beatrice

why  he is the prince jester  a very dull fool 
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders 
none but libertines delight in him  and the
commendation is not in his wit  but in his villany 
for he both pleases men and angers them  and then
they laugh at him and beat him  i am sure he is in
the fleet  i would he had boarded me 


benedick

when i know the gentleman  i tell him what you say 


beatrice

do  do  he but break a comparison or two on me 
which  peradventure not marked or not laughed at 
strikes him into melancholy  and then there a
partridge wing saved  for the fool will eat no
supper that night 
music
we must follow the leaders 


benedick

in every good thing 


beatrice

nay  if they lead to any ill  i will leave them at
the next turning 
dance  then exeunt all except don john  borachio  and claudio


don john

sure my brother is amorous on hero and hath
withdrawn her father to break with him about it 
the ladies follow her and but one visor remains 


borachio

and that is claudio  i know him by his bearing 


don john

are not you signior benedick 


claudio

you know me well  i am he 


don john

signior  you are very near my brother in his love 
he is enamoured on hero  i pray you  dissuade him
from her  she is no equal for his birth  you may
do the part of an honest man in it 


claudio

how know you he loves her 


don john

i heard him swear his affection 


borachio

so did i too  and he swore he would marry her to night 


don john

come  let us to the banquet 
exeunt don john and borachio


claudio

thus answer i in the name of benedick 
but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio 
 certain so  the prince wooes for himself 
friendship is constant in all other things
save in the office and affairs of love 
therefore  all hearts in love use their own tongues 
let every eye negotiate for itself
and trust no agent  for beauty is a witch
against whose charms faith melteth into blood 
this is an accident of hourly proof 
which i mistrusted not  farewell  therefore  hero 
re enter benedick


benedick

count claudio 


claudio

yea  the same 


benedick

come  will you go with me 


claudio

whither 


benedick

even to the next willow  about your own business 
county  what fashion will you wear the garland of 
about your neck  like an usurer chain  or under
your arm  like a lieutenant scarf  you must wear
it one way  for the prince hath got your hero 


claudio

i wish him joy of her 


benedick

why  that spoken like an honest drovier  so they
sell bullocks  but did you think the prince would
have served you thus 


claudio

i pray you  leave me 


benedick

ho  now you strike like the blind man   the
boy that stole your meat  and you beat the post 


claudio

if it will not be  i leave you 
exit


benedick

alas  poor hurt fowl  now will he creep into sedges 
but that my lady beatrice should know me  and not
know me  the prince fool  ha  it may be i go
under that title because i am merry  yea  but so i
am apt to do myself wrong  i am not so reputed  it
is the base  though bitter  disposition of beatrice
that puts the world into her person and so gives me
out  well  i be revenged as i may 
re enter don pedro


don pedro

now  signior  where the count  did you see him 


benedick

troth  my lord  i have played the part of lady fame 
i found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
warren  i told him  and i think i told him true 
that your grace had got the good will of this young
lady  and i offered him my company to a willow tree 
either to make him a garland  as being forsaken  or
to bind him up a rod  as being worthy to be whipped 


don pedro

to be whipped  what his fault 


benedick

the flat transgression of a schoolboy  who  being
overjoyed with finding a birds  nest  shows it his
companion  and he steals it 


don pedro

wilt thou make a trust a transgression  the
transgression is in the stealer 


benedick

yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made 
and the garland too  for the garland he might have
worn himself  and the rod he might have bestowed on
you  who  as i take it  have stolen his birds  nest 


don pedro

i will but teach them to sing  and restore them to
the owner 


benedick

if their singing answer your saying  by my faith 
you say honestly 


don pedro

the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you  the
gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
wronged by you 


benedick

o  she misused me past the endurance of a block 
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
answered her  my very visor began to assume life and
scold with her  she told me  not thinking i had been
myself  that i was the prince jester  that i was
duller than a great thaw  huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that i stood
like a man at a mark  with a whole army shooting at
me  she speaks poniards  and every word stabs 
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations 
there were no living near her  she would infect to
the north star  i would not marry her  though she
were endowed with all that adam bad left him before
he transgressed  she would have made hercules have
turned spit  yea  and have cleft his club to make
the fire too  come  talk not of her  you shall find
her the infernal ate in good apparel  i would to god
some scholar would conjure her  for certainly  while
she is here  a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
sanctuary  and people sin upon purpose  because they
would go thither  so  indeed  all disquiet  horror
and perturbation follows her 


don pedro

look  here she comes 
enter claudio  beatrice  hero  and leonato


benedick

will your grace command me any service to the
world end  i will go on the slightest errand now
to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on 
i will fetch you a tooth picker now from the
furthest inch of asia  bring you the length of
prester john foot  fetch you a hair off the great
cham beard  do you any embassage to the pigmies 
rather than hold three words  conference with this
harpy  you have no employment for me 


don pedro

none  but to desire your good company 


benedick

o god  sir  here a dish i love not  i cannot
endure my lady tongue 
exit


don pedro

come  lady  come  you have lost the heart of
signior benedick 


beatrice

indeed  my lord  he lent it me awhile  and i gave
him use for it  a double heart for his single one 
marry  once before he won it of me with false dice 
therefore your grace may well say i have lost it 


don pedro

you have put him down  lady  you have put him down 


beatrice

so i would not he should do me  my lord  lest i
should prove the mother of fools  i have brought
count claudio  whom you sent me to seek 


don pedro

why  how now  count  wherefore are you sad 


claudio

not sad  my lord 


don pedro

how then  sick 


claudio

neither  my lord 


beatrice

the count is neither sad  nor sick  nor merry  nor
well  but civil count  civil as an orange  and
something of that jealous complexion 


don pedro

i  faith  lady  i think your blazon to be true 
though  i be sworn  if he be so  his conceit is
false  here  claudio  i have wooed in thy name  and
fair hero is won  i have broke with her father 
and his good will obtained  name the day of
marriage  and god give thee joy 


leonato

count  take of me my daughter  and with her my
fortunes  his grace hath made the match  and an
grace say amen to it 


beatrice

speak  count   your cue 


claudio

silence is the perfectest herald of joy  i were
but little happy  if i could say how much  lady  as
you are mine  i am yours  i give away myself for
you and dote upon the exchange 


beatrice

speak  cousin  or  if you cannot  stop his mouth
with a kiss  and let not him speak neither 


don pedro

in faith  lady  you have a merry heart 


beatrice

yea  my lord  i thank it  poor fool  it keeps on
the windy side of care  my cousin tells him in his
ear that he is in her heart 


claudio

and so she doth  cousin 


beatrice

good lord  for alliance  thus goes every one to the
world but i  and i am sunburnt  i may sit in a
corner and cry heigh ho for a husband 


don pedro

lady beatrice  i will get you one 


beatrice

i would rather have one of your father getting 
hath your grace ne a brother like you  your
father got excellent husbands  if a maid could come by them 


don pedro

will you have me  lady 


beatrice

no  my lord  unless i might have another for
working days  your grace is too costly to wear
every day  but  i beseech your grace  pardon me  i
was born to speak all mirth and no matter 


don pedro

your silence most offends me  and to be merry best
becomes you  for  out of question  you were born in
a merry hour 


beatrice

no  sure  my lord  my mother cried  but then there
was a star danced  and under that was i born 
cousins  god give you joy 


leonato

niece  will you look to those things i told you of 


beatrice

i cry you mercy  uncle  by your grace pardon 
exit


don pedro

by my troth  a pleasant spirited lady 


leonato

there little of the melancholy element in her  my
lord  she is never sad but when she sleeps  and
not ever sad then  for i have heard my daughter say 
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
herself with laughing 


don pedro

she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband 


leonato

o  by no means  she mocks all her wooers out of suit 


don pedro

she were an excellent wife for benedict 


leonato

o lord  my lord  if they were but a week married 
they would talk themselves mad 


don pedro

county claudio  when mean you to go to church 


claudio

to morrow  my lord  time goes on crutches till love
have all his rites 


leonato

not till monday  my dear son  which is hence a just
seven night  and a time too brief  too  to have all
things answer my mind 


don pedro

come  you shake the head at so long a breathing 
but  i warrant thee  claudio  the time shall not go
dully by us  i will in the interim undertake one of
hercules  labours  which is  to bring signior
benedick and the lady beatrice into a mountain of
affection the one with the other  i would fain have
it a match  and i doubt not but to fashion it  if
you three will but minister such assistance as i
shall give you direction 


leonato

my lord  i am for you  though it cost me ten
nights  watchings 


claudio

and i  my lord 


don pedro

and you too  gentle hero 


hero

i will do any modest office  my lord  to help my
cousin to a good husband 


don pedro

and benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
i know  thus far can i praise him  he is of a noble
strain  of approved valour and confirmed honesty  i
will teach you how to humour your cousin  that she
shall fall in love with benedick  and i  with your
two helps  will so practise on benedick that  in
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach  he
shall fall in love with beatrice  if we can do this 
cupid is no longer an archer  hi s glory shall be
ours  for we are the only love gods  go in with me 
and i will tell you my drift
