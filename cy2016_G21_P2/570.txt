scene iii  a street 


enter dogberry and verges with the watch


dogberry

are you good men and true 


verges

yea  or else it were pity but they should suffer
salvation  body and soul 


dogberry

nay  that were a punishment too good for them  if
they should have any allegiance in them  being
chosen for the prince watch 


verges

well  give them their charge  neighbour dogberry 


dogberry

first  who think you the most desertless man to be
constable 


first watchman

hugh otecake  sir  or george seacole  for they can
write and read 


dogberry

come hither  neighbour seacole  god hath blessed
you with a good name  to be a well favoured man is
the gift of fortune  but to write and read comes by nature 


second watchman

both which  master constable 


dogberry

you have  i knew it would be your answer  well 
for your favour  sir  why  give god thanks  and make
no boast of it  and for your writing and reading 
let that appear when there is no need of such
vanity  you are thought here to be the most
senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch  therefore bear you the lantern  this is your
charge  you shall comprehend all vagrom men  you are
to bid any man stand  in the prince name 


second watchman

how if a  will not stand 


dogberry

why  then  take no note of him  but let him go  and
presently call the rest of the watch together and
thank god you are rid of a knave 


verges

if he will not stand when he is bidden  he is none
of the prince subjects 


dogberry

true  and they are to meddle with none but the
prince subjects  you shall also make no noise in
the streets  for  for the watch to babble and to
talk is most tolerable and not to be endured 


watchman

we will rather sleep than talk  we know what
belongs to a watch 


dogberry

why  you speak like an ancient and most quiet
watchman  for i cannot see how sleeping should
offend  only  have a care that your bills be not
stolen  well  you are to call at all the
ale houses  and bid those that are drunk get them to bed 


watchman

how if they will not 


dogberry

why  then  let them alone till they are sober  if
they make you not then the better answer  you may
say they are not the men you took them for 


watchman

well  sir 


dogberry

if you meet a thief  you may suspect him  by virtue
of your office  to be no true man  and  for such
kind of men  the less you meddle or make with them 
why the more is for your honesty 


watchman

if we know him to be a thief  shall we not lay
hands on him 


dogberry

truly  by your office  you may  but i think they
that touch pitch will be defiled  the most peaceable
way for you  if you do take a thief  is to let him
show himself what he is and steal out of your company 


verges

you have been always called a merciful man  partner 


dogberry

truly  i would not hang a dog by my will  much more
a man who hath any honesty in him 


verges

if you hear a child cry in the night  you must call
to the nurse and bid her still it 


watchman

how if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us 


dogberry

why  then  depart in peace  and let the child wake
her with crying  for the ewe that will not hear her
lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats 


verges

 very true 


dogberry

this is the end of the charge you  constable  are
to present the prince own person  if you meet the
prince in the night  you may stay him 


verges

nay  by our lady  that i think a  cannot 


dogberry

five shillings to one on t  with any man that knows
the statutes  he may stay him  marry  not without
the prince be willing  for  indeed  the watch ought
to offend no man  and it is an offence to stay a
man against his will 


verges

by lady  i think it be so 


dogberry

ha  ha  ha  well  masters  good night  an there be
any matter of weight chances  call up me  keep your
fellows  counsels and your own  and good night 
come  neighbour 


watchman

well  masters  we hear our charge  let us go sit here
upon the church bench till two  and then all to bed 


dogberry

one word more  honest neighbours  i pray you watch
about signior leonato door  for the wedding being
there to morrow  there is a great coil to night 
adieu  be vigitant  i beseech you 
exeunt dogberry and verges
enter borachio and conrade


borachio

what conrade 


watchman

 aside   peace  stir not 


borachio

conrade  i say 


conrade

here  man  i am at thy elbow 


borachio

mass  and my elbow itched  i thought there would a
scab follow 


conrade

i will owe thee an answer for that  and now forward
with thy tale 


borachio

stand thee close  then  under this pent house  for
it drizzles rain  and i will  like a true drunkard 
utter all to thee 


watchman

 aside   some treason  masters  yet stand close 


borachio

therefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats 


conrade

is it possible that any villany should be so dear 


borachio

thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
villany should be so rich  for when rich villains
have need of poor ones  poor ones may make what
price they will 


conrade

i wonder at it 


borachio

that shows thou art unconfirmed  thou knowest that
the fashion of a doublet  or a hat  or a cloak  is
nothing to a man 


conrade

yes  it is apparel 


borachio

i mean  the fashion 


conrade

yes  the fashion is the fashion 


borachio

tush  i may as well say the fool the fool  but
seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
is 


watchman

 aside   i know that deformed  a  has been a vile
thief this seven year  a  goes up and down like a
gentleman  i remember his name 


borachio

didst thou not hear somebody 


conrade

no   the vane on the house 


borachio

seest thou not  i say  what a deformed thief this
fashion is  how giddily a  turns about all the hot
bloods between fourteen and five and thirty 
sometimes fashioning them like pharaoh soldiers
in the reeky painting  sometime like god bel 
priests in the old church window  sometime like the
shaven hercules in the smirched worm eaten tapestry 
where his codpiece seems as massy as his club 


conrade

all this i see  and i see that the fashion wears
out more apparel than the man  but art not thou
thyself giddy with the fashion too  that thou hast
shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion 


borachio

not so  neither  but know that i have to night
wooed margaret  the lady hero gentlewoman  by the
name of hero  she leans me out at her mistress 
chamber window  bids me a thousand times good
night i tell this tale vilely i should first
tell thee how the prince  claudio and my master 
planted and placed and possessed by my master don
john  saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter 


conrade

and thought they margaret was hero 


borachio

two of them did  the prince and claudio  but the
devil my master knew she was margaret  and partly
by his oaths  which first possessed them  partly by
the dark night  which did deceive them  but chiefly
by my villany  which did confirm any slander that
don john had made  away went claudio enraged  swore
he would meet her  as he was appointed  next morning
at the temple  and there  before the whole
congregation  shame her with what he saw o night
and send her home again without a husband 


first watchman

we charge you  in the prince name  stand 


second watchman

call up the right master constable  we have here
recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
ever was known in the commonwealth 


first watchman

and one deformed is one of them  i know him  a 
wears a lock 


conrade

masters  masters 


second watchman

you be made bring deformed forth  i warrant you 


conrade

masters 


first watchman

never speak  we charge you let us obey you to go with us 


borachio

we are like to prove a goodly commodity  being taken
up of these men bills 


conrade

a commodity in question  i warrant you  come  we obey you 
exeunt
