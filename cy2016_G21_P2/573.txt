scene i  a church 


enter don pedro  don john  leonato  friar francis  claudio  benedick  hero  beatrice  and attendants


leonato

come  friar francis  be brief  only to the plain
form of marriage  and you shall recount their
particular duties afterwards 


friar francis

you come hither  my lord  to marry this lady 


claudio

no 


leonato

to be married to her  friar  you come to marry her 


friar francis

lady  you come hither to be married to this count 


hero

i do 


friar francis

if either of you know any inward impediment why you
should not be conjoined  charge you  on your souls 
to utter it 


claudio

know you any  hero 


hero

none  my lord 


friar francis

know you any  count 


leonato

i dare make his answer  none 


claudio

o  what men dare do  what men may do  what men daily
do  not knowing what they do 


benedick

how now  interjections  why  then  some be of
laughing  as  ah  ha  he 


claudio

stand thee by  friar  father  by your leave 
will you with free and unconstrained soul
give me this maid  your daughter 


leonato

as freely  son  as god did give her me 


claudio

and what have i to give you back  whose worth
may counterpoise this rich and precious gift 


don pedro

nothing  unless you render her again 


claudio

sweet prince  you learn me noble thankfulness 
there  leonato  take her back again 
give not this rotten orange to your friend 
she but the sign and semblance of her honour 
behold how like a maid she blushes here 
o  what authority and show of truth
can cunning sin cover itself withal 
comes not that blood as modest evidence
to witness simple virtue  would you not swear 
all you that see her  that she were a maid 
by these exterior shows  but she is none 
she knows the heat of a luxurious bed 
her blush is guiltiness  not modesty 


leonato

what do you mean  my lord 


claudio

not to be married 
not to knit my soul to an approved wanton 


leonato

dear my lord  if you  in your own proof 
have vanquish the resistance of her youth 
and made defeat of her virginity 


claudio

i know what you would say  if i have known her 
you will say she did embrace me as a husband 
and so extenuate the  sin 
no  leonato 
i never tempted her with word too large 
but  as a brother to his sister  show 
bashful sincerity and comely love 


hero

and seem i ever otherwise to you 


claudio

out on thee  seeming  i will write against it 
you seem to me as dian in her orb 
as chaste as is the bud ere it be blown 
but you are more intemperate in your blood
than venus  or those pamper animals
that rage in savage sensuality 


hero

is my lord well  that he doth speak so wide 


leonato

sweet prince  why speak not you 


don pedro

what should i speak 
i stand dishonour d  that have gone about
to link my dear friend to a common stale 


leonato

are these things spoken  or do i but dream 


don john

sir  they are spoken  and these things are true 


benedick

this looks not like a nuptial 


hero

true  o god 


claudio

leonato  stand i here 
is this the prince  is this the prince brother 
is this face hero s  are our eyes our own 


leonato

all this is so  but what of this  my lord 


claudio

let me but move one question to your daughter 
and  by that fatherly and kindly power
that you have in her  bid her answer truly 


leonato

i charge thee do so  as thou art my child 


hero

o  god defend me  how am i beset 
what kind of catechising call you this 


claudio

to make you answer truly to your name 


hero

is it not hero  who can blot that name
with any just reproach 


claudio

marry  that can hero 
hero itself can blot out hero virtue 
what man was he talk with you yesternight
out at your window betwixt twelve and one 
now  if you are a maid  answer to this 


hero

i talk with no man at that hour  my lord 


don pedro

why  then are you no maiden  leonato 
i am sorry you must hear  upon mine honour 
myself  my brother and this grieved count
did see her  hear her  at that hour last night
talk with a ruffian at her chamber window
who hath indeed  most like a liberal villain 
confess the vile encounters they have had
a thousand times in secret 


don john

fie  fie  they are not to be named  my lord 
not to be spoke of 
there is not chastity enough in language
without offence to utter them  thus  pretty lady 
i am sorry for thy much misgovernment 


claudio

o hero  what a hero hadst thou been 
if half thy outward graces had been placed
about thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart 
but fare thee well  most foul  most fair  farewell 
thou pure impiety and impious purity 
for thee i lock up all the gates of love 
and on my eyelids shall conjecture hang 
to turn all beauty into thoughts of harm 
and never shall it more be gracious 


leonato

hath no man dagger here a point for me 
hero swoons


beatrice

why  how now  cousin  wherefore sink you down 


don john

come  let us go  these things  come thus to light 
smother her spirits up 
exeunt don pedro  don john  and claudio


benedick

how doth the lady 


beatrice

                  dead  i think  help  uncle 
hero  why  hero  uncle  signior benedick  friar 


leonato

o fate  take not away thy heavy hand 
death is the fairest cover for her shame
that may be wish for 


beatrice

how now  cousin hero 


friar francis

have comfort  lady 


leonato

dost thou look up 


friar francis

yea  wherefore should she not 


leonato

wherefore  why  doth not every earthly thing
cry shame upon her  could she here deny
the story that is printed in her blood 
do not live  hero  do not ope thine eyes 
for  did i think thou wouldst not quickly die 
thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames 
myself would  on the rearward of reproaches 
strike at thy life  grieved i  i had but one 
chid i for that at frugal nature frame 
o  one too much by thee  why had i one 
why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes 
why had i not with charitable hand
took up a beggar issue at my gates 
who smirch thus and mired with infamy 
i might have said  part of it is mine 
this shame derives itself from unknown loins 
but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised
and mine that i was proud on  mine so much
that i myself was to myself not mine 
valuing of her why  she  o  she is fallen
into a pit of ink  that the wide sea
hath drops too few to wash her clean again
and salt too little which may season give
to her foul tainted flesh 


benedick

sir  sir  be patient 
for my part  i am so attired in wonder 
i know not what to say 


beatrice

o  on my soul  my cousin is belied 


benedick

lady  were you her bedfellow last night 


beatrice

no  truly not  although  until last night 
i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow 


leonato

confirm d  confirm d  o  that is stronger made
which was before barr up with ribs of iron 
would the two princes lie  and claudio lie 
who loved her so  that  speaking of her foulness 
wash it with tears  hence from her  let her die 


friar francis

hear me a little 
for i have only been silent so long
and given way unto this course of fortune 
 
by noting of the lady i have mark 
a thousand blushing apparitions
to start into her face  a thousand innocent shames
in angel whiteness beat away those blushes 
and in her eye there hath appear a fire 
to burn the errors that these princes hold
against her maiden truth  call me a fool 
trust not my reading nor my observations 
which with experimental seal doth warrant
the tenor of my book  trust not my age 
my reverence  calling  nor divinity 
if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
under some biting error 


leonato

friar  it cannot be 
thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
is that she will not add to her damnation
a sin of perjury  she not denies it 
why seek thou then to cover with excuse
that which appears in proper nakedness 


friar francis

lady  what man is he you are accused of 


hero

they know that do accuse me  i know none 
if i know more of any man alive
than that which maiden modesty doth warrant 
let all my sins lack mercy  o my father 
prove you that any man with me conversed
at hours unmeet  or that i yesternight
maintain the change of words with any creature 
refuse me  hate me  torture me to death 


friar francis

there is some strange misprision in the princes 


benedick

two of them have the very bent of honour 
and if their wisdoms be misled in this 
the practise of it lives in john the bastard 
whose spirits toil in frame of villanies 


leonato

i know not  if they speak but truth of her 
these hands shall tear her  if they wrong her honour 
the proudest of them shall well hear of it 
time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine 
nor age so eat up my invention 
nor fortune made such havoc of my means 
nor my bad life reft me so much of friends 
but they shall find  awaked in such a kind 
both strength of limb and policy of mind 
ability in means and choice of friends 
to quit me of them throughly 


friar francis

pause awhile 
and let my counsel sway you in this case 
your daughter here the princes left for dead 
let her awhile be secretly kept in 
and publish it that she is dead indeed 
maintain a mourning ostentation
and on your family old monument
hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
that appertain unto a burial 


leonato

what shall become of this  what will this do 


friar francis

marry  this well carried shall on her behalf
change slander to remorse  that is some good 
but not for that dream i on this strange course 
but on this travail look for greater birth 
she dying  as it must so be maintain d 
upon the instant that she was accused 
shall be lamented  pitied and excused
of every hearer  for it so falls out
that what we have we prize not to the worth
whiles we enjoy it  but being lack and lost 
why  then we rack the value  then we find
the virtue that possession would not show us
whiles it was ours  so will it fare with claudio 
when he shall hear she died upon his words 
the idea of her life shall sweetly creep
into his study of imagination 
and every lovely organ of her life
shall come apparell in more precious habit 
more moving delicate and full of life 
into the eye and prospect of his soul 
than when she lived indeed  then shall he mourn 
if ever love had interest in his liver 
and wish he had not so accused her 
no  though he thought his accusation true 
let this be so  and doubt not but success
will fashion the event in better shape
than i can lay it down in likelihood 
but if all aim but this be levell false 
the supposition of the lady death
will quench the wonder of her infamy 
and if it sort not well  you may conceal her 
as best befits her wounded reputation 
in some reclusive and religious life 
out of all eyes  tongues  minds and injuries 


benedick

signior leonato  let the friar advise you 
and though you know my inwardness and love
is very much unto the prince and claudio 
yet  by mine honour  i will deal in this
as secretly and justly as your soul
should with your body 


leonato

being that i flow in grief 
the smallest twine may lead me 


friar francis

 well consented  presently away 
for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure 
come  lady  die to live  this wedding day
perhaps is but prolong d  have patience and endure 
exeunt all but benedick and beatrice


benedick

lady beatrice  have you wept all this while 


beatrice

yea  and i will weep a while longer 


benedick

i will not desire that 


beatrice

you have no reason  i do it freely 


benedick

surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged 


beatrice

ah  how much might the man deserve of me that would right her 


benedick

is there any way to show such friendship 


beatrice

a very even way  but no such friend 


benedick

may a man do it 


beatrice

it is a man office  but not yours 


benedick

i do love nothing in the world so well as you  is
not that strange 


beatrice

as strange as the thing i know not  it were as
possible for me to say i loved nothing so well as
you  but believe me not  and yet i lie not  i
confess nothing  nor i deny nothing  i am sorry for my cousin 


benedick

by my sword  beatrice  thou lovest me 


beatrice

do not swear  and eat it 


benedick

i will swear by it that you love me  and i will make
him eat it that says i love not you 


beatrice

will you not eat your word 


benedick

with no sauce that can be devised to it  i protest
i love thee 


beatrice

why  then  god forgive me 


benedick

what offence  sweet beatrice 


beatrice

you have stayed me in a happy hour  i was about to
protest i loved you 


benedick

and do it with all thy heart 


beatrice

i love you with so much of my heart that none is
left to protest 


benedick

come  bid me do any thing for thee 


beatrice

kill claudio 


benedick

ha  not for the wide world 


beatrice

you kill me to deny it  farewell 


benedick

tarry  sweet beatrice 


beatrice

i am gone  though i am here  there is no love in
you  nay  i pray you  let me go 


benedick

beatrice 


beatrice

in faith  i will go 


benedick

we be friends first 


beatrice

you dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy 


benedick

is claudio thine enemy 


beatrice

is he not approved in the height a villain  that
hath slandered  scorned  dishonoured my kinswoman  o
that i were a man  what  bear her in hand until they
come to take hands  and then  with public
accusation  uncovered slander  unmitigated rancour 
 o god  that i were a man  i would eat his heart
in the market place 


benedick

hear me  beatrice 


beatrice

talk with a man out at a window  a proper saying 


benedick

nay  but  beatrice 


beatrice

sweet hero  she is wronged  she is slandered  she is undone 


benedick

beat 


beatrice

princes and counties  surely  a princely testimony 
a goodly count  count comfect  a sweet gallant 
surely  o that i were a man for his sake  or that i
had any friend would be a man for my sake  but
manhood is melted into courtesies  valour into
compliment  and men are only turned into tongue  and
trim ones too  he is now as valiant as hercules
that only tells a lie and swears it  i cannot be a
man with wishing  therefore i will die a woman with grieving 


benedick

tarry  good beatrice  by this hand  i love thee 


beatrice

use it for my love some other way than swearing by it 


benedick

think you in your soul the count claudio hath wronged hero 


beatrice

yea  as sure as i have a thought or a soul 


benedick

enough  i am engaged  i will challenge him  i will
kiss your hand  and so i leave you  by this hand 
claudio shall render me a dear account  as you
hear of me  so think of me  go  comfort your
cousin  i must say she is dead  and so  farewell 
exeunt
