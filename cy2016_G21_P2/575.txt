scene i  before leonato house 


enter leonato and antonio


antonio

if you go on thus  you will kill yourself 
and  not wisdom thus to second grief
against yourself 


leonato

                  i pray thee  cease thy counsel 
which falls into mine ears as profitless
as water in a sieve  give not me counsel 
nor let no comforter delight mine ear
but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine 
bring me a father that so loved his child 
whose joy of her is overwhelm like mine 
and bid him speak of patience 
measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
and let it answer every strain for strain 
as thus for thus and such a grief for such 
in every lineament  branch  shape  and form 
if such a one will smile and stroke his beard 
bid sorrow wag  cry  hem  when he should groan 
patch grief with proverbs  make misfortune drunk
with candle wasters  bring him yet to me 
and i of him will gather patience 
but there is no such man  for  brother  men
can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
which they themselves not feel  but  tasting it 
their counsel turns to passion  which before
would give preceptial medicine to rage 
fetter strong madness in a silken thread 
charm ache with air and agony with words 
no  no   all men office to speak patience
to those that wring under the load of sorrow 
but no man virtue nor sufficiency
to be so moral when he shall endure
the like himself  therefore give me no counsel 
my griefs cry louder than advertisement 


antonio

therein do men from children nothing differ 


leonato

i pray thee  peace  i will be flesh and blood 
for there was never yet philosopher
that could endure the toothache patiently 
however they have writ the style of gods
and made a push at chance and sufferance 


antonio

yet bend not all the harm upon yourself 
make those that do offend you suffer too 


leonato

there thou speak reason  nay  i will do so 
my soul doth tell me hero is belied 
and that shall claudio know  so shall the prince
and all of them that thus dishonour her 


antonio

here comes the prince and claudio hastily 
enter don pedro and claudio


don pedro

good den  good den 


claudio

good day to both of you 


leonato

don pedro

we have some haste  leonato 


leonato

some haste  my lord  well  fare you well  my lord 
are you so hasty now  well  all is one 


don pedro

nay  do not quarrel with us  good old man 


antonio

if he could right himself with quarreling 
some of us would lie low 


claudio

who wrongs him 


leonato

marry  thou dost wrong me  thou dissembler  thou 
nay  never lay thy hand upon thy sword 
i fear thee not 


claudio

                  marry  beshrew my hand 
if it should give your age such cause of fear 
in faith  my hand meant nothing to my sword 


leonato

tush  tush  man  never fleer and jest at me 
i speak not like a dotard nor a fool 
as under privilege of age to brag
what i have done being young  or what would do
were i not old  know  claudio  to thy head 
thou hast so wrong mine innocent child and me
that i am forced to lay my reverence by
and  with grey hairs and bruise of many days 
do challenge thee to trial of a man 
i say thou hast belied mine innocent child 
thy slander hath gone through and through her heart 
and she lies buried with her ancestors 
o  in a tomb where never scandal slept 
save this of hers  framed by thy villany 


claudio

my villany 


leonato

          thine  claudio  thine  i say 


don pedro

you say not right  old man 


leonato

my lord  my lord 
i prove it on his body  if he dare 
despite his nice fence and his active practise 
his may of youth and bloom of lustihood 


claudio

away  i will not have to do with you 


leonato

canst thou so daff me  thou hast kill my child 
if thou kill me  boy  thou shalt kill a man 


antonio

he shall kill two of us  and men indeed 
but that no matter  let him kill one first 
win me and wear me  let him answer me 
come  follow me  boy  come  sir boy  come  follow me 
sir boy  i whip you from your foining fence 
nay  as i am a gentleman  i will 


leonato

brother 


antonio

content yourself  god knows i loved my niece 
and she is dead  slander to death by villains 
that dare as well answer a man indeed
as i dare take a serpent by the tongue 
boys  apes  braggarts  jacks  milksops 


leonato

brother antony 


antonio

hold you content  what  man  i know them  yea 
and what they weigh  even to the utmost scruple 
scrambling  out facing  fashion monging boys 
that lie and cog and flout  deprave and slander 
go anticly  show outward hideousness 
and speak off half a dozen dangerous words 
how they might hurt their enemies  if they durst 
and this is all 


leonato

but  brother antony 


antonio

come   no matter 
do not you meddle  let me deal in this 


don pedro

gentlemen both  we will not wake your patience 
my heart is sorry for your daughter death 
but  on my honour  she was charged with nothing
but what was true and very full of proof 


leonato

my lord  my lord 


don pedro

i will not hear you 


leonato

no  come  brother  away  i will be heard

benedick

good day  my lord 


don pedro

welcome  signior  you are almost come to part
almost a fray 


claudio

we had like to have had our two noses snapped off
with two old men without teeth 


don pedro

leonato and his brother  what thinkest thou  had
we fought  i doubt we should have been too young for them 


benedick

in a false quarrel there is no true valour  i came
to seek you both 


claudio

we have been up and down to seek thee  for we are
high proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
away  wilt thou use thy wit 


benedick

it is in my scabbard  shall i draw it 


don pedro

dost thou wear thy wit by thy side 


claudio

never any did so  though very many have been beside
their wit  i will bid thee draw  as we do the
minstrels  draw  to pleasure us 


don pedro

as i am an honest man  he looks pale  art thou
sick  or angry 


claudio

what  courage  man  what though care killed a cat 
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care 


benedick

sir  i shall meet your wit in the career  and you
charge it against me  i pray you choose another subject 


claudio

nay  then  give him another staff  this last was
broke cross 


don pedro

by this light  he changes more and more  i think
he be angry indeed 


claudio

if he be  he knows how to turn his girdle 


benedick

shall i speak a word in your ear 


claudio

god bless me from a challenge 


benedick

 aside to claudio   you are a villain  i jest not 
i will make it good how you dare  with what you
dare  and when you dare  do me right  or i will
protest your cowardice  you have killed a sweet
lady  and her death shall fall heavy on you  let me
hear from you 


claudio

well  i will meet you  so i may have good cheer 


don pedro

what  a feast  a feast 


claudio

i  faith  i thank him  he hath bid me to a calf 
head and a capon  the which if i do not carve most
curiously  say my knife naught  shall i not find
a woodcock too 


benedick

sir  your wit ambles well  it goes easily 


don pedro

i tell thee how beatrice praised thy wit the
other day  i said  thou hadst a fine wit   true 
said she   fine little one   no  said i   
great wit   right  says she   great gross one 
 nay  said i   good wit   just  said she   
hurts nobody   nay  said i   gentleman
is wise   certain  said she   wise gentleman 
 nay  said i   hath the tongues   i
believe  said she   he swore a thing to me on
monday night  which he forswore on tuesday morning 
there a double tongue  there two tongues  thus
did she  an hour together  transshape thy particular
virtues  yet at last she concluded with a sigh  thou
wast the properest man in italy 


claudio

for the which she wept heartily and said she cared
not 


don pedro

yea  that she did  but yet  for all that  an if she
did not hate him deadly  she would love him dearly 
the old man daughter told us all 


claudio

all  all  and  moreover  god saw him when he was
hid in the garden 


don pedro

but when shall we set the savage bull horns on
the sensible benedick head 


claudio

yea  and text underneath   dwells benedick the
married man 


benedick

fare you well  boy  you know my mind  i will leave
you now to your gossip like humour  you break jests
as braggarts do their blades  which god be thanked 
hurt not  my lord  for your many courtesies i thank
you  i must discontinue your company  your brother
the bastard is fled from messina  you have among
you killed a sweet and innocent lady  for my lord
lackbeard there  he and i shall meet  and  till
then  peace be with him 
exit


don pedro

he is in earnest 


claudio

in most profound earnest  and  i warrant you  for
the love of beatrice 


don pedro

and hath challenged thee 


claudio

most sincerely 


don pedro

what a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
doublet and hose and leaves off his wit 


claudio

he is then a giant to an ape  but then is an ape a
doctor to such a man 


don pedro

but  soft you  let me be  pluck up  my heart  and
be sad  did he not say  my brother was fled 
enter dogberry  verges  and the watch  with conrade and borachio


dogberry

come you  sir  if justice cannot tame you  she
shall ne weigh more reasons in her balance  nay 
an you be a cursing hypocrite once  you must be looked to 


don pedro

how now  two of my brother men bound  borachio
one 


claudio

hearken after their offence  my lord 


don pedro

officers  what offence have these men done 


dogberry

marry  sir  they have committed false report 
moreover  they have spoken untruths  secondarily 
they are slanders  sixth and lastly  they have
belied a lady  thirdly  they have verified unjust
things  and  to conclude  they are lying knaves 


don pedro

first  i ask thee what they have done  thirdly  i
ask thee what their offence  sixth and lastly  why
they are committed  and  to conclude  what you lay
to their charge 


claudio

rightly reasoned  and in his own division  and  by
my troth  there one meaning well suited 


don pedro

who have you offended  masters  that you are thus
bound to your answer  this learned constable is
too cunning to be understood  what your offence 


borachio

sweet prince  let me go no farther to mine answer 
do you hear me  and let this count kill me  i have
deceived even your very eyes  what your wisdoms
could not discover  these shallow fools have brought
to light  who in the night overheard me confessing
to this man how don john your brother incensed me
to slander the lady hero  how you were brought into
the orchard and saw me court margaret in hero 
garments  how you disgraced her  when you should
marry her  my villany they have upon record  which
i had rather seal with my death than repeat over
to my shame  the lady is dead upon mine and my
master false accusation  and  briefly  i desire
nothing but the reward of a villain 


don pedro

runs not this speech like iron through your blood 


claudio

i have drunk poison whiles he utter it 


don pedro

but did my brother set thee on to this 


borachio

yea  and paid me richly for the practise of it 


don pedro

he is composed and framed of treachery 
and fled he is upon this villany 


claudio

sweet hero  now thy image doth appear
in the rare semblance that i loved it first 


dogberry

come  bring away the plaintiffs  by this time our
sexton hath reformed signior leonato of the matter 
and  masters  do not forget to specify  when time
and place shall serve  that i am an ass 


verges

here  here comes master signior leonato  and the
sexton too 
re enter leonato and antonio  with the sexton


leonato

which is the villain  let me see his eyes 
that  when i note another man like him 
i may avoid him  which of these is he 


borachio

if you would know your wronger  look on me 


leonato

art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill 
mine innocent child 


borachio

yea  even i alone 


leonato

no  not so  villain  thou beliest thyself 
here stand a pair of honourable men 
a third is fled  that had a hand in it 
i thank you  princes  for my daughter death 
record it with your high and worthy deeds 
 bravely done  if you bethink you of it 


claudio

i know not how to pray your patience 
yet i must speak  choose your revenge yourself 
impose me to what penance your invention
can lay upon my sin  yet sinn i not
but in mistaking 


don pedro

                  by my soul  nor i 
and yet  to satisfy this good old man 
i would bend under any heavy weight
that he enjoin me to 


leonato

i cannot bid you bid my daughter live 
that were impossible  but  i pray you both 
possess the people in messina here
how innocent she died  and if your love
can labour ought in sad invention 
hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
and sing it to her bones  sing it to night 
to morrow morning come you to my house 
and since you could not be my son in law 
be yet my nephew  my brother hath a daughter 
almost the copy of my child that dead 
and she alone is heir to both of us 
give her the right you should have given her cousin 
and so dies my revenge 


claudio

o noble sir 
your over kindness doth wring tears from me 
i do embrace your offer  and dispose
for henceforth of poor claudio 


leonato

to morrow then i will expect your coming 
to night i take my leave  this naughty man
shall face to face be brought to margaret 
who i believe was pack in all this wrong 
hired to it by your brother 


borachio

no  by my soul  she was not 
nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me 
but always hath been just and virtuous
in any thing that i do know by her 


dogberry

moreover  sir  which indeed is not under white and
black  this plaintiff here  the offender  did call
me ass  i beseech you  let it be remembered in his
punishment  and also  the watch heard them talk of
one deformed  they say be wears a key in his ear and
a lock hanging by it  and borrows money in god 
name  the which he hath used so long and never paid
that now men grow hard hearted and will lend nothing
for god sake  pray you  examine him upon that point 


leonato

i thank thee for thy care and honest pains 


dogberry

your worship speaks like a most thankful and
reverend youth  and i praise god for you 


leonato
