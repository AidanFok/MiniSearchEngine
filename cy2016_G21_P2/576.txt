scene ii  leonato garden 


enter benedick and margaret  meeting


benedick

pray thee  sweet mistress margaret  deserve well at
my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice 


margaret

will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty 


benedick

in so high a style  margaret  that no man living
shall come over it  for  in most comely truth  thou
deservest it 


margaret

to have no man come over me  why  shall i always
keep below stairs 


benedick

thy wit is as quick as the greyhound mouth  it catches 


margaret

and yours as blunt as the fencer foils  which hit 
but hurt not 


benedick

a most manly wit  margaret  it will not hurt a
woman  and so  i pray thee  call beatrice  i give
thee the bucklers 


margaret

give us the swords  we have bucklers of our own 


benedick

if you use them  margaret  you must put in the
pikes with a vice  and they are dangerous weapons for maids 


margaret

well  i will call beatrice to you  who i think hath legs 


benedick

and therefore will come 
exit margaret
sings
the god of love 
that sits above 
and knows me  and knows me 
how pitiful i deserve 
i mean in singing  but in loving  leander the good
swimmer  troilus the first employer of panders  and
a whole bookful of these quondam carpet mangers 
whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
blank verse  why  they were never so truly turned
over and over as my poor self in love  marry  i
cannot show it in rhyme  i have tried  i can find
out no rhyme to  lady  but  baby  an innocent
rhyme  for  scorn   horn  a hard rhyme  for 
 school   fool  a babbling rhyme  very ominous
endings  no  i was not born under a rhyming planet 
nor i cannot woo in festival terms 
enter beatrice
sweet beatrice  wouldst thou come when i called thee 


beatrice

yea  signior  and depart when you bid me 


benedick

o  stay but till then 


beatrice

 then  is spoken  fare you well now  and yet  ere
i go  let me go with that i came  which is  with
knowing what hath passed between you and claudio 


benedick

only foul words  and thereupon i will kiss thee 


beatrice

foul words is but foul wind  and foul wind is but
foul breath  and foul breath is noisome  therefore i
will depart unkissed 


benedick

thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense 
so forcible is thy wit  but i must tell thee
plainly  claudio undergoes my challenge  and either
i must shortly hear from him  or i will subscribe
him a coward  and  i pray thee now  tell me for
which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me 


beatrice

for them all together  which maintained so politic
a state of evil that they will not admit any good
part to intermingle with them  but for which of my
good parts did you first suffer love for me 


benedick

suffer love  a good epithet  i do suffer love
indeed  for i love thee against my will 


beatrice

in spite of your heart  i think  alas  poor heart 
if you spite it for my sake  i will spite it for
yours  for i will never love that which my friend hates 


benedick

thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably 


beatrice

it appears not in this confession  there not one
wise man among twenty that will praise himself 


benedick

an old  an old instance  beatrice  that lived in
the lime of good neighbours  if a man do not erect
in this age his own tomb ere he dies  he shall live
no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
widow weeps 


beatrice

and how long is that  think you 


benedick

question  why  an hour in clamour and a quarter in
rheum  therefore is it most expedient for the
wise  if don worm  his conscience  find no
impediment to the contrary  to be the trumpet of his
own virtues  as i am to myself  so much for
praising myself  who  i myself will bear witness  is
praiseworthy  and now tell me  how doth your cousin 


beatrice

very ill 


benedick

and how do you 


beatrice

very ill too 


benedick

serve god  love me and mend  there will i leave
you too  for here comes one in haste 
enter ursula


ursula

madam  you must come to your uncle  yonder old
coil at home  it is proved my lady hero hath been
falsely accused  the prince and claudio mightily
abused  and don john is the author of all  who is
fed and gone  will you come presently 


beatrice

will you go hear this news  signior 


benedick

i will live in thy heart  die in thy lap  and be
buried in thy eyes  and moreover i will go with
thee to thy uncle s
