scene iii  a church 


enter don pedro  claudio  and three or four with tapers


claudio

is this the monument of leonato 


lord

it is  my lord 


claudio

 reading out of a scroll 
done to death by slanderous tongues
was the hero that here lies 
death  in guerdon of her wrongs 
gives her fame which never dies 
so the life that died with shame
lives in death with glorious fame 
hang thou there upon the tomb 
praising her when i am dumb 
now  music  sound  and sing your solemn hymn 
song 
pardon  goddess of the night 
those that slew thy virgin knight 
for the which  with songs of woe 
round about her tomb they go 
midnight  assist our moan 
help us to sigh and groan 
heavily  heavily 
graves  yawn and yield your dead 
till death be uttered 
heavily  heavily 


claudio

     now  unto thy bones good night 
yearly will i do this rite 


don pedro

good morrow  masters  put your torches out 
the wolves have prey d  and look  the gentle day 
before the wheels of phoebus  round about
dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey 
thanks to you all  and leave us  fare you well 


claudio

     good morrow  masters  each his several way 


don pedro

come  let us hence  and put on other weeds 
and then to leonato we will go 


claudio

and hymen now with luckier issue speed 
than this for whom we render up this woe 
exeunt
