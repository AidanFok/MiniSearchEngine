scene i  venice  a street 


enter roderigo and iago


roderigo

tush  never tell me  i take it much unkindly
that thou  iago  who hast had my purse
as if the strings were thine  shouldst know of this 


iago

 sblood  but you will not hear me 
if ever i did dream of such a matter  abhor me 


roderigo

thou told me thou didst hold him in thy hate 


iago

despise me  if i do not  three great ones of the city 
in personal suit to make me his lieutenant 
off capp to him  and  by the faith of man 
i know my price  i am worth no worse a place 
but he  as loving his own pride and purposes 
evades them  with a bombast circumstance
horribly stuff with epithets of war 
and  in conclusion 
nonsuits my mediators  for   certes  says he 
 have already chose my officer 
and what was he 
forsooth  a great arithmetician 
one michael cassio  a florentine 
a fellow almost damn in a fair wife 
that never set a squadron in the field 
nor the division of a battle knows
more than a spinster  unless the bookish theoric 
wherein the toged consuls can propose
as masterly as he  mere prattle  without practise 
is all his soldiership  but he  sir  had the election 
and i  of whom his eyes had seen the proof
at rhodes  at cyprus and on other grounds
christian and heathen  must be be lee and calm 
by debitor and creditor  this counter caster 
he  in good time  must his lieutenant be 
and i god bless the mark his moorship ancient 


roderigo

by heaven  i rather would have been his hangman 


iago

why  there no remedy   the curse of service 
preferment goes by letter and affection 
and not by old gradation  where each second
stood heir to the first  now  sir  be judge yourself 
whether i in any just term am affined
to love the moor 


roderigo

i would not follow him then 


iago

o  sir  content you 
i follow him to serve my turn upon him 
we cannot all be masters  nor all masters
cannot be truly follow d  you shall mark
many a duteous and knee crooking knave 
that  doting on his own obsequious bondage 
wears out his time  much like his master ass 
for nought but provender  and when he old  cashier d 
whip me such honest knaves  others there are
who  trimm in forms and visages of duty 
keep yet their hearts attending on themselves 
and  throwing but shows of service on their lords 
do well thrive by them and when they have lined
their coats
do themselves homage  these fellows have some soul 
and such a one do i profess myself  for  sir 
it is as sure as you are roderigo 
were i the moor  i would not be iago 
in following him  i follow but myself 
heaven is my judge  not i for love and duty 
but seeming so  for my peculiar end 
for when my outward action doth demonstrate
the native act and figure of my heart
in compliment extern   not long after
but i will wear my heart upon my sleeve
for daws to peck at  i am not what i am 


roderigo

what a full fortune does the thicklips owe
if he can carry thus 


iago

call up her father 
rouse him  make after him  poison his delight 
proclaim him in the streets  incense her kinsmen 
and  though he in a fertile climate dwell 
plague him with flies  though that his joy be joy 
yet throw such changes of vexation on t 
as it may lose some colour 


roderigo

here is her father house  i call aloud 


iago

do  with like timorous accent and dire yell
as when  by night and negligence  the fire
is spied in populous cities 


roderigo

what  ho  brabantio  signior brabantio  ho 


iago

awake  what  ho  brabantio  thieves  thieves  thieves 
look to your house  your daughter and your bags 
thieves  thieves 
brabantio appears above  at a window


brabantio

what is the reason of this terrible summons 
what is the matter there 


roderigo

signior  is all your family within 


iago

are your doors lock d 


brabantio

why  wherefore ask you this 


iago

 zounds  sir  you robb d  for shame  put on
your gown 
your heart is burst  you have lost half your soul 
even now  now  very now  an old black ram
is topping your white ewe  arise  arise 
awake the snorting citizens with the bell 
or else the devil will make a grandsire of you 
arise  i say 


brabantio

                  what  have you lost your wits 


roderigo

most reverend signior  do you know my voice 


brabantio

not i	what are you 


roderigo

my name is roderigo 


brabantio

the worser welcome 
i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors 
in honest plainness thou hast heard me say
my daughter is not for thee  and now  in madness 
being full of supper and distempering draughts 
upon malicious bravery  dost thou come
to start my quiet 


roderigo

sir  sir  sir 


brabantio

                  but thou must needs be sure
my spirit and my place have in them power
to make this bitter to thee 


roderigo

patience  good sir 


brabantio

what tell thou me of robbing  this is venice 
my house is not a grange 


roderigo

most grave brabantio 
in simple and pure soul i come to you 


iago

 zounds  sir  you are one of those that will not
serve god  if the devil bid you  because we come to
do you service and you think we are ruffians  you 
have your daughter covered with a barbary horse 
you have your nephews neigh to you  you have
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans 


brabantio

what profane wretch art thou 


iago

i am one  sir  that comes to tell you your daughter
and the moor are now making the beast with two backs 


brabantio

thou art a villain 


iago

you are a senator 


brabantio

this thou shalt answer  i know thee  roderigo 


roderigo

sir  i will answer any thing  but  i beseech you 
if be your pleasure and most wise consent 
as partly i find it is  that your fair daughter 
at this odd even and dull watch o  the night 
transported  with no worse nor better guard
but with a knave of common hire  a gondolier 
to the gross clasps of a lascivious moor 
if this be known to you and your allowance 
we then have done you bold and saucy wrongs 
but if you know not this  my manners tell me
we have your wrong rebuke  do not believe
that  from the sense of all civility 
i thus would play and trifle with your reverence 
your daughter  if you have not given her leave 
i say again  hath made a gross revolt 
tying her duty  beauty  wit and fortunes
in an extravagant and wheeling stranger
of here and every where  straight satisfy yourself 
if she be in her chamber or your house 
let loose on me the justice of the state
for thus deluding you 


brabantio

strike on the tinder  ho 
give me a taper  call up all my people 
this accident is not unlike my dream 
belief of it oppresses me already 
light  i say  light 
exit above


iago

farewell  for i must leave you 
it seems not meet  nor wholesome to my place 
to be produced as  if i stay  i shall 
against the moor  for  i do know  the state 
however this may gall him with some cheque 
cannot with safety cast him  for he embark 
with such loud reason to the cyprus wars 
which even now stand in act  that  for their souls 
another of his fathom they have none 
to lead their business  in which regard 
though i do hate him as i do hell pains 
yet  for necessity of present life 
i must show out a flag and sign of love 
which is indeed but sign  that you shall surely find him 
lead to the sagittary the raised search 
and there will i be with him  so  farewell 
exit
enter  below  brabantio  and servants with torches


brabantio

it is too true an evil  gone she is 
and what to come of my despised time
is nought but bitterness  now  roderigo 
where didst thou see her  o unhappy girl 
with the moor  say thou  who would be a father 
how didst thou know  she  o she deceives me
past thought  what said she to you  get more tapers 
raise all my kindred  are they married  think you 


roderigo

truly  i think they are 


brabantio

o heaven  how got she out  o treason of the blood 
fathers  from hence trust not your daughters  minds
by what you see them act  is there not charms
by which the property of youth and maidhood
may be abused  have you not read  roderigo 
of some such thing 


roderigo

yes  sir  i have indeed 


brabantio

call up my brother  o  would you had had her 
some one way  some another  do you know
where we may apprehend her and the moor 


roderigo

i think i can discover him  if you please 
to get good guard and go along with me 


brabantio

pray you  lead on  at every house i call 
i may command at most  get weapons  ho 
and raise some special officers of night 
on  good roderigo  i deserve your pains 
exeunt
