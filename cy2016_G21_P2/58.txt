king henry iv

now  lords  if god doth give successful end
to this debate that bleedeth at our doors 
we will our youth lead on to higher fields
and draw no swords but what are sanctified 
our navy is address d  our power collected 
our substitutes in absence well invested 
and every thing lies level to our wish 
only  we want a little personal strength 
and pause us  till these rebels  now afoot 
come underneath the yoke of government 


warwick

both which we doubt not but your majesty
shall soon enjoy 


king henry iv

                  humphrey  my son of gloucester 
where is the prince your brother 


gloucester

i think he gone to hunt  my lord  at windsor 


king henry iv

and how accompanied 


gloucester

i do not know  my lord 


king henry iv

is not his brother  thomas of clarence  with him 


gloucester

no  my good lord  he is in presence here 


clarence

what would my lord and father 


king henry iv

nothing but well to thee  thomas of clarence 
how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother 
he loves thee  and thou dost neglect him  thomas 
thou hast a better place in his affection
than all thy brothers  cherish it  my boy 
and noble offices thou mayst effect
of mediation  after i am dead 
between his greatness and thy other brethren 
therefore omit him not  blunt not his love 
nor lose the good advantage of his grace
by seeming cold or careless of his will 
for he is gracious  if he be observed 
he hath a tear for pity and a hand
open as day for melting charity 
yet notwithstanding  being incensed  he flint 
as humorous as winter and as sudden
as flaws congealed in the spring of day 
his temper  therefore  must be well observed 
chide him for faults  and do it reverently 
when thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth 
but  being moody  give him line and scope 
till that his passions  like a whale on ground 
confound themselves with working  learn this  thomas 
and thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends 
a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in 
that the united vessel of their blood 
mingled with venom of suggestion 
as  force perforce  the age will pour it in 
shall never leak  though it do work as strong
as aconitum or rash gunpowder 


clarence

i shall observe him with all care and love 


king henry iv

why art thou not at windsor with him  thomas 


clarence

he is not there to day  he dines in london 


king henry iv

and how accompanied  canst thou tell that 


clarence

with poins  and other his continual followers 


king henry iv

most subject is the fattest soil to weeds 
and he  the noble image of my youth 
is overspread with them  therefore my grief
stretches itself beyond the hour of death 
the blood weeps from my heart when i do shape
in forms imaginary the unguided days
and rotten times that you shall look upon
when i am sleeping with my ancestors 
for when his headstrong riot hath no curb 
when rage and hot blood are his counsellors 
when means and lavish manners meet together 
o  with what wings shall his affections fly
towards fronting peril and opposed decay 


warwick

my gracious lord  you look beyond him quite 
the prince but studies his companions
like a strange tongue  wherein  to gain the language 
 needful that the most immodest word
be look upon and learn d  which once attain d 
your highness knows  comes to no further use
but to be known and hated  so  like gross terms 
the prince will in the perfectness of time
cast off his followers  and their memory
shall as a pattern or a measure live 
by which his grace must mete the lives of others 
turning past evils to advantages 


king henry iv

 seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
in the dead carrion 
enter westmoreland
who here  westmoreland 


westmoreland

health to my sovereign  and new happiness
added to that that i am to deliver 
prince john your son doth kiss your grace hand 
mowbray  the bishop scroop  hastings and all
are brought to the correction of your law 
there is not now a rebel sword unsheath 
but peace puts forth her olive every where 
the manner how this action hath been borne
here at more leisure may your highness read 
with every course in his particular 


king henry iv

o westmoreland  thou art a summer bird 
which ever in the haunch of winter sings
the lifting up of day 
enter harcourt
look  here more news 


harcourt

from enemies heaven keep your majesty 
and  when they stand against you  may they fall
as those that i am come to tell you of 
the earl northumberland and the lord bardolph 
with a great power of english and of scots
are by the sheriff of yorkshire overthrown 
the manner and true order of the fight
this packet  please it you  contains at large 


king henry iv

and wherefore should these good news make me sick 
will fortune never come with both hands full 
but write her fair words still in foulest letters 
she either gives a stomach and no food 
such are the poor  in health  or else a feast
and takes away the stomach  such are the rich 
that have abundance and enjoy it not 
i should rejoice now at this happy news 
and now my sight fails  and my brain is giddy 
o me  come near me  now i am much ill 


gloucester

comfort  your majesty 


clarence

o my royal father 


westmoreland

my sovereign lord  cheer up yourself  look up 


warwick

be patient  princes  you do know  these fits
are with his highness very ordinary 
stand from him  give him air  he straight be well 


clarence

no  no  he cannot long hold out these pangs 
the incessant care and labour of his mind
hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
so thin that life looks through and will break out 


gloucester

the people fear me  for they do observe
unfather heirs and loathly births of nature 
the seasons change their manners  as the year
had found some months asleep and leap them over 


clarence

the river hath thrice flow d  no ebb between 
and the old folk  time doting chronicles 
say it did so a little time before
that our great grandsire  edward  sick and died 


warwick

speak lower  princes  for the king recovers 


gloucester

this apoplexy will certain be his end 


king henry iv

i pray you  take me up  and bear me hence
into some other chamber  softly  pray
