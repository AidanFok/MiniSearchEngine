scene ii  another street 


enter othello  iago  and attendants with torches


iago

though in the trade of war i have slain men 
yet do i hold it very stuff o  the conscience
to do no contrived murder  i lack iniquity
sometimes to do me service  nine or ten times
i had thought to have yerk him here under the ribs 


othello

 better as it is 


iago

nay  but he prated 
and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
against your honour
that  with the little godliness i have 
i did full hard forbear him  but  i pray you  sir 
are you fast married  be assured of this 
that the magnifico is much beloved 
and hath in his effect a voice potential
as double as the duke s  he will divorce you 
or put upon you what restraint and grievance
the law  with all his might to enforce it on 
will give him cable 


othello

let him do his spite 
my services which i have done the signiory
shall out tongue his complaints   yet to know 
which  when i know that boasting is an honour 
i shall promulgate i fetch my life and being
from men of royal siege  and my demerits
may speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
as this that i have reach d  for know  iago 
but that i love the gentle desdemona 
i would not my unhoused free condition
put into circumscription and confine
for the sea worth  but  look  what lights come yond 


iago

those are the raised father and his friends 
you were best go in 


othello

not i	i must be found 
my parts  my title and my perfect soul
shall manifest me rightly  is it they 


iago

by janus  i think no 
enter cassio  and certain officers with torches


othello

the servants of the duke  and my lieutenant 
the goodness of the night upon you  friends 
what is the news 


cassio

                  the duke does greet you  general 
and he requires your haste post haste appearance 
even on the instant 


othello

what is the matter  think you 


cassio

something from cyprus as i may divine 
it is a business of some heat  the galleys
have sent a dozen sequent messengers
this very night at one another heels 
and many of the consuls  raised and met 
are at the duke already  you have been
hotly call for 
when  being not at your lodging to be found 
the senate hath sent about three several guests
to search you out 


othello

 well i am found by you 
i will but spend a word here in the house 
and go with you 
exit


cassio

                  ancient  what makes he here 


iago

 faith  he to night hath boarded a land carack 
if it prove lawful prize  he made for ever 


cassio

i do not understand 


iago

he married 


cassio

to who 
re enter othello


iago

marry  to come  captain  will you go 


othello

have with you 


cassio

here comes another troop to seek for you 


iago

it is brabantio  general  be advised 
he comes to bad intent 
enter brabantio  roderigo  and officers with torches and weapons


othello

holla  stand there 


roderigo

signior  it is the moor 


brabantio

down with him  thief 
they draw on both sides


iago

you  roderigo  come  sir  i am for you 


othello

keep up your bright swords  for the dew will rust them 
good signior  you shall more command with years
than with your weapons 


brabantio

o thou foul thief  where hast thou stow my daughter 
damn as thou art  thou hast enchanted her 
for i refer me to all things of sense 
if she in chains of magic were not bound 
whether a maid so tender  fair and happy 
so opposite to marriage that she shunned
the wealthy curled darlings of our nation 
would ever have  to incur a general mock 
run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
of such a thing as thou  to fear  not to delight 
judge me the world  if  not gross in sense
that thou hast practised on her with foul charms 
abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
that weaken motion  i have disputed on 
 probable and palpable to thinking 
i therefore apprehend and do attach thee
for an abuser of the world  a practiser
of arts inhibited and out of warrant 
lay hold upon him  if he do resist 
subdue him at his peril 


othello

hold your hands 
both you of my inclining  and the rest 
were it my cue to fight  i should have known it
without a prompter  where will you that i go
to answer this your charge 


brabantio

to prison  till fit time
of law and course of direct session
call thee to answer 


othello

what if i do obey 
how may the duke be therewith satisfied 
whose messengers are here about my side 
upon some present business of the state
to bring me to him 


first officer

 true  most worthy signior 
the duke in council and your noble self 
i am sure  is sent for 


brabantio

how  the duke in council 
in this time of the night  bring him away 
mine not an idle cause  the duke himself 
or any of my brothers of the state 
cannot but feel this wrong as  their own 
for if such actions may have passage free 
bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be 
exeunt
