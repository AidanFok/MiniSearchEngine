montano

what from the cape can you discern at sea 


first gentleman

nothing at all  it is a highwrought flood 
i cannot   the heaven and the main 
descry a sail 


montano

methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land 
a fuller blast ne shook our battlements 
if it hath ruffian so upon the sea 
what ribs of oak  when mountains melt on them 
can hold the mortise  what shall we hear of this 


second gentleman

a segregation of the turkish fleet 
for do but stand upon the foaming shore 
the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds 
the wind shaked surge  with high and monstrous mane 
seems to cast water on the burning bear 
and quench the guards of the ever fixed pole 
i never did like molestation view
on the enchafed flood 


montano

if that the turkish fleet
be not enshelter and embay d  they are drown d 
it is impossible they bear it out 
enter a third gentleman


third gentleman

news  lads  our wars are done

that their designment halts  a noble ship of venice
hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
on most part of their fleet 


montano

third gentleman

and is in full commission here for cyprus 


montano

i am glad on t   a worthy governor 


third gentleman

but this same cassio  though he speak of comfort
touching the turkish loss  yet he looks sadly 
and prays the moor be safe  for they were parted
with foul and violent tempest 


montano

pray heavens he be 
for i have served him  and the man commands
like a full soldier  let to the seaside  ho 
as well to see the vessel that come in
as to throw out our eyes for brave othello 
even till we make the main and the aerial blue
an indistinct regard 


third gentleman

come  let do so 
for every minute is expectancy
of more arrivance 
enter cassio


cassio

thanks  you the valiant of this warlike isle 
that so approve the moor  o  let the heavens
give him defence against the elements 
for i have lost us him on a dangerous sea 


montano

is he well shipp d 


cassio

his bark is stoutly timber d  his pilot
of very expert and approved allowance 
therefore my hopes  not surfeited to death 
stand in bold cure 
a cry within  sail  a sail  a sail 
enter a fourth gentleman


cassio

what noise 


fourth gentleman

the town is empty  on the brow o  the sea
stand ranks of people  and they cry  sail 


cassio

my hopes do shape him for the governor 
guns heard


second gentlemen

they do discharge their shot of courtesy 
our friends at least 


cassio

i pray you  sir  go forth 
and give us truth who  that is arrived 


second gentleman

i shall 
exit


montano

but  good lieutenant  is your general wived 


cassio

most fortunately  he hath achieved a maid
that paragons description and wild fame 
one that excels the quirks of blazoning pens 
and in the essential vesture of creation
does tire the ingener 
re enter second gentleman
how now  who has put in 


second gentleman

 one iago  ancient to the general 


cassio

has had most favourable and happy speed 
tempests themselves  high seas  and howling winds 
the gutter rocks and congregated sands 
traitors ensteep to clog the guiltless keel 
as having sense of beauty  do omit
their mortal natures  letting go safely by
the divine desdemona 


montano

what is she 


cassio

she that i spake of  our great captain captain 
left in the conduct of the bold iago 
whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
a se nnight speed  great jove  othello guard 
and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath 
that he may bless this bay with his tall ship 
make love quick pants in desdemona arms 
give renew fire to our extincted spirits
and bring all cyprus comfort 
enter desdemona  emilia  iago  roderigo  and attendants
o  behold 
the riches of the ship is come on shore 
ye men of cyprus  let her have your knees 
hail to thee  lady  and the grace of heaven 
before  behind thee  and on every hand 
enwheel thee round 


desdemona

i thank you  valiant cassio 
what tidings can you tell me of my lord 


cassio

he is not yet arrived  nor know i aught
but that he well and will be shortly here 


desdemona

o  but i fear how lost you company 


cassio

the great contention of the sea and skies
parted our fellowship but  hark  a sail 
within  sail  a sail  guns heard


second gentleman

they give their greeting to the citadel 
this likewise is a friend 


cassio

see for the news 
exit gentleman
good ancient  you are welcome 
to emilia
welcome  mistress 
let it not gall your patience  good iago 
that i extend my manners   my breeding
that gives me this bold show of courtesy 
kissing her


iago

sir  would she give you so much of her lips
as of her tongue she oft bestows on me 
you have enough 


desdemona

alas  she has no speech 


iago

in faith  too much 
i find it still  when i have list to sleep 
marry  before your ladyship  i grant 
she puts her tongue a little in her heart 
and chides with thinking 


emilia

you have little cause to say so 


iago

come on  come on  you are pictures out of doors 
bells in your parlors  wild cats in your kitchens 
saints m your injuries  devils being offended 
players in your housewifery  and housewives  in your beds 


desdemona

o  fie upon thee  slanderer 


iago

nay  it is true  or else i am a turk 
you rise to play and go to bed to work 


emilia

you shall not write my praise 


iago

no  let me not 


desdemona

what wouldst thou write of me  if thou shouldst
praise me 


iago

o gentle lady  do not put me to t 
for i am nothing  if not critical 


desdemona

come on assay  there one gone to the harbour 


iago

ay  madam 


desdemona

i am not merry  but i do beguile
the thing i am  by seeming otherwise 
come  how wouldst thou praise me 


iago

i am about it  but indeed my invention
comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize 
it plucks out brains and all  but my muse labours 
and thus she is deliver d 
if she be fair and wise  fairness and wit 
the one for use  the other useth it 


desdemona

well praised  how if she be black and witty 


iago

if she be black  and thereto have a wit 
she find a white that shall her blackness fit 


desdemona

worse and worse 


emilia

how if fair and foolish 


iago

she never yet was foolish that was fair 
for even her folly help her to an heir 


desdemona

these are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i 
the alehouse  what miserable praise hast thou for
her that foul and foolish 


iago

there none so foul and foolish thereunto 
but does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do 


desdemona

o heavy ignorance  thou praisest the worst best 
but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
woman indeed  one that  in the authority of her
merit  did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself 


iago

she that was ever fair and never proud 
had tongue at will and yet was never loud 
never lack gold and yet went never gay 
fled from her wish and yet said  i may 
she that being anger d  her revenge being nigh 
bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly 
she that in wisdom never was so frail
to change the cod head for the salmon tail 
she that could think and ne disclose her mind 
see suitors following and not look behind 
she was a wight  if ever such wight were 


desdemona

to do what 


iago

to suckle fools and chronicle small beer 


desdemona

o most lame and impotent conclusion  do not learn
of him  emilia  though he be thy husband  how say
you  cassio  is he not a most profane and liberal
counsellor 


cassio

he speaks home  madam  you may relish him more in
the soldier than in the scholar 


iago

 aside   he takes her by the palm  ay  well said 
whisper  with as little a web as this will i
ensnare as great a fly as cassio  ay  smile upon
her  do  i will gyve thee in thine own courtship 
you say true   so  indeed  if such tricks as
these strip you out of your lieutenantry  it had
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
oft  which now again you are most apt to play the
sir in  very good  well kissed  an excellent
courtesy   so  indeed  yet again your fingers
to your lips  would they were clyster pipes for your sake 
trumpet within
the moor  i know his trumpet 


cassio

 truly so 


desdemona

let meet him and receive him 


cassio

lo  where he comes 
enter othello and attendants


othello

o my fair warrior 


desdemona

                  my dear othello 


othello

it gives me wonder great as my content
to see you here before me  o my soul joy 
if after every tempest come such calms 
may the winds blow till they have waken death 
and let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
olympus high and duck again as low
as hell from heaven  if it were now to die 
 now to be most happy  for  i fear 
my soul hath her content so absolute
that not another comfort like to this
succeeds in unknown fate 


desdemona

the heavens forbid
but that our loves and comforts should increase 
even as our days do grow 


othello

amen to that  sweet powers 
i cannot speak enough of this content 
it stops me here  it is too much of joy 
and this  and this  the greatest discords be
kissing her
that e our hearts shall make 


iago

 aside   o  you are well tuned now 
but i set down the pegs that make this music 
as honest as i am 


othello

                  come  let us to the castle 
news  friends  our wars are done  the turks
are drown d 
how does my old acquaintance of this isle 
honey  you shall be well desired in cyprus 
i have found great love amongst them  o my sweet 
i prattle out of fashion  and i dote
in mine own comforts  i prithee  good iago 
go to the bay and disembark my coffers 
bring thou the master to the citadel 
he is a good one  and his worthiness
does challenge much respect  come  desdemona 
once more  well met at cyprus 
exeunt othello  desdemona  and attendants


iago

do thou meet me presently at the harbour  come
hither  if thou be valiant  as  they say  base
men being in love have then a nobility in their
natures more than is native to them list me  the
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
guard first  i must tell thee this desdemona is
directly in love with him 


roderigo

with him  why   not possible 


iago

lay thy finger thus  and let thy soul be instructed 
mark me with what violence she first loved the moor 
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies 
and will she love him still for prating  let not
thy discreet heart think it  her eye must be fed 
and what delight shall she have to look on the
devil  when the blood is made dull with the act of
sport  there should be  again to inflame it and to
give satiety a fresh appetite  loveliness in favour 
sympathy in years  manners and beauties  all which
the moor is defective in  now  for want of these
required conveniences  her delicate tenderness will
find itself abused  begin to heave the gorge 
disrelish and abhor the moor  very nature will
instruct her in it and compel her to some second
choice  now  sir  this granted as it is a most
pregnant and unforced position who stands so
eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio
does  a knave very voluble  no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
civil and humane seeming  for the better compassing
of his salt and most hidden loose affection  why 
none  why  none  a slipper and subtle knave  a
finder of occasions  that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages  though true advantage never
present itself  a devilish knave  besides  the
knave is handsome  young  and hath all those
requisites in him that folly and green minds look
after  a pestilent complete knave  and the woman
hath found him already 


roderigo

i cannot believe that in her  she full of
most blessed condition 


iago

blessed fig s end  the wine she drinks is made of
grapes  if she had been blessed  she would never
have loved the moor  blessed pudding  didst thou
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand  didst
not mark that 


roderigo

yes  that i did  but that was but courtesy 


iago

lechery  by this hand  an index and obscure prologue
to the history of lust and foul thoughts  they met
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
together  villanous thoughts  roderigo  when these
mutualities so marshal the way  hard at hand comes
the master and main exercise  the incorporate
conclusion  pish  but  sir  be you ruled by me  i
have brought you from venice  watch you to night 
for the command  i lay upon you  cassio knows
you not  i not be far from you  do you find
some occasion to anger cassio  either by speaking
too loud  or tainting his discipline  or from what
other course you please  which the time shall more
favourably minister 


roderigo

well 


iago

sir  he is rash and very sudden in choler  and haply
may strike at you  provoke him  that he may  for
even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to
mutiny  whose qualification shall come into no true
taste again but by the displanting of cassio  so
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
the means i shall then have to prefer them  and the
impediment most profitably removed  without the
which there were no expectation of our prosperity 


roderigo

i will do this  if i can bring it to any
opportunity 


iago

i warrant thee  meet me by and by at the citadel 
i must fetch his necessaries ashore  farewell 


roderigo

adieu 
exit


iago

that cassio loves her  i do well believe it 
that she loves him   apt and of great credit 
the moor  howbeit that i endure him not 
is of a constant  loving  noble nature 
and i dare think he prove to desdemona
a most dear husband  now  i do love her too 
not out of absolute lust  though peradventure
i stand accountant for as great a sin 
but partly led to diet my revenge 
for that i do suspect the lusty moor
hath leap into my seat  the thought whereof
doth  like a poisonous mineral  gnaw my inwards 
and nothing can or shall content my soul
till i am even with him  wife for wife 
or failing so  yet that i put the moor
at least into a jealousy so strong
that judgment cannot cure  which thing to do 
if this poor trash of venice  whom i trash
for his quick hunting  stand the putting on 
i have our michael cassio on the hip 
abuse him to the moor in the rank garb 
for i fear cassio with my night cap too 
make the moor thank me  love me and reward me 
for making him egregiously an ass
and practising upon his peace and quiet
even to madness   here  but yet confused 
knavery plain face is never seen tin used
