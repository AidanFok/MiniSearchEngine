othello

good michael  look you to the guard to night 
let teach ourselves that honourable stop 
not to outsport discretion 


cassio

iago hath direction what to do 
but  notwithstanding  with my personal eye
will i look to t 


othello

                  iago is most honest 
michael  good night  to morrow with your earliest
let me have speech with you 
to desdemona
come  my dear love 
the purchase made  the fruits are to ensue 
that profit yet to come  me and you 
good night 
exeunt othello  desdemona  and attendants
enter iago


cassio

welcome  iago  we must to the watch 


iago

not this hour  lieutenant   not yet ten o  the
clock  our general cast us thus early for the love
of his desdemona  who let us not therefore blame 
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her  and
she is sport for jove 


cassio

she a most exquisite lady 


iago

and  i warrant her  fun of game 


cassio

indeed  she a most fresh and delicate creature 


iago

what an eye she has  methinks it sounds a parley of
provocation 


cassio

an inviting eye  and yet methinks right modest 


iago

and when she speaks  is it not an alarum to love 


cassio

she is indeed perfection 


iago

well  happiness to their sheets  come  lieutenant  i
have a stoup of wine  and here without are a brace
of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
the health of black othello 


cassio

not to night  good iago  i have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking  i could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment 


iago

o  they are our friends  but one cup  i drink for
you 


cassio

i have drunk but one cup to night  and that was
craftily qualified too  and  behold  what innovation
it makes here  i am unfortunate in the infirmity 
and dare not task my weakness with any more 


iago

what  man   a night of revels  the gallants
desire it 


cassio

where are they 


iago

here at the door  i pray you  call them in 


cassio

i do t  but it dislikes me 
exit


iago

if i can fasten but one cup upon him 
with that which he hath drunk to night already 
he be as full of quarrel and offence
as my young mistress  dog  now  my sick fool roderigo 
whom love hath turn almost the wrong side out 
to desdemona hath to night caroused
potations pottle deep  and he to watch 
three lads of cyprus  noble swelling spirits 
that hold their honours in a wary distance 
the very elements of this warlike isle 
have i to night fluster with flowing cups 
and they watch too  now   this flock of drunkards 
am i to put our cassio in some action
that may offend the isle but here they come 
if consequence do but approve my dream 
my boat sails freely  both with wind and stream 
re enter cassio  with him montano and gentlemen  servants following with wine


cassio

 god  they have given me a rouse already 


montano

good faith  a little one  not past a pint  as i am
a soldier 


iago

some wine  ho 
sings
and let me the canakin clink  clink 
and let me the canakin clink
a soldier a man 
a life but a span 
why  then  let a soldier drink 
some wine  boys 


cassio

 god  an excellent song 


iago

i learned it in england  where  indeed  they are
most potent in potting  your dane  your german  and
your swag bellied hollander drink  ho are nothing
to your english 


cassio

is your englishman so expert in his drinking 


iago

why  he drinks you  with facility  your dane dead
drunk  he sweats not to overthrow your almain  he
gives your hollander a vomit  ere the next pottle
can be filled 


cassio

to the health of our general 


montano

i am for it  lieutenant  and i do you justice 


iago

o sweet england 
king stephen was a worthy peer 
his breeches cost him but a crown 
he held them sixpence all too dear 
with that he call the tailor lown 
he was a wight of high renown 
and thou art but of low degree 
 pride that pulls the country down 
then take thine auld cloak about thee 
some wine  ho 


cassio

why  this is a more exquisite song than the other 


iago

will you hear again 


cassio

no  for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that
does those things  well  god above all  and there
be souls must be saved  and there be souls must not be saved 


iago

it true  good lieutenant 


cassio

for mine own part no offence to the general  nor
any man of quality i hope to be saved 


iago

and so do i too  lieutenant 


cassio

ay  but  by your leave  not before me  the
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient  let 
have no more of this  let to our affairs forgive
us our sins gentlemen  let look to our business 
do not think  gentlemen  i am drunk  this is my
ancient  this is my right hand  and this is my left 
i am not drunk now  i can stand well enough  and
speak well enough 


all

excellent well 


cassio

why  very well then  you must not think then that i am drunk 
exit


montano

to the platform  masters  come  let set the watch 


iago

you see this fellow that is gone before 
he is a soldier fit to stand by caesar
and give direction  and do but see his vice 
 to his virtue a just equinox 
the one as long as the other   pity of him 
i fear the trust othello puts him in 
on some odd time of his infirmity 
will shake this island 


montano

but is he often thus 


iago

 evermore the prologue to his sleep 
he watch the horologe a double set 
if drink rock not his cradle 


montano

it were well
the general were put in mind of it 
perhaps he sees it not  or his good nature
prizes the virtue that appears in cassio 
and looks not on his evils  is not this true 
enter roderigo


iago

 aside to him   how now  roderigo 
i pray you  after the lieutenant  go 
exit roderigo


montano

and  great pity that the noble moor
should hazard such a place as his own second
with one of an ingraft infirmity 
it were an honest action to say
so to the moor 


iago

                  not i  for this fair island 
i do love cassio well  and would do much
to cure him of this evil but  hark  what noise 
cry within   help  help 
re enter cassio  driving in roderigo


cassio

you rogue  you rascal 


montano

what the matter  lieutenant 


cassio

a knave teach me my duty 
i beat the knave into a twiggen bottle 


roderigo

beat me 


cassio

       dost thou prate  rogue 
striking roderigo


montano

nay  good lieutenant 
staying him
i pray you  sir  hold your hand 


cassio

let me go  sir 
or i knock you o the mazzard 


montano

come  come 
you drunk 


cassio

drunk 
they fight


iago

 aside to roderigo   away  i say  go out  and cry a mutiny 
exit roderigo
nay  good lieutenant alas  gentlemen 
help  ho lieutenant sir montano sir 
help  masters here a goodly watch indeed 
bell rings
who that which rings the bell diablo  ho 
the town will rise  god will  lieutenant  hold 
you will be shamed for ever 
re enter othello and attendants


othello

what is the matter here 


montano

 zounds  i bleed still  i am hurt to the death 
faints


othello

hold  for your lives 


iago

hold  ho  lieutenant sir montano gentlemen 
have you forgot all sense of place and duty 
hold  the general speaks to you  hold  hold  for shame 


othello

why  how now  ho  from whence ariseth this 
are we turn turks  and to ourselves do that
which heaven hath forbid the ottomites 
for christian shame  put by this barbarous brawl 
he that stirs next to carve for his own rage
holds his soul light  he dies upon his motion 
silence that dreadful bell  it frights the isle
from her propriety  what is the matter  masters 
honest iago  that look dead with grieving 
speak  who began this  on thy love  i charge thee 


iago

i do not know  friends all but now  even now 
in quarter  and in terms like bride and groom
devesting them for bed  and then  but now 
as if some planet had unwitted men 
swords out  and tilting one at other breast 
in opposition bloody  i cannot speak
any beginning to this peevish odds 
and would in action glorious i had lost
those legs that brought me to a part of it 


othello

how comes it  michael  you are thus forgot 


cassio

i pray you  pardon me  i cannot speak 


othello

worthy montano  you were wont be civil 
the gravity and stillness of your youth
the world hath noted  and your name is great
in mouths of wisest censure  what the matter 
that you unlace your reputation thus
and spend your rich opinion for the name
of a night brawler  give me answer to it 


montano

worthy othello  i am hurt to danger 
your officer  iago  can inform you 
while i spare speech  which something now
offends me 
of all that i do know  nor know i aught
by me that said or done amiss this night 
unless self charity be sometimes a vice 
and to defend ourselves it be a sin
when violence assails us 


othello

now  by heaven 
my blood begins my safer guides to rule 
and passion  having my best judgment collied 
assays to lead the way  if i once stir 
or do but lift this arm  the best of you
shall sink in my rebuke  give me to know
how this foul rout began  who set it on 
and he that is approved in this offence 
though he had twinn with me  both at a birth 
shall lose me  what  in a town of war 
yet wild  the people hearts brimful of fear 
to manage private and domestic quarrel 
in night  and on the court and guard of safety 
 monstrous  iago  who began t 


montano

if partially affined  or leagued in office 
thou dost deliver more or less than truth 
thou art no soldier 


iago

touch me not so near 
i had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
than it should do offence to michael cassio 
yet  i persuade myself  to speak the truth
shall nothing wrong him  thus it is  general 
montano and myself being in speech 
there comes a fellow crying out for help 
and cassio following him with determined sword 
to execute upon him  sir  this gentleman
steps in to cassio  and entreats his pause 
myself the crying fellow did pursue 
lest by his clamour as it so fell out 
the town might fall in fright  he  swift of foot 
outran my purpose  and i return the rather
for that i heard the clink and fall of swords 
and cassio high in oath  which till to night
i ne might say before  when i came back 
for this was brief i found them close together 
at blow and thrust  even as again they were
when you yourself did part them 
more of this matter cannot i report 
but men are men  the best sometimes forget 
though cassio did some little wrong to him 
as men in rage strike those that wish them best 
yet surely cassio  i believe  received
from him that fled some strange indignity 
which patience could not pass 


othello

i know  iago 
thy honesty and love doth mince this matter 
making it light to cassio  cassio  i love thee
but never more be officer of mine 
re enter desdemona  attended
look  if my gentle love be not raised up 
i make thee an example 


desdemona

what the matter 


othello

all well now  sweeting  come away to bed 
sir  for your hurts  myself will be your surgeon 
lead him off 
to montano  who is led off
iago  look with care about the town 
and silence those whom this vile brawl distracted 
come  desdemona   the soldiers  life
to have their balmy slumbers waked with strife 
exeunt all but iago and cassio


iago

what  are you hurt  lieutenant 


cassio

ay  past all surgery 


iago

marry  heaven forbid 


cassio

reputation  reputation  reputation  o  i have lost
my reputation  i have lost the immortal part of
myself  and what remains is bestial  my reputation 
iago  my reputation 


iago

as i am an honest man  i thought you had received
some bodily wound  there is more sense in that than
in reputation  reputation is an idle and most false
imposition  oft got without merit  and lost without
deserving  you have lost no reputation at all 
unless you repute yourself such a loser  what  man 
there are ways to recover the general again  you
are but now cast in his mood  a punishment more in
policy than in malice  even so as one would beat his
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion  sue
to him again  and he yours 


cassio

i will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
good a commander with so slight  so drunken  and so
indiscreet an officer  drunk  and speak parrot 
and squabble  swagger  swear  and discourse
fustian with one own shadow  o thou invisible
spirit of wine  if thou hast no name to be known by 
let us call thee devil 


iago

what was he that you followed with your sword  what
had he done to you 


cassio

i know not 


iago

is possible 


cassio

i remember a mass of things  but nothing distinctly 
a quarrel  but nothing wherefore  o god  that men
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains  that we should  with joy  pleasance
revel and applause  transform ourselves into beasts 


iago

why  but you are now well enough  how came you thus
recovered 


cassio

it hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
to the devil wrath  one unperfectness shows me
another  to make me frankly despise myself 


iago

come  you are too severe a moraler  as the time 
the place  and the condition of this country
stands  i could heartily wish this had not befallen 
but  since it is as it is  mend it for your own good 


cassio

i will ask him for my place again  he shall tell me
i am a drunkard  had i as many mouths as hydra 
such an answer would stop them all  to be now a
sensible man  by and by a fool  and presently a
beast  o strange  every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil 


iago

come  come  good wine is a good familiar creature 
if it be well used  exclaim no more against it 
and  good lieutenant  i think you think i love you 


cassio

i have well approved it  sir  i drunk 


iago

you or any man living may be drunk  at a time  man 
i tell you what you shall do  our general wife
is now the general  may say so in this respect  for
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
contemplation  mark  and denotement of her parts and
graces  confess yourself freely to her  importune
her help to put you in your place again  she is of
so free  so kind  so apt  so blessed a disposition 
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
than she is requested  this broken joint between
you and her husband entreat her to splinter  and  my
fortunes against any lay worth naming  this
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before 


cassio

you advise me well 


iago

i protest  in the sincerity of love and honest kindness 


cassio

i think it freely  and betimes in the morning i will
beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me 
i am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here 


iago

you are in the right  good night  lieutenant  i
must to the watch 
cassio  good night  honest iago 
exit


iago

and what he then that says i play the villain 
when this advice is free i give and honest 
probal to thinking and indeed the course
to win the moor again  for  most easy
the inclining desdemona to subdue
in any honest suit  she framed as fruitful
as the free elements  and then for her
to win the moor were to renounce his baptism 
all seals and symbols of redeemed sin 
his soul is so enfetter to her love 
that she may make  unmake  do what she list 
even as her appetite shall play the god
with his weak function  how am i then a villain
to counsel cassio to this parallel course 
directly to his good  divinity of hell 
when devils will the blackest sins put on 
they do suggest at first with heavenly shows 
as i do now  for whiles this honest fool
plies desdemona to repair his fortunes
and she for him pleads strongly to the moor 
i pour this pestilence into his ear 
that she repeals him for her body lust 
and by how much she strives to do him good 
she shall undo her credit with the moor 
so will i turn her virtue into pitch 
and out of her own goodness make the net
that shall enmesh them all 
re enter roderigo
how now  roderigo 


roderigo

i do follow here in the chase  not like a hound that
hunts  but one that fills up the cry  my money is
almost spent  i have been to night exceedingly well
cudgelled  and i think the issue will be  i shall
have so much experience for my pains  and so  with
no money at all and a little more wit  return again to venice 


iago

how poor are they that have not patience 
what wound did ever heal but by degrees 
thou know we work by wit  and not by witchcraft 
and wit depends on dilatory time 
does not go well  cassio hath beaten thee 
and thou  by that small hurt  hast cashier cassio 
though other things grow fair against the sun 
yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe 
content thyself awhile  by the mass   morning 
pleasure and action make the hours seem short 
retire thee  go where thou art billeted 
away  i say  thou shalt know more hereafter 
nay  get thee gone 
exit roderigo
two things are to be done 
my wife must move for cassio to her mistress 
i set her on 
myself the while to draw the moor apart 
and bring him jump when he may cassio find
soliciting his wife  ay  that the way
dull not device by coldness and delay
