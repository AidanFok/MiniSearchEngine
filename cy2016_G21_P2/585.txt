good morrow  good lieutenant  i am sorry
for your displeasure  but all will sure be well 
the general and his wife are talking of it 
and she speaks for you stoutly  the moor replies 
that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus 
and great affinity  and that in wholesome wisdom
he might not but refuse you  but he protests he loves you
and needs no other suitor but his likings
to take the safest occasion by the front
to bring you in again 


cassio

yet  i beseech you 
if you think fit  or that it may be done 
give me advantage of some brief discourse
with desdemona alone 


emilia

pray you  come in 
i will bestow you where you shall have time
to speak your bosom freely 


cassio

i am much bound to you
