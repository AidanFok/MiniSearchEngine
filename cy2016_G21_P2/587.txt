enter desdemona  cassio  and emilia


desdemona

be thou assured  good cassio  i will do
all my abilities in thy behalf 


emilia

good madam  do  i warrant it grieves my husband 
as if the case were his 


desdemona

o  that an honest fellow  do not doubt  cassio 
but i will have my lord and you again
as friendly as you were 


cassio

bounteous madam 
whatever shall become of michael cassio 
he never any thing but your true servant 


desdemona

i know t  i thank you  you do love my lord 
you have known him long  and be you well assured
he shall in strangeness stand no further off
than in a polite distance 


cassio

ay  but  lady 
that policy may either last so long 
or feed upon such nice and waterish diet 
or breed itself so out of circumstance 
that  i being absent and my place supplied 
my general will forget my love and service 


desdemona

do not doubt that  before emilia here
i give thee warrant of thy place  assure thee 
if i do vow a friendship  i perform it
to the last article  my lord shall never rest 
i watch him tame and talk him out of patience 
his bed shall seem a school  his board a shrift 
i intermingle every thing he does
with cassio suit  therefore be merry  cassio 
for thy solicitor shall rather die
than give thy cause away 


emilia

madam  here comes my lord 


cassio

madam  i take my leave 


desdemona

why  stay  and hear me speak 


cassio

madam  not now  i am very ill at ease 
unfit for mine own purposes 


desdemona

well  do your discretion 
exit cassio
enter othello and iago


iago

ha  i like not that 


othello

what dost thou say 


iago

nothing  my lord  or if i know not what 


othello

was not that cassio parted from my wife 


iago

cassio  my lord  no  sure  i cannot think it 
that he would steal away so guilty like 
seeing you coming 


othello

                  i do believe  he 


desdemona

how now  my lord 
i have been talking with a suitor here 
a man that languishes in your displeasure 


othello

who is you mean 


desdemona

why  your lieutenant  cassio  good my lord 
if i have any grace or power to move you 
his present reconciliation take 
for if he be not one that truly loves you 
that errs in ignorance and not in cunning 
i have no judgment in an honest face 
i prithee  call him back 


othello

went he hence now 


desdemona

ay  sooth  so humbled
that he hath left part of his grief with me 
to suffer with him  good love  call him back 


othello

not now  sweet desdemona  some other time 


desdemona

but shall be shortly 


othello

the sooner  sweet  for you 


desdemona

shall be to night at supper 


othello

no  not to night 


desdemona

to morrow dinner  then 


othello

i shall not dine at home 
i meet the captains at the citadel 


desdemona

why  then  to morrow night  or tuesday morn 
on tuesday noon  or night  on wednesday morn 
i prithee  name the time  but let it not
exceed three days  in faith  he penitent 
and yet his trespass  in our common reason 
save that  they say  the wars must make examples
out of their best is not almost a fault
to incur a private cheque  when shall he come 
tell me  othello  i wonder in my soul 
what you would ask me  that i should deny 
or stand so mammering on  what  michael cassio 
that came a wooing with you  and so many a time 
when i have spoke of you dispraisingly 
hath ta your part  to have so much to do
to bring him in  trust me  i could do much 


othello

prithee  no more  let him come when he will 
i will deny thee nothing 


desdemona

why  this is not a boon 
 as i should entreat you wear your gloves 
or feed on nourishing dishes  or keep you warm 
or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
to your own person  nay  when i have a suit
wherein i mean to touch your love indeed 
it shall be full of poise and difficult weight
and fearful to be granted 


othello

i will deny thee nothing 
whereon  i do beseech thee  grant me this 
to leave me but a little to myself 


desdemona

shall i deny you  no  farewell  my lord 


othello

farewell  my desdemona  i come to thee straight 


desdemona

emilia  come  be as your fancies teach you 
whate you be  i am obedient 
exeunt desdemona and emilia


othello

excellent wretch  perdition catch my soul 
but i do love thee  and when i love thee not 
chaos is come again 


iago

my noble lord 


othello

                  what dost thou say  iago 


iago

did michael cassio  when you woo my lady 
know of your love 


othello

he did  from first to last  why dost thou ask 


iago

but for a satisfaction of my thought 
no further harm 


othello

                  why of thy thought  iago 


iago

i did not think he had been acquainted with her 


othello

o  yes  and went between us very oft 


iago

indeed 


othello

indeed  ay  indeed  discern thou aught in that 
is he not honest 


iago

honest  my lord 


othello

                  honest  ay  honest 


iago

my lord  for aught i know 


othello

what dost thou think 


iago

think  my lord 


othello

think  my lord 
by heaven  he echoes me 
as if there were some monster in his thought
too hideous to be shown  thou dost mean something 
i heard thee say even now  thou likedst not that 
when cassio left my wife  what didst not like 
and when i told thee he was of my counsel
in my whole course of wooing  thou criedst  indeed 
and didst contract and purse thy brow together 
as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
some horrible conceit  if thou dost love me 
show me thy thought 


iago

my lord  you know i love you 


othello

i think thou dost 
and  for i know thou full of love and honesty 
and weigh thy words before thou givest them breath 
therefore these stops of thine fright me the more 
for such things in a false disloyal knave
are tricks of custom  but in a man that just
they are close delations  working from the heart
that passion cannot rule 


iago

for michael cassio 
i dare be sworn i think that he is honest 


othello

i think so too 


iago

                  men should be what they seem 
or those that be not  would they might seem none 


othello

certain  men should be what they seem 


iago

why  then  i think cassio an honest man 


othello

nay  yet there more in this 
i prithee  speak to me as to thy thinkings 
as thou dost ruminate  and give thy worst of thoughts
the worst of words 


iago

good my lord  pardon me 
though i am bound to every act of duty 
i am not bound to that all slaves are free to 
utter my thoughts  why  say they are vile and false 
as where that palace whereinto foul things
sometimes intrude not  who has a breast so pure 
but some uncleanly apprehensions
keep leets and law days and in session sit
with meditations lawful 


othello

thou dost conspire against thy friend  iago 
if thou but think him wrong and makest his ear
a stranger to thy thoughts 


iago

i do beseech you 
though i perchance am vicious in my guess 
as  i confess  it is my nature plague
to spy into abuses  and oft my jealousy
shapes faults that are not that your wisdom yet 
from one that so imperfectly conceits 
would take no notice  nor build yourself a trouble
out of his scattering and unsure observance 
it were not for your quiet nor your good 
nor for my manhood  honesty  or wisdom 
to let you know my thoughts 


othello

what dost thou mean 


iago

good name in man and woman  dear my lord 
is the immediate jewel of their souls 
who steals my purse steals trash   something  nothing 
 mine   his  and has been slave to thousands 
but he that filches from me my good name
robs me of that which not enriches him
and makes me poor indeed 


othello

by heaven  i know thy thoughts 


iago

you cannot  if my heart were in your hand 
nor shall not  whilst  in my custody 


othello

ha 


iago

o  beware  my lord  of jealousy 
it is the green eyed monster which doth mock
the meat it feeds on  that cuckold lives in bliss
who  certain of his fate  loves not his wronger 
but  o  what damned minutes tells he o 
who dotes  yet doubts  suspects  yet strongly loves 


othello

o misery 


iago

poor and content is rich and rich enough 
but riches fineless is as poor as winter
to him that ever fears he shall be poor 
good heaven  the souls of all my tribe defend
from jealousy 


othello

                  why  why is this 
think thou i make a lie of jealousy 
to follow still the changes of the moon
with fresh suspicions  no  to be once in doubt
is once to be resolved  exchange me for a goat 
when i shall turn the business of my soul
to such exsufflicate and blown surmises 
matching thy inference   not to make me jealous
to say my wife is fair  feeds well  loves company 
is free of speech  sings  plays and dances well 
where virtue is  these are more virtuous 
nor from mine own weak merits will i draw
the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt 
for she had eyes  and chose me  no  iago 
i see before i doubt  when i doubt  prove 
and on the proof  there is no more but this 
away at once with love or jealousy 


iago

i am glad of it  for now i shall have reason
to show the love and duty that i bear you
with franker spirit  therefore  as i am bound 
receive it from me  i speak not yet of proof 
look to your wife  observe her well with cassio 
wear your eye thus  not jealous nor secure 
i would not have your free and noble nature 
out of self bounty  be abused  look to t 
i know our country disposition well 
in venice they do let heaven see the pranks
they dare not show their husbands  their best conscience
is not to leave undone  but keep unknown 


othello

dost thou say so 


iago

she did deceive her father  marrying you 
and when she seem to shake and fear your looks 
she loved them most 


othello

and so she did 


iago

why  go to then 
she that  so young  could give out such a seeming 
to seal her father eyes up close as oak 
he thought  witchcraft but i am much to blame 
i humbly do beseech you of your pardon
for too much loving you 


othello

i am bound to thee for ever 


iago

i see this hath a little dash your spirits 


othello

not a jot  not a jot 


iago

i  faith  i fear it has 
i hope you will consider what is spoke
comes from my love  but i do see you moved 
i am to pray you not to strain my speech
to grosser issues nor to larger reach
than to suspicion 


othello

i will not 


iago

          should you do so  my lord 
my speech should fall into such vile success
as my thoughts aim not at  cassio my worthy friend 
my lord  i see you moved 


othello

no  not much moved 
i do not think but desdemona honest 


iago

long live she so  and long live you to think so 


othello

and yet  how nature erring from itself 


iago

ay  there the point  as to be bold with you 
not to affect many proposed matches
of her own clime  complexion  and degree 
whereto we see in all things nature tends 
foh  one may smell in such a will most rank 
foul disproportion thoughts unnatural 
but pardon me  i do not in position
distinctly speak of her  though i may fear
her will  recoiling to her better judgment 
may fall to match you with her country forms
and happily repent 


othello

farewell  farewell 
if more thou dost perceive  let me know more 
set on thy wife to observe  leave me  iago 


iago

 going   my lord  i take my leave 


othello

why did i marry  this honest creature doubtless
sees and knows more  much more  than he unfolds 


iago

 returning   my lord  i would i might entreat
your honour
to scan this thing no further  leave it to time 
though it be fit that cassio have his place 
for sure  he fills it up with great ability 
yet  if you please to hold him off awhile 
you shall by that perceive him and his means 
note  if your lady strain his entertainment
with any strong or vehement importunity 
much will be seen in that  in the mean time 
let me be thought too busy in my fears 
as worthy cause i have to fear i am 
and hold her free  i do beseech your honour 


othello

fear not my government 


iago

i once more take my leave 
exit


othello

this fellow of exceeding honesty 
and knows all qualities  with a learned spirit 
of human dealings  if i do prove her haggard 
though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings 
i whistle her off and let her down the wind 
to pray at fortune  haply  for i am black
and have not those soft parts of conversation
that chamberers have  or for i am declined
into the vale of years yet that not much 
she gone  i am abused  and my relief
must be to loathe her  o curse of marriage 
that we can call these delicate creatures ours 
and not their appetites  i had rather be a toad 
and live upon the vapour of a dungeon 
than keep a corner in the thing i love
for others  uses  yet   the plague of great ones 
prerogatived are they less than the base 
 destiny unshunnable  like death 
even then this forked plague is fated to us
when we do quicken  desdemona comes 
re enter desdemona and emilia
if she be false  o  then heaven mocks itself 
i not believe t 


desdemona

how now  my dear othello 
your dinner  and the generous islanders
by you invited  do attend your presence 


othello

i am to blame 


desdemona

                  why do you speak so faintly 
are you not well 


othello

i have a pain upon my forehead here 


desdemona

 faith  that with watching   away again 
let me but bind it hard  within this hour
it will be well 


othello

                  your napkin is too little 
he puts the handkerchief from him  and it drops
let it alone  come  i go in with you 


desdemona

i am very sorry that you are not well 
exeunt othello and desdemona


emilia

i am glad i have found this napkin 
this was her first remembrance from the moor 
my wayward husband hath a hundred times
woo me to steal it  but she so loves the token 
for he conjured her she should ever keep it 
that she reserves it evermore about her
to kiss and talk to  i have the work ta out 
and give iago  what he will do with it
heaven knows  not i 
i nothing but to please his fantasy 
re enter iago


iago

how now  what do you here alone 


emilia

do not you chide  i have a thing for you 


iago

a thing for me  it is a common thing 


emilia

ha 


iago

to have a foolish wife 


emilia

o  is that all  what will you give me now
for the same handkerchief 


iago

what handkerchief 


emilia

what handkerchief 
why  that the moor first gave to desdemona 
that which so often you did bid me steal 


iago

hast stol it from her 


emilia

no   faith  she let it drop by negligence 
and  to the advantage  i  being here  took up 
look  here it is 


iago

                  a good wench  give it me 


emilia

what will you do with  t  that you have been
so earnest
to have me filch it 


iago

 snatching it   why  what that to you 


emilia

if it be not for some purpose of import 
give me again  poor lady  she run mad
when she shall lack it 


iago

be not acknown on  t  i have use for it 
go  leave me 
exit emilia
i will in cassio lodging lose this napkin 
and let him find it  trifles light as air
are to the jealous confirmations strong
as proofs of holy writ  this may do something 
the moor already changes with my poison 
dangerous conceits are  in their natures  poisons 
which at the first are scarce found to distaste 
but with a little act upon the blood 
burn like the mines of sulphur  i did say so 
look  where he comes 
re enter othello
not poppy  nor mandragora 
nor all the drowsy syrups of the world 
shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
which thou owedst yesterday 


othello

ha  ha  false to me 


iago

why  how now  general  no more of that 


othello

avaunt  be gone  thou hast set me on the rack 
i swear  better to be much abused
than but to know a little 


iago

how now  my lord 


othello

what sense had i of her stol hours of lust 
i saw not  thought it not  it harm not me 
i slept the next night well  was free and merry 
i found not cassio kisses on her lips 
he that is robb d  not wanting what is stol n 
let him not know t  and he not robb at all 


iago

i am sorry to hear this 


othello

i had been happy  if the general camp 
pioners and all  had tasted her sweet body 
so i had nothing known  o  now  for ever
farewell the tranquil mind  farewell content 
farewell the plumed troop  and the big wars 
that make ambition virtue  o  farewell 
farewell the neighing steed  and the shrill trump 
the spirit stirring drum  the ear piercing fife 
the royal banner  and all quality 
pride  pomp and circumstance of glorious war 
and  o you mortal engines  whose rude throats
the immortal jove dead clamours counterfeit 
farewell  othello occupation gone 


iago

is possible  my lord 


othello

villain  be sure thou prove my love a whore 
be sure of it  give me the ocular proof 
or by the worth of man eternal soul 
thou hadst been better have been born a dog
than answer my waked wrath 


iago

is come to this 


othello

make me to see t  or  at the least  so prove it 
that the probation bear no hinge nor loop
to hang a doubt on  or woe upon thy life 


iago

my noble lord 


othello

if thou dost slander her and torture me 
never pray more  abandon all remorse 
on horror head horrors accumulate 
do deeds to make heaven weep  all earth amazed 
for nothing canst thou to damnation add
greater than that 


iago

                  o grace  o heaven forgive me 
are you a man  have you a soul or sense 
god be wi  you  take mine office  o wretched fool 
that livest to make thine honesty a vice 
o monstrous world  take note  take note  o world 
to be direct and honest is not safe 
i thank you for this profit  and from hence
i love no friend  sith love breeds such offence 


othello

nay  stay  thou shouldst be honest 


iago

i should be wise  for honesty a fool
and loses that it works for 


othello

by the world 
i think my wife be honest and think she is not 
i think that thou art just and think thou art not 
i have some proof  her name  that was as fresh
as dian visage  is now begrimed and black
as mine own face  if there be cords  or knives 
poison  or fire  or suffocating streams 
i not endure it  would i were satisfied 


iago

i see  sir  you are eaten up with passion 
i do repent me that i put it to you 
you would be satisfied 


othello

would  nay  i will 


iago

and may  but  how  how satisfied  my lord 
would you  the supervisor  grossly gape on 
behold her topp d 


othello

                  death and damnation  o 


iago

it were a tedious difficulty  i think 
to bring them to that prospect  damn them then 
if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
more than their own  what then  how then 
what shall i say  where satisfaction 
it is impossible you should see this 
were they as prime as goats  as hot as monkeys 
as salt as wolves in pride  and fools as gross
as ignorance made drunk  but yet  i say 
if imputation and strong circumstances 
which lead directly to the door of truth 
will give you satisfaction  you may have t 


othello

give me a living reason she disloyal 


iago

i do not like the office 
but  sith i am enter in this cause so far 
prick to by foolish honesty and love 
i will go on  i lay with cassio lately 
and  being troubled with a raging tooth 
i could not sleep 
there are a kind of men so loose of soul 
that in their sleeps will mutter their affairs 
one of this kind is cassio 
in sleep i heard him say  desdemona 
let us be wary  let us hide our loves 
and then  sir  would he gripe and wring my hand 
cry  sweet creature  and then kiss me hard 
as if he pluck up kisses by the roots
that grew upon my lips  then laid his leg
over my thigh  and sigh d  and kiss d  and then
cried  fate that gave thee to the moor 


othello

o monstrous  monstrous 


iago

nay  this was but his dream 


othello

but this denoted a foregone conclusion 
 a shrewd doubt  though it be but a dream 


iago

and this may help to thicken other proofs
that do demonstrate thinly 


othello

i tear her all to pieces 


iago

nay  but be wise  yet we see nothing done 
she may be honest yet  tell me but this 
have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
spotted with strawberries in your wife hand 


othello

i gave her such a one   my first gift 


iago

i know not that  but such a handkerchief 
i am sure it was your wife s did i to day
see cassio wipe his beard with 


othello

if it be that 


iago

if it be that  or any that was hers 
it speaks against her with the other proofs 


othello

o  that the slave had forty thousand lives 
one is too poor  too weak for my revenge 
now do i see  true  look here  iago 
all my fond love thus do i blow to heaven 
 gone 
arise  black vengeance  from thy hollow cell 
yield up  o love  thy crown and hearted throne
to tyrannous hate  swell  bosom  with thy fraught 
for  of aspics  tongues 


iago

yet be content 


othello

o  blood  blood  blood 


iago

patience  i say  your mind perhaps may change 


othello

never  iago  like to the pontic sea 
whose icy current and compulsive course
ne feels retiring ebb  but keeps due on
to the propontic and the hellespont 
even so my bloody thoughts  with violent pace 
shall ne look back  ne ebb to humble love 
till that a capable and wide revenge
swallow them up  now  by yond marble heaven 
kneels
in the due reverence of a sacred vow
i here engage my words 


iago

do not rise yet 
kneels
witness  you ever burning lights above 
you elements that clip us round about 
witness that here iago doth give up
the execution of his wit  hands  heart 
to wrong othello service  let him command 
and to obey shall be in me remorse 
what bloody business ever 
they rise


othello

i greet thy love 
not with vain thanks  but with acceptance bounteous 
and will upon the instant put thee to t 
within these three days let me hear thee say
that cassio not alive
