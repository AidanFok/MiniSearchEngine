scene iv  before the castle 


enter desdemona  emilia  and clown


desdemona

do you know  sirrah  where lieutenant cassio lies 


clown

i dare not say he lies any where 


desdemona

why  man 


clown

he a soldier  and for one to say a soldier lies 
is stabbing 


desdemona

go to  where lodges he 


clown

to tell you where he lodges  is to tell you where i lie 


desdemona

can any thing be made of this 


clown

i know not where he lodges  and for me to devise a
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there  were
to lie in mine own throat 


desdemona

can you inquire him out  and be edified by report 


clown

i will catechise the world for him  that is  make
questions  and by them answer 


desdemona

seek him  bid him come hither  tell him i have
moved my lord on his behalf  and hope all will be well 


clown

to do this is within the compass of man wit  and
therefore i will attempt the doing it 
exit


desdemona

where should i lose that handkerchief  emilia 


emilia

i know not  madam 


desdemona

believe me  i had rather have lost my purse
full of crusadoes  and  but my noble moor
is true of mind and made of no such baseness
as jealous creatures are  it were enough
to put him to ill thinking 


emilia

is he not jealous 


desdemona

who  he  i think the sun where he was born
drew all such humours from him 


emilia

look  where he comes 


desdemona

i will not leave him now till cassio
be call to him 
enter othello
how is with you  my lord


othello

well  my good lady 
aside
o  hardness to dissemble 
how do you  desdemona 


desdemona

well  my good lord 


othello

give me your hand  this hand is moist  my lady 


desdemona

it yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow 


othello

this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart 
hot  hot  and moist  this hand of yours requires
a sequester from liberty  fasting and prayer 
much castigation  exercise devout 
for here a young and sweating devil here 
that commonly rebels   a good hand 
a frank one 


desdemona

                  you may  indeed  say so 
for  that hand that gave away my heart 


othello

a liberal hand  the hearts of old gave hands 
but our new heraldry is hands  not hearts 


desdemona

i cannot speak of this  come now  your promise 


othello

what promise  chuck 


desdemona

i have sent to bid cassio come speak with you 


othello

i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me 
lend me thy handkerchief 


desdemona

here  my lord 


othello

that which i gave you 


desdemona

i have it not about me 


othello

not 


desdemona

   no  indeed  my lord 


othello

that is a fault 
that handkerchief
did an egyptian to my mother give 
she was a charmer  and could almost read
the thoughts of people  she told her  while
she kept it 
 make her amiable and subdue my father
entirely to her love  but if she lost it
or made gift of it  my father eye
should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
after new fancies  she  dying  gave it me 
and bid me  when my fate would have me wive 
to give it her  i did so  and take heed on t 
make it a darling like your precious eye 
to lose or give away were such perdition
as nothing else could match 


desdemona

is possible 


othello

 true  there magic in the web of it 
a sibyl  that had number in the world
the sun to course two hundred compasses 
in her prophetic fury sew the work 
the worms were hallow that did breed the silk 
and it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
conserved of maidens  hearts 


desdemona

indeed  is true 


othello

most veritable  therefore look to well 


desdemona

then would to god that i had never seen t 


othello

ha  wherefore 


desdemona

why do you speak so startingly and rash 


othello

is lost  is gone  speak  is it out
o  the way 


desdemona

heaven bless us 


othello

say you 


desdemona

it is not lost  but what an if it were 


othello

how 


desdemona

i say  it is not lost 


othello

fetch t  let me see t 


desdemona

why  so i can  sir  but i will not now 
this is a trick to put me from my suit 
pray you  let cassio be received again 


othello

fetch me the handkerchief  my mind misgives 


desdemona

come  come 
you never meet a more sufficient man 


othello

the handkerchief 


desdemona

                  i pray  talk me of cassio 


othello

the handkerchief 


desdemona

                  a man that all his time
hath founded his good fortunes on your love 
shared dangers with you 


othello

the handkerchief 


desdemona

in sooth  you are to blame 


othello

away 
exit


emilia

is not this man jealous 


desdemona

i ne saw this before 
sure  there some wonder in this handkerchief 
i am most unhappy in the loss of it 


emilia

 not a year or two shows us a man 
they are all but stomachs  and we all but food 
to eat us hungerly  and when they are full 
they belch us  look you  cassio and my husband 
enter cassio and iago


iago

there is no other way   she must do t 
and  lo  the happiness  go  and importune her 


desdemona

how now  good cassio  what the news with you 


cassio

madam  my former suit  i do beseech you
that by your virtuous means i may again
exist  and be a member of his love
whom i with all the office of my heart
entirely honour  i would not be delay d 
if my offence be of such mortal kind
that nor my service past  nor present sorrows 
nor purposed merit in futurity 
can ransom me into his love again 
but to know so must be my benefit 
so shall i clothe me in a forced content 
and shut myself up in some other course 
to fortune alms 


desdemona

                  alas  thrice gentle cassio 
my advocation is not now in tune 
my lord is not my lord  nor should i know him 
were he in favour as in humour alter d 
so help me every spirit sanctified 
as i have spoken for you all my best
and stood within the blank of his displeasure
for my free speech  you must awhile be patient 
what i can do i will  and more i will
than for myself i dare  let that suffice you 


iago

is my lord angry 


emilia

                  he went hence but now 
and certainly in strange unquietness 


iago

can he be angry  i have seen the cannon 
when it hath blown his ranks into the air 
and  like the devil  from his very arm
puff his own brother and can he be angry 
something of moment then  i will go meet him 
there matter in indeed  if he be angry 


desdemona

i prithee  do so 
exit iago
something  sure  of state 
either from venice  or some unhatch practise
made demonstrable here in cyprus to him 
hath puddled his clear spirit  and in such cases
men natures wrangle with inferior things 
though great ones are their object   even so 
for let our finger ache  and it indues
our other healthful members even to that sense
of pain  nay  we must think men are not gods 
nor of them look for such observances
as fit the bridal  beshrew me much  emilia 
i was  unhandsome warrior as i am 
arraigning his unkindness with my soul 
but now i find i had suborn the witness 
and he indicted falsely 


emilia

pray heaven it be state matters  as you think 
and no conception nor no jealous toy
concerning you 


desdemona

alas the day  i never gave him cause 


emilia

but jealous souls will not be answer so 
they are not ever jealous for the cause 
but jealous for they are jealous   a monster
begot upon itself  born on itself 


desdemona

heaven keep that monster from othello mind 


emilia

lady  amen 


desdemona

i will go seek him  cassio  walk hereabout 
if i do find him fit  i move your suit
and seek to effect it to my uttermost 


cassio

i humbly thank your ladyship 
exeunt desdemona and emilia
enter bianca


bianca

save you  friend cassio 


cassio

what make you from home 
how is it with you  my most fair bianca 
i  faith  sweet love  i was coming to your house 


bianca

and i was going to your lodging  cassio 
what  keep a week away  seven days and nights 
eight score eight hours  and lovers  absent hours 
more tedious than the dial eight score times 
o weary reckoning 


cassio

                  pardon me  bianca 
i have this while with leaden thoughts been press d 
but i shall  in a more continuate time 
strike off this score of absence  sweet bianca 
giving her desdemona handkerchief
take me this work out 


bianca

o cassio  whence came this 
this is some token from a newer friend 
to the felt absence now i feel a cause 
is come to this  well  well 


cassio

go to  woman 
throw your vile guesses in the devil teeth 
from whence you have them  you are jealous now
that this is from some mistress  some remembrance

bianca

why  whose is it 


cassio

i know not  sweet  i found it in my chamber 
i like the work well  ere it be demanded 
as like enough it will i have it copied 
take it  and do t  and leave me for this time 


bianca

leave you  wherefore 


cassio

i do attend here on the general 
and think it no addition  nor my wish 
to have him see me woman d 


bianca

why  i pray you 


cassio

not that i love you not 


bianca

but that you do not love me 
i pray you  bring me on the way a little 
and say if i shall see you soon at night 


cassio

 but a little way that i can bring you 
for i attend here  but i see you soon 


bianca

 very good  i must be circumstanced 
exeunt
