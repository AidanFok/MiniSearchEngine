king henry iv

let there be no noise made  my gentle friends 
unless some dull and favourable hand
will whisper music to my weary spirit 


warwick

call for the music in the other room 


king henry iv

prince henry

no  i will sit and watch here by the king 
exeunt all but prince henry
why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow 
being so troublesome a bedfellow 
o polish perturbation  golden care 
that keep the ports of slumber open wide
to many a watchful night  sleep with it now 
yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
as he whose brow with homely biggen bound
snores out the watch of night  o majesty 
when thou dost pinch thy bearer  thou dost sit
like a rich armour worn in heat of day 
that scalds with safety  by his gates of breath
there lies a downy feather which stirs not 
did he suspire  that light and weightless down
perforce must move  my gracious lord  my father 
this sleep is sound indeed  this is a sleep
that from this golden rigol hath divorced
so many english kings  thy due from me
is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood 
which nature  love  and filial tenderness 
shall  o dear father  pay thee plenteously 
my due from thee is this imperial crown 
which  as immediate as thy place and blood 
derives itself to me  lo  here it sits 
which god shall guard  and put the world whole strength
into one giant arm  it shall not force
this lineal honour from me  this from thee
will i to mine leave  as  left to me 
exit

what would your majesty  how fares your grace 


king henry iv

why did you leave me here alone  my lords 


clarence

we left the prince my brother here  my liege 
who undertook to sit and watch by you 


king henry iv

the prince of wales  where is he  let me see him 
he is not here 


warwick

this door is open  he is gone this way 


gloucester

he came not through the chamber where we stay d 


king henry iv

where is the crown  who took it from my pillow 


warwick

when we withdrew  my liege  we left it here 


king henry iv

the prince hath ta it hence  go  seek him out 
is he so hasty that he doth suppose
my sleep my death 
find him  my lord of warwick  chide him hither 
exit warwick
this part of his conjoins with my disease 
and helps to end me  see  sons  what things you are 
how quickly nature falls into revolt
when gold becomes her object 
for this the foolish over careful fathers
have broke their sleep with thoughts  their brains with care 
their bones with industry 
for this they have engrossed and piled up
the canker heaps of strange achieved gold 
for this they have been thoughtful to invest
their sons with arts and martial exercises 
when  like the bee  culling from every flower
the virtuous sweets 
our thighs pack with wax  our mouths with honey 
we bring it to the hive  and  like the bees 
are murdered for our pains  this bitter taste
yield his engrossments to the ending father 
re enter warwick
now  where is he that will not stay so long
till his friend sickness hath determined me 


warwick

my lord  i found the prince in the next room 
washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks 
with such a deep demeanor in great sorrow
that tyranny  which never quaff but blood 
would  by beholding him  have wash his knife
with gentle eye drops  he is coming hither 


king henry iv

but wherefore did he take away the crown 
re enter prince henry
lo  where he comes  come hither to me  harry 
depart the chamber  leave us here alone 
exeunt warwick and the rest


prince henry

i never thought to hear you speak again 


king henry iv

thy wish was father  harry  to that thought 
i stay too long by thee  i weary thee 
dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
that thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
before thy hour be ripe  o foolish youth 
thou seek the greatness that will o thee 
stay but a little  for my cloud of dignity
is held from falling with so weak a wind
that it will quickly drop  my day is dim 
thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
were thine without offence  and at my death
thou hast seal up my expectation 
thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not 
and thou wilt have me die assured of it 
thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts 
which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart 
to stab at half an hour of my life 
what  canst thou not forbear me half an hour 
then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself 
and bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
that thou art crowned  not that i am dead 
let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
be drops of balm to sanctify thy head 
only compound me with forgotten dust
give that which gave thee life unto the worms 
pluck down my officers  break my decrees 
for now a time is come to mock at form 
harry the fifth is crown d  up  vanity 
down  royal state  all you sage counsellors  hence 
and to the english court assemble now 
from every region  apes of idleness 
now  neighbour confines  purge you of your scum 
have you a ruffian that will swear  drink  dance 
revel the night  rob  murder  and commit
the oldest sins the newest kind of ways 
be happy  he will trouble you no more 
england shall double gild his treble guilt 
england shall give him office  honour  might 
for the fifth harry from curb licence plucks
the muzzle of restraint  and the wild dog
shall flesh his tooth on every innocent 
o my poor kingdom  sick with civil blows 
when that my care could not withhold thy riots 
what wilt thou do when riot is thy care 
o  thou wilt be a wilderness again 
peopled with wolves  thy old inhabitants 


prince henry

o  pardon me  my liege  but for my tears 
the moist impediments unto my speech 
i had forestall this dear and deep rebuke
ere you with grief had spoke and i had heard
the course of it so far  there is your crown 
and he that wears the crown immortally
long guard it yours  if i affect it more
than as your honour and as your renown 
let me no more from this obedience rise 
which my most inward true and duteous spirit
teacheth  this prostrate and exterior bending 
god witness with me  when i here came in 
and found no course of breath within your majesty 
how cold it struck my heart  if i do feign 
o  let me in my present wildness die
and never live to show the incredulous world
the noble change that i have purposed 
coming to look on you  thinking you dead 
and dead almost  my liege  to think you were 
i spake unto this crown as having sense 
and thus upbraided it   care on thee depending
hath fed upon the body of my father 
therefore  thou best of gold art worst of gold 
other  less fine in carat  is more precious 
preserving life in medicine potable 
but thou  most fine  most honour d  most renown d 
hast eat thy bearer up  thus  my most royal liege 
accusing it  i put it on my head 
to try with it  as with an enemy
that had before my face murder my father 
the quarrel of a true inheritor 
but if it did infect my blood with joy 
or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride 
if any rebel or vain spirit of mine
did with the least affection of a welcome
give entertainment to the might of it 
let god for ever keep it from my head
and make me as the poorest vassal is
that doth with awe and terror kneel to it 


king henry iv

o my son 
god put it in thy mind to take it hence 
that thou mightst win the more thy father love 
pleading so wisely in excuse of it 
come hither  harry  sit thou by my bed 
and hear  i think  the very latest counsel
that ever i shall breathe  god knows  my son 
by what by paths and indirect crook ways
i met this crown  and i myself know well
how troublesome it sat upon my head 
to thee it shall descend with bitter quiet 
better opinion  better confirmation 
for all the soil of the achievement goes
with me into the earth  it seem in me
but as an honour snatch with boisterous hand 
and i had many living to upbraid
my gain of it by their assistances 
which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed 
wounding supposed peace  all these bold fears
thou see with peril i have answered 
for all my reign hath been but as a scene
acting that argument  and now my death
changes the mode  for what in me was purchased 
falls upon thee in a more fairer sort 
so thou the garland wear successively 
yet  though thou stand more sure than i could do 
thou art not firm enough  since griefs are green 
and all my friends  which thou must make thy friends 
have but their stings and teeth newly ta out 
by whose fell working i was first advanced
and by whose power i well might lodge a fear
to be again displaced  which to avoid 
i cut them off  and had a purpose now
to lead out many to the holy land 
lest rest and lying still might make them look
too near unto my state  therefore  my harry 
be it thy course to busy giddy minds
with foreign quarrels  that action  hence borne out 
may waste the memory of the former days 
more would i  but my lungs are wasted so
that strength of speech is utterly denied me 
how i came by the crown  o god forgive 
and grant it may with thee in true peace live 


prince henry

my gracious liege 
you won it  wore it  kept it  gave it me 
then plain and right must my possession be 
which i with more than with a common pain
 all the world will rightfully maintain 
enter lord john of lancaster


king henry iv

look  look  here comes my john of lancaster 


lancaster

health  peace  and happiness to my royal father 


king henry iv

thou bring me happiness and peace  son john 
but health  alack  with youthful wings is flown
from this bare wither trunk  upon thy sight
my worldly business makes a period 
where is my lord of warwick 


prince henry

my lord of warwick 
enter warwick  and others


king henry iv

doth any name particular belong
unto the lodging where i first did swoon 


warwick

 call jerusalem  my noble lord 


king henry iv

laud be to god  even there my life must end 
it hath been prophesied to me many years 
i should not die but in jerusalem 
which vainly i supposed the holy land 
but bear me to that chamber  there i lie 
in that jerusalem shall harry die
