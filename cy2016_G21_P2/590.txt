othello

you have seen nothing then 


emilia

nor ever heard  nor ever did suspect 


othello

yes  you have seen cassio and she together 


emilia

but then i saw no harm  and then i heard
each syllable that breath made up between them 


othello

what  did they never whisper 


emilia

never  my lord 


othello

nor send you out o  the way 


emilia

othello

to fetch her fan  her gloves  her mask  nor nothing 


emilia

never  my lord 


othello

that strange 


emilia

i durst  my lord  to wager she is honest 
lay down my soul at stake  if you think other 
remove your thought  it doth abuse your bosom 
if any wretch have put this in your head 
let heaven requite it with the serpent curse 
for  if she be not honest  chaste  and true 
there no man happy  the purest of their wives
is foul as slander 


othello

bid her come hither  go 
exit emilia
she says enough  yet she a simple bawd
that cannot say as much  this is a subtle whore 
a closet lock and key of villanous secrets
and yet she kneel and pray  i have seen her do t 
enter desdemona with emilia


desdemona

my lord  what is your will 


othello

pray  chuck  come hither 


desdemona

othello

let me see your eyes 
look in my face 


desdemona

                  what horrible fancy this 


othello

 to emilia   some of your function  mistress 
leave procreants alone and shut the door 
cough  or cry  hem  if any body come 
your mystery  your mystery  nay  dispatch 
exit emilia


desdemona

upon my knees  what doth your speech import 
i understand a fury in your words 
but not the words 


othello

why  what art thou 


desdemona

your wife  my lord  your true
and loyal wife 


othello

                  come  swear it  damn thyself
lest  being like one of heaven  the devils themselves
should fear to seize thee  therefore be double damn d 
swear thou art honest 


desdemona

heaven doth truly know it 


othello

heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell 


desdemona

to whom  my lord  with whom  how am i false 


othello

o desdemona  away  away  away 


desdemona

alas the heavy day  why do you weep 
am i the motive of these tears  my lord 
if haply you my father do suspect
an instrument of this your calling back 
lay not your blame on me  if you have lost him 
why  i have lost him too 


othello

had it pleased heaven
to try me with affliction  had they rain 
all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head 
steep me in poverty to the very lips 
given to captivity me and my utmost hopes 
i should have found in some place of my soul
a drop of patience  but  alas  to make me
a fixed figure for the time of scorn
to point his slow unmoving finger at 
yet could i bear that too  well  very well 
but there  where i have garner up my heart 
where either i must live  or bear no life 
the fountain from the which my current runs 
or else dries up  to be discarded thence 
or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
to knot and gender in  turn thy complexion there 
patience  thou young and rose lipp cherubin 
ay  there  look grim as hell 


desdemona

i hope my noble lord esteems me honest 


othello

o  ay  as summer flies are in the shambles 
that quicken even with blowing  o thou weed 
who art so lovely fair and smell so sweet
that the sense aches at thee  would thou hadst
ne been born 


desdemona

alas  what ignorant sin have i committed 


othello

was this fair paper  this most goodly book 
made to write  whore  upon  what committed 
committed  o thou public commoner 
i should make very forges of my cheeks 
that would to cinders burn up modesty 
did i but speak thy deeds  what committed 
heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks 
the bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
is hush within the hollow mine of earth 
and will not hear it  what committed 
impudent strumpet 


desdemona

                  by heaven  you do me wrong 


othello

are you not a strumpet 


desdemona

no  as i am a christian 
if to preserve this vessel for my lord
from any other foul unlawful touch
be not to be a strumpet  i am none 


othello

what  not a whore 


desdemona

                  no  as i shall be saved 


othello

is possible 


desdemona

                  o  heaven forgive us 


othello

i cry you mercy  then 
i took you for that cunning whore of venice
that married with othello 
raising his voice
you  mistress 
that have the office opposite to saint peter 
and keep the gate of hell 
re enter emilia
you  you  ay  you 
we have done our course  there money for your pains 
i pray you  turn the key and keep our counsel 
exit

desdemona

i have none  do not talk to me  emilia 
i cannot weep  nor answer have i none 
but what should go by water  prithee  tonight
lay on my bed my wedding sheets  remember 
and call thy husband hither 


emilia

here a change indeed 
exit


desdemona

 meet i should be used so  very meet 
how have i been behaved  that he might stick
the small opinion on my least misuse 
re enter emilia with iago


iago

what is your pleasure  madam 
how is with you 


desdemona

i cannot tell  those that do teach young babes
do it with gentle means and easy tasks 
he might have chid me so  for  in good faith 
i am a child to chiding 


iago

what the matter  lady 


emilia

alas  iago  my lord hath so bewhored her 
thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her 
as true hearts cannot bear 


desdemona

am i that name  iago 


iago

what name  fair lady 


desdemona

such as she says my lord did say i was 


emilia

he call her whore  a beggar in his drink
could not have laid such terms upon his callat 


iago

why did he so 


desdemona

i do not know  i am sure i am none such 


iago

do not weep  do not weep  alas the day 


emilia

hath she forsook so many noble matches 
her father and her country and her friends 
to be call whore  would it not make one weep 


desdemona

it is my wretched fortune 


iago

beshrew him for t 
how comes this trick upon him 


desdemona

nay  heaven doth know 


emilia

i will be hang d  if some eternal villain 
some busy and insinuating rogue 
some cogging  cozening slave  to get some office 
have not devised this slander  i be hang else 


iago

fie  there is no such man  it is impossible 


desdemona

if any such there be  heaven pardon him 


emilia

a halter pardon him  and hell gnaw his bones 
why should he call her whore  who keeps her company 
what place  what time  what form  what likelihood 
the moor abused by some most villanous knave 
some base notorious knave  some scurvy fellow 
o heaven  that such companions thou unfold 
and put in every honest hand a whip
to lash the rascals naked through the world
even from the east to the west 


iago

speak within door 


emilia

o  fie upon them  some such squire he was
that turn your wit the seamy side without 
and made you to suspect me with the moor 


iago

you are a fool  go to 


desdemona

o good iago 
what shall i do to win my lord again 
good friend  go to him  for  by this light of heaven 
i know not how i lost him  here i kneel 
if e my will did trespass  his love 
either in discourse of thought or actual deed 
or that mine eyes  mine ears  or any sense 
delighted them in any other form 
or that i do not yet  and ever did 
and ever will though he do shake me off
to beggarly divorcement love him dearly 
comfort forswear me  unkindness may do much 
and his unkindness may defeat my life 
but never taint my love  i cannot say  whore 
it does abhor me now i speak the word 
to do the act that might the addition earn
not the world mass of vanity could make me 


iago

i pray you  be content   but his humour 
the business of the state does him offence 
and he does chide with you 


desdemona

if  no other 


iago

 but so  i warrant 
trumpets within
hark  how these instruments summon to supper 
the messengers of venice stay the meat 
go in  and weep not  all things shall be well 
exeunt desdemona and emilia
enter roderigo
how now  roderigo 


roderigo

i do not find that thou dealest justly with me 


iago

what in the contrary 


roderigo

every day thou daffest me with some device  iago 
and rather  as it seems to me now  keepest from me
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
advantage of hope  i will indeed no longer endure
it  nor am i yet persuaded to put up in peace what
already i have foolishly suffered 


iago

will you hear me  roderigo 


roderigo

 faith  i have heard too much  for your words and
performances are no kin together 


iago

you charge me most unjustly 


roderigo

with nought but truth  i have wasted myself out of
my means  the jewels you have had from me to
deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a
votarist  you have told me she hath received them
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance  but i find none 


iago

well  go to  very well 


roderigo

very well  go to  i cannot go to  man  nor  
not very well  nay  i think it is scurvy  and begin
to find myself fobbed in it 


iago

very well 


roderigo

i tell you  not very well  i will make myself
known to desdemona  if she will return me my
jewels  i will give over my suit and repent my
unlawful solicitation  if not  assure yourself i
will seek satisfaction of you 


iago

you have said now 


roderigo

ay  and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing 


iago

why  now i see there mettle in thee  and even from
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
ever before  give me thy hand  roderigo  thou hast
taken against me a most just exception  but yet  i
protest  i have dealt most directly in thy affair 


roderigo

it hath not appeared 


iago

i grant indeed it hath not appeared  and your
suspicion is not without wit and judgment  but 
roderigo  if thou hast that in thee indeed  which i
have greater reason to believe now than ever  i mean
purpose  courage and valour  this night show it  if
thou the next night following enjoy not desdemona 
take me from this world with treachery and devise
engines for my life 


roderigo

well  what is it  is it within reason and compass 


iago

sir  there is especial commission come from venice
to depute cassio in othello place 


roderigo

is that true  why  then othello and desdemona
return again to venice 


iago

o  no  he goes into mauritania and takes away with
him the fair desdemona  unless his abode be
lingered here by some accident  wherein none can be
so determinate as the removing of cassio 


roderigo

how do you mean  removing of him 


iago

why  by making him uncapable of othello place 
knocking out his brains 


roderigo

and that you would have me to do 


iago

ay  if you dare do yourself a profit and a right 
he sups to night with a harlotry  and thither will i
go to him  he knows not yet of his horrorable
fortune  if you will watch his going thence  which
i will fashion to fall out between twelve and one 
you may take him at your pleasure  i will be near
to second your attempt  and he shall fall between
us  come  stand not amazed at it  but go along with
me  i will show you such a necessity in his death
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
him  it is now high suppertime  and the night grows
to waste  about it 


roderigo

i will hear further reason for this 


iago

and you shall be satisfied
