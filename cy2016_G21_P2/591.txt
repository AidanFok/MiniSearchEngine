how goes it now  he looks gentler than he did 


desdemona

he says he will return incontinent 
he hath commanded me to go to bed 
and bade me to dismiss you 


emilia

dismiss me 


desdemona

it was his bidding  therefore  good emilia 
give me my nightly wearing  and adieu 
we must not now displease him 


emilia

i would you had never seen him 


desdemona

so would not i	my love doth so approve him 
that even his stubbornness  his cheques  his frowns 
prithee  unpin me have grace and favour in them 


emilia

i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed 


desdemona

all one  good faith  how foolish are our minds 
if i do die before thee prithee  shroud me
in one of those same sheets 


emilia

come  come you talk 


desdemona

my mother had a maid call barbara 
she was in love  and he she loved proved mad
and did forsake her  she had a song of  willow 
an old thing  twas  but it express her fortune 
and she died singing it  that song to night
will not go from my mind  i have much to do 
but to go hang my head all at one side 
and sing it like poor barbara  prithee  dispatch 


emilia

shall i go fetch your night gown 


desdemona

no  unpin me here 
this lodovico is a proper man 


emilia

a very handsome man 


desdemona

he speaks well 


emilia

i know a lady in venice would have walked barefoot
to palestine for a touch of his nether lip 


desdemona

 singing   the poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree 
sing all a green willow 
her hand on her bosom  her head on her knee 
sing willow  willow  willow 
the fresh streams ran by her  and murmur her moans 
sing willow  willow  willow 
her salt tears fell from her  and soften the stones 
lay by these 
singing
sing willow  willow  willow 
prithee  hie thee  he come anon 
singing
sing all a green willow must be my garland 
let nobody blame him  his scorn i approve 
nay  that not next hark  who is that knocks 


emilia

it the wind 


desdemona

 singing   i call my love false love  but what
said he then 
sing willow  willow  willow 
if i court moe women  you couch with moe men 
so  get thee gone  good night ate eyes do itch 
doth that bode weeping 


emilia

 neither here nor there 


desdemona

i have heard it said so  o  these men  these men 
dost thou in conscience think tell me  emilia 
that there be women do abuse their husbands
in such gross kind 


emilia

there be some such  no question 


desdemona

wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world 


emilia

why  would not you 


desdemona

no  by this heavenly light 


emilia

nor i neither by this heavenly light 
i might do as well i  the dark 


desdemona

wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world 


emilia

the world a huge thing  it is a great price 
for a small vice 


desdemona

in troth  i think thou wouldst not 


emilia

in troth  i think i should  and undo when i had
done  marry  i would not do such a thing for a
joint ring  nor for measures of lawn  nor for
gowns  petticoats  nor caps  nor any petty
exhibition  but for the whole world why  who would
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
monarch  i should venture purgatory for t 


desdemona

beshrew me  if i would do such a wrong
for the whole world 


emilia

why the wrong is but a wrong i  the world  and
having the world for your labour  tis a wrong in your
own world  and you might quickly make it right 


desdemona

i do not think there is any such woman 


emilia

yes  a dozen  and as many to the vantage as would
store the world they played for 
but i do think it is their husbands  faults
if wives do fall  say that they slack their duties 
and pour our treasures into foreign laps 
or else break out in peevish jealousies 
throwing restraint upon us  or say they strike us 
or scant our former having in despite 
why  we have galls  and though we have some grace 
yet have we some revenge  let husbands know
their wives have sense like them  they see and smell
and have their palates both for sweet and sour 
as husbands have  what is it that they do
when they change us for others  is it sport 
i think it is  and doth affection breed it 
i think it doth  is frailty that thus errs 
it is so too  and have not we affections 
desires for sport  and frailty  as men have 
then let them use us well  else let them know 
the ills we do  their ills instruct us so 


desdemona

good night  good night  heaven me such uses send 
not to pick bad from bad  but by bad mend 
exeunt
