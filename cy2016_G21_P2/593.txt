scene ii  a bedchamber in the castle  desdemona in bed asleep 


a light burning 
enter othello


othello

it is the cause  it is the cause  my soul 
let me not name it to you  you chaste stars 
it is the cause  yet i not shed her blood 
nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow 
and smooth as monumental alabaster 
yet she must die  else she betray more men 
put out the light  and then put out the light 
if i quench thee  thou flaming minister 
i can again thy former light restore 
should i repent me  but once put out thy light 
thou cunning pattern of excelling nature 
i know not where is that promethean heat
that can thy light relume  when i have pluck the rose 
i cannot give it vital growth again 
it must needs wither  i smell it on the tree 
kissing her
ah balmy breath  that dost almost persuade
justice to break her sword  one more  one more 
be thus when thou art dead  and i will kill thee 
and love thee after  one more  and this the last 
so sweet was ne so fatal  i must weep 
but they are cruel tears  this sorrow heavenly 
it strikes where it doth love  she wakes 


desdemona

who there  othello 


othello

ay  desdemona 


desdemona

will you come to bed  my lord 


othello

have you pray to night  desdemona 


desdemona

ay  my lord 


othello

if you bethink yourself of any crime
unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace 
solicit for it straight 


desdemona

alas  my lord  what do you mean by that 


othello

well  do it  and be brief  i will walk by 
i would not kill thy unprepared spirit 
no  heaven forfend  i would not kill thy soul 


desdemona

talk you of killing 


othello

ay  i do 


desdemona

then heaven
have mercy on me 


othello

                  amen  with all my heart 


desdemona

if you say so  i hope you will not kill me 


othello

hum 


desdemona

and yet i fear you  for you are fatal then
when your eyes roll so  why i should fear i know not 
since guiltiness i know not  but yet i feel i fear 


othello

think on thy sins 


desdemona

                  they are loves i bear to you 


othello

ay  and for that thou diest 


desdemona

that death unnatural that kills for loving 
alas  why gnaw you so your nether lip 
some bloody passion shakes your very frame 
these are portents  but yet i hope  i hope 
they do not point on me 


othello

peace  and be still 


desdemona

i will so  what the matter 


othello

that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee
thou gavest to cassio 


desdemona

no  by my life and soul 
send for the man  and ask him 


othello

sweet soul  take heed 
take heed of perjury  thou art on thy deathbed 


desdemona

ay  but not yet to die 


othello

yes  presently 
therefore confess thee freely of thy sin 
for to deny each article with oath
cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
that i do groan withal  thou art to die 


desdemona

then lord have mercy on me 


othello

i say  amen 


desdemona

and have you mercy too  i never did
offend you in my life  never loved cassio
but with such general warranty of heaven
as i might love  i never gave him token 


othello

by heaven  i saw my handkerchief in hand 
o perjured woman  thou dost stone my heart 
and makest me call what i intend to do
a murder  which i thought a sacrifice 
i saw the handkerchief 


desdemona

he found it then 
i never gave it him  send for him hither 
let him confess a truth 


othello

he hath confess d 


desdemona

what  my lord 


othello

desdemona

how  unlawfully

desdemona

he will not say so 


othello

no  his mouth is stopp d 
honest iago hath ta order for t 


desdemona

o  my fear interprets  what  is he dead 


othello

had all his hairs been lives  my great revenge
had stomach for them all 


desdemona

alas  he is betray and i undone 


othello

out  strumpet  weep thou for him to my face 


desdemona

o  banish me  my lord  but kill me not 


othello

down  strumpet 


desdemona

kill me to morrow  let me live to night 


othello

nay  if you strive 


desdemona

but half an hour 


othello

                  being done  there is no pause 


desdemona

but while i say one prayer 


othello

lodovico

where is this rash and most unfortunate man 


othello

that he that was othello  here i am 


lodovico

where is that viper  bring the villain forth 


othello

i look down towards his feet  but that a fable 
if that thou best a devil  i cannot kill thee 
wounds iago


lodovico

wrench his sword from him 


iago

i bleed  sir  but not kill d 


othello

i am not sorry neither  i have thee live 
for  in my sense   happiness to die 


lodovico

o thou othello  thou wert once so good 
fall in the practise of a damned slave 
what shall be said to thee 


othello

why  any thing 
an honourable murderer  if you will 
for nought i did in hate  but all in honour 


lodovico

this wretch hath part confess his villany 
did you and he consent in cassio death 


othello

ay 


cassio

dear general  i never gave you cause 


othello

i do believe it  and i ask your pardon 
will you  i pray  demand that demi devil
why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body 


iago

demand me nothing  what you know  you know 
from this time forth i never will speak word 


lodovico

what  not to pray 


gratiano

                  torments will ope your lips 


othello

well  thou dost best 


lodovico

sir  you shall understand what hath befall n 
which  as i think  you know not  here is a letter
found in the pocket of the slain roderigo 
and here another  the one of them imports
the death of cassio to be undertook
by roderigo 


othello

o villain 


cassio

most heathenish and most gross 


lodovico

now here another discontented paper 
found in his pocket too  and this  it seems 
roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain 
but that belike iago in the interim
came in and satisfied him 


othello

o the pernicious caitiff 
how came you  cassio  by that handkerchief
that was my wife s 


cassio

i found it in my chamber 
and he himself confess but even now
that there he dropp it for a special purpose
which wrought to his desire 


othello

o fool  fool  fool 


cassio

there is besides in roderigo letter 
how he upbraids iago  that he made him
brave me upon the watch  whereon it came
that i was cast  and even but now he spake 
after long seeming dead  iago hurt him 
iago set him on 


lodovico

you must forsake this room  and go with us 
your power and your command is taken off 
and cassio rules in cyprus  for this slave 
if there be any cunning cruelty
that can torment him much and hold him long 
it shall be his  you shall close prisoner rest 
till that the nature of your fault be known
to the venetian state  come  bring him away 


othello

soft you  a word or two before you go 
i have done the state some service  and they know t 
no more of that  i pray you  in your letters 
when you shall these unlucky deeds relate 
speak of me as i am  nothing extenuate 
nor set down aught in malice  then must you speak
of one that loved not wisely but too well 
of one not easily jealous  but being wrought
perplex in the extreme  of one whose hand 
like the base indian  threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe  of one whose subdued eyes 
albeit unused to the melting mood 
drop tears as fast as the arabian trees
their medicinal gum  set you down this 
and say besides  that in aleppo once 
where a malignant and a turban turk
beat a venetian and traduced the state 
i took by the throat the circumcised dog 
and smote him  thus 
stabs himself


lodovico

o bloody period 


gratiano

                  all that spoke is marr d 


othello

i kiss thee ere i kill thee  no way but this 
killing myself  to die upon a kiss 
falls on the bed  and dies


cassio

this did i fear  but thought he had no weapon 
for he was great of heart 


lodovico

 to iago   o spartan dog 
more fell than anguish  hunger  or the sea 
look on the tragic loading of this bed 
this is thy work  the object poisons sight 
let it be hid  gratiano  keep the house 
and seize upon the fortunes of the moor 
for they succeed on you  to you  lord governor 
remains the censure of this hellish villain 
the time  the place  the torture  o  enforce it 
myself will straight aboard  and to the state
this heavy act with heavy heart relate 
exeunt
