prologue


enter gower


before the palace of antioch


to sing a song that old was sung 
from ashes ancient gower is come 
assuming man infirmities 
to glad your ear  and please your eyes 
it hath been sung at festivals 
on ember eves and holy ales 
and lords and ladies in their lives
have read it for restoratives 
the purchase is to make men glorious 
et bonum quo antiquius  eo melius 
if you  born in these latter times 
when wit more ripe  accept my rhymes 
and that to hear an old man sing
may to your wishes pleasure bring
i life would wish  and that i might
waste it for you  like taper light 
this antioch  then  antiochus the great
built up  this city  for his chiefest seat 
the fairest in all syria 
i tell you what mine authors say 
this king unto him took a fere 
who died and left a female heir 
so buxom  blithe  and full of face 
as heaven had lent her all his grace 
with whom the father liking took 
and her to incest did provoke 
bad child  worse father  to entice his own
to evil should be done by none 
but custom what they did begin
was with long use account no sin 
the beauty of this sinful dame
made many princes thither frame 
to seek her as a bed fellow 
in marriage pleasures play fellow 
which to prevent he made a law 
to keep her still  and men in awe 
that whoso ask her for his wife 
his riddle told not  lost his life 
so for her many a wight did die 
as yon grim looks do testify 
what now ensues  to the judgment of your eye
i give  my cause who best can justify 
exit
