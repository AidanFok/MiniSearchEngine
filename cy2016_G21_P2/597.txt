thaliard

so  this is tyre  and this the court  here must i
kill king pericles  and if i do it not  i am sure to
be hanged at home   dangerous  well  i perceive
he was a wise fellow  and had good discretion  that 
being bid to ask what he would of the king  desired
he might know none of his secrets  now do i see he
had some reason for t  for if a king bid a man be a
villain  he bound by the indenture of his oath to
be one  hush  here come the lords of tyre 
enter helicanus and escanes  with other lords of tyre


helicanus

you shall not need  my fellow peers of tyre 
further to question me of your king departure 
his seal commission  left in trust with me 
doth speak sufficiently he gone to travel 


thaliard

 aside   how  the king gone 


helicanus

if further yet you will be satisfied 
why  as it were unlicensed of your loves 
he would depart  i give some light unto you 
being at antioch 


thaliard

 aside           what from antioch 


helicanus

royal antiochus on what cause i know not 
took some displeasure at him  at least he judged so 
and doubting lest that he had err or sinn d 
to show his sorrow  he correct himself 
so puts himself unto the shipman toil 
with whom each minute threatens life or death 


thaliard

 aside   well  i perceive
i shall not be hang now  although i would 
but since he gone  the king seas must please 
he  the land  to perish at the sea 
i present myself  peace to the lords of tyre 


helicanus

lord thaliard from antiochus is welcome 


thaliard

from him i come
with message unto princely pericles 
but since my landing i have understood
your lord has betook himself to unknown travels 
my message must return from whence it came 


helicanus

we have no reason to desire it 
commended to our master  not to us 
yet  ere you shall depart  this we desire 
as friends to antioch  we may feast in tyre 
exeunt
