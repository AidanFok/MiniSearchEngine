enter pericles  wet


pericles

yet cease your ire  you angry stars of heaven 
wind  rain  and thunder  remember  earthly man
is but a substance that must yield to you 
and i  as fits my nature  do obey you 
alas  the sea hath cast me on the rocks 
wash me from shore to shore  and left me breath
nothing to think on but ensuing death 
let it suffice the greatness of your powers
to have bereft a prince of all his fortunes 
and having thrown him from your watery grave 
here to have death in peace is all he crave 
enter three fishermen


first fisherman

what  ho  pilch 


second fisherman

ha  come and bring away the nets 


first fisherman

what  patch breech  i say 


third fisherman

what say you  master 


first fisherman

look how thou stirrest now  come away  or i 
fetch thee with a wanion 


third fisherman

faith  master  i am thinking of the poor men that
were cast away before us even now 


first fisherman

alas  poor souls  it grieved my heart to hear what
pitiful cries they made to us to help them  when 
well a day  we could scarce help ourselves 


third fisherman

nay  master  said not i as much when i saw the
porpus how he bounced and tumbled  they say
they half fish  half flesh  a plague on them 
they ne come but i look to be washed  master  i
marvel how the fishes live in the sea 


first fisherman

why  as men do a land  the great ones eat up the
little ones  i can compare our rich misers to
nothing so fitly as to a whale  a  plays and
tumbles  driving the poor fry before him  and at
last devours them all at a mouthful  such whales
have i heard on o  the land  who never leave gaping
till they swallowed the whole parish  church 
steeple  bells  and all 


pericles

 aside   a pretty moral 


third fisherman

but  master  if i had been the sexton  i would have
been that day in the belfry 


second fisherman

why  man 


third fisherman

because he should have swallowed me too  and when i
had been in his belly  i would have kept such a
jangling of the bells  that he should never have
left  till he cast bells  steeple  church  and
parish up again  but if the good king simonides
were of my mind 


pericles

 aside   simonides 


third fisherman

we would purge the land of these drones  that rob
the bee of her honey 


pericles

 aside   how from the finny subject of the sea
these fishers tell the infirmities of men 
and from their watery empire recollect
all that may men approve or men detect 
peace be at your labour  honest fishermen 


second fisherman

honest  good fellow  what that  if it be a day
fits you  search out of the calendar  and nobody
look after it 


pericles

may see the sea hath cast upon your coast 


second fisherman

what a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our
way 


pericles

a man whom both the waters and the wind 
in that vast tennis court  have made the ball
for them to play upon  entreats you pity him 
he asks of you  that never used to beg 


first fisherman

no  friend  cannot you beg  here them in our
country greece gets more with begging than we can do
with working 


second fisherman

canst thou catch any fishes  then 


pericles

i never practised it 


second fisherman

nay  then thou wilt starve  sure  for here nothing
to be got now a days  unless thou canst fish for t 


pericles

what i have been i have forgot to know 
but what i am  want teaches me to think on 
a man throng up with cold  my veins are chill 
and have no more of life than may suffice
to give my tongue that heat to ask your help 
which if you shall refuse  when i am dead 
for that i am a man  pray see me buried 


first fisherman

die quoth a  now gods forbid  i have a gown here 
come  put it on  keep thee warm  now  afore me  a
handsome fellow  come  thou shalt go home  and
we have flesh for holidays  fish for
fasting days  and moreo puddings and flap jacks 
and thou shalt be welcome 


pericles

i thank you  sir 


second fisherman

hark you  my friend  you said you could not beg 


pericles

i did but crave 


second fisherman

but crave  then i turn craver too  and so i
shall  whipping 


pericles

why  are all your beggars whipped  then 


second fisherman

o  not all  my friend  not all  for if all your
beggars were whipped  i would wish no better office
than to be beadle  but  master  i go draw up the
net 
exit with third fisherman


pericles

 aside   how well this honest mirth becomes their labour 


first fisherman

hark you  sir  do you know where ye are 


pericles

not well 


first fisherman

why  i tell you  this is called pentapolis  and
our king the good simonides 


pericles

the good king simonides  do you call him 


first fisherman

ay  sir  and he deserves so to be called for his
peaceable reign and good government 


pericles

he is a happy king  since he gains from his subjects
the name of good by his government  how far is his
court distant from this shore 


first fisherman

marry  sir  half a day journey  and i tell
you  he hath a fair daughter  and to morrow is her
birth day  and there are princes and knights come
from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love 


pericles

were my fortunes equal to my desires  i could wish
to make one there 


first fisherman

o  sir  things must be as they may  and what a man
cannot get  he may lawfully deal for his wife soul 
re enter second and third fishermen  drawing up a net


second fisherman

help  master  help  here a fish hangs in the net 
like a poor man right in the law   hardly
come out  ha  bots on t   come at last  and
 turned to a rusty armour 


pericles

an armour  friends  i pray you  let me see it 
thanks  fortune  yet  that  after all my crosses 
thou givest me somewhat to repair myself 
and though it was mine own  part of my heritage 
which my dead father did bequeath to me 
with this strict charge  even as he left his life 
 it  my pericles  it hath been a shield
twixt me and death and pointed to this brace 
 that it saved me  keep it  in like necessity 
the which the gods protect thee from may
defend thee 
it kept where i kept  i so dearly loved it 
till the rough seas  that spare not any man 
took it in rage  though calm have given again 
i thank thee for t  my shipwreck now no ill 
since i have here my father gift in will 


first fisherman

what mean you  sir 


pericles

to beg of you  kind friends  this coat of worth 
for it was sometime target to a king 
i know it by this mark  he loved me dearly 
and for his sake i wish the having of it 
and that you guide me to your sovereign court 
where with it i may appear a gentleman 
and if that ever my low fortune better 
i pay your bounties  till then rest your debtor 


first fisherman

why  wilt thou tourney for the lady 


pericles

i show the virtue i have borne in arms 


first fisherman

why  do  take it  and the gods give thee good on t 


second fisherman

ay  but hark you  my friend   we that made up
this garment through the rough seams of the waters 
there are certain condolements  certain vails  i
hope  sir  if you thrive  you remember from
whence you had it 


pericles

believe  t  i will 
by your furtherance i am clothed in steel 
and  spite of all the rapture of the sea 
this jewel holds his building on my arm 
unto thy value i will mount myself
upon a courser  whose delightful steps
shall make the gazer joy to see him tread 
only  my friend  i yet am unprovided
of a pair of bases 


second fisherman

we sure provide  thou shalt have my best gown to
make thee a pair  and i bring thee to the court myself 


pericles

then honour be but a goal to my will 
this day i rise  or else add ill to ill 
exeunt
