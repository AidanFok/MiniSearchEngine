to a leash of drawers  and can call them all by
their christen names  as tom  dick  and francis

though i be but the prince of wales  yet i am king
of courtesy  and tell me flatly i am no proud jack 
like falstaff  but a corinthian  a lad of mettle  a
good boy  by the lord  so they call me  and when i
am king of england  i shall command all the good
lads in eastcheap  they call drinking deep  dyeing
scarlet  and when you breathe in your watering  they
cry   hem  and bid you play it off  to conclude  i
am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour 
that i can drink with any tinker in his own language
during my life  i tell thee  ned  thou hast lost
much honour  that thou wert not with me in this sweet
action  but  sweet ned to sweeten which name of
ned  i give thee this pennyworth of sugar  clapped

swear truth out of england but he would make you
believe it was done in fight  and persuaded us to do the like 


bardolph

make them bleed  and then to beslubber our garments
with it and swear it was the blood of true men  i
did that i did not this seven year before  i blushed
to hear his monstrous devices 


prince henry

o villain  thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
ago  and wert taken with the manner  and ever since
thou hast blushed extempore  thou hadst fire and
sword on thy side  and yet thou rannest away  what

hook what a plague call you him

prince henry

and one mordake  and a thousand blue caps more 
worcester is stolen away to night  thy father 
beard is turned white with the news  you may buy
land now as cheap as stinking mackerel

this civil buffeting hold  we shall buy maidenheads
as they buy hob nails  by the hundreds 


falstaff

by the mass  lad  thou sayest true  it is like we
shall have good trading that way  but tell me  hal

heir apparent  could the world pick thee out three
such enemies again as that fiend douglas  that
spirit percy  and that devil glendower  art thou
not horribly afraid  doth not thy blood thrill at
it 


prince henry

not a whit  i  faith  i lack some of thy instinct 


falstaff

comest to thy father  if thou love me  practise an answer 


prince henry

do thou stand for my father  and examine me upon the
particulars of my life 


falstaff

shall i  content  this chair shall be my state 
this dagger my sceptre  and this cushion my crown 


prince henry

thy state is taken for a joined stool  thy golden
sceptre for a leaden dagger  and thy precious rich
crown for a pitiful bald crown 


falstaff

well  an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee 
now shalt thou be moved  give me a cup of sack to
make my eyes look red  that it may be thought i have
wept  for i must speak in passion  and i will do it
in king cambyses  vein 


prince henry

well  here is my leg 


falstaff

and here is my speech  stand aside  nobility 


hostess

o jesu  this is excellent sport  i  faith 


falstaff

weep not  sweet queen  for trickling tears are vain 


hostess

o  the father  how he holds his countenance 


falstaff

for god sake  lords  convey my tristful queen 
for tears do stop the flood gates of her eyes 


hostess

o jesu  he doth it as like one of these harlotry
players as ever i see 


falstaff

peace  good pint pot  peace  good tickle brain 
harry  i do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
time  but also how thou art accompanied  for though
the camomile  the more it is trodden on the faster
it grows  yet youth  the more it is wasted the
sooner it wears  that thou art my son  i have
partly thy mother word  partly my own opinion 
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
foolish hanging of thy nether lip  that doth warrant
me  if then thou be son to me  here lies the point 
why  being son to me  art thou so pointed at  shall
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
blackberries  a question not to be asked  shall
the sun of england prove a thief and take purses  a
question to be asked  there is a thing  harry 
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
many in our land by the name of pitch  this pitch 
as ancient writers do report  doth defile  so doth
the company thou keepest  for  harry  now i do not
speak to thee in drink but in tears  not in
pleasure but in passion  not in words only  but in
woes also  and yet there is a virtuous man whom i
have often noted in thy company  but i know not his name 


prince henry

what manner of man  an it like your majesty 


falstaff

a goodly portly man  i  faith  and a corpulent  of a
cheerful look  a pleasing eye and a most noble
carriage  and  as i think  his age some fifty  or 
by lady  inclining to three score  and now i
remember me  his name is falstaff  if that man
should be lewdly given  he deceiveth me  for  harry 
i see virtue in his looks  if then the tree may be
known by the fruit  as the fruit by the tree  then 
peremptorily i speak it  there is virtue in that
falstaff  him keep with  the rest banish  and tell
me now  thou naughty varlet  tell me  where hast
thou been this month 


prince henry

dost thou speak like a king  do thou stand for me 
and i play my father 


falstaff

depose me  if thou dost it half so gravely  so
majestically  both in word and matter  hang me up by
the heels for a rabbit sucker or a poulter hare 


prince henry

well  here i am set 


falstaff

and here i stand  judge  my masters 


prince henry

now  harry  whence come you 


falstaff

my noble lord  from eastcheap 


prince henry

the complaints i hear of thee are grievous 


falstaff

 sblood  my lord  they are false  nay  i tickle
ye for a young prince  i  faith 


prince henry

swearest thou  ungracious boy  henceforth ne look
on me  thou art violently carried away from grace 
there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
old fat man  a tun of man is thy companion  why
dost thou converse with that trunk of humours  that
bolting hutch of beastliness  that swollen parcel
of dropsies  that huge bombard of sack  that stuffed
cloak bag of guts  that roasted manningtree ox with
the pudding in his belly  that reverend vice  that
grey iniquity  that father ruffian  that vanity in
years  wherein is he good  but to taste sack and
drink it  wherein neat and cleanly  but to carve a
capon and eat it  wherein cunning  but in craft 
wherein crafty  but in villany  wherein villanous 
but in all things  wherein worthy  but in nothing 


falstaff

i would your grace would take me with you  whom
means your grace 


prince henry

that villanous abominable misleader of youth 
falstaff  that old white bearded satan 


falstaff

my lord  the man i know 


prince henry

i know thou dost 


falstaff

but to say i know more harm in him than in myself 
were to say more than i know  that he is old  the
more the pity  his white hairs do witness it  but
that he is  saving your reverence  a whoremaster 
that i utterly deny  if sack and sugar be a fault 
god help the wicked  if to be old and merry be a
sin  then many an old host that i know is damned  if
to be fat be to be hated  then pharaoh lean kine
are to be loved  no  my good lord  banish peto 
banish bardolph  banish poins  but for sweet jack
