i will not excuse you  you shall not be excused 
excuses shall not be admitted  there is no excuse
shall serve  you shall not be excused  why  davy 
enter davy


davy

here  sir

davy  davy  davy  davy  let me see  davy  let me
see  davy  let me see  yea  marry  william cook 
bid him come hither  sir john  you shall not be excused 


davy

marry  sir  thus  those precepts cannot be served 
and  again  sir  shall we sow the headland with wheat 


shallow

with red wheat  davy  but for william cook  are
there no young pigeons 


davy

yes  sir  here is now the smith note for shoeing
and plough irons 


shallow

let it be cast and paid  sir john  you shall not be excused 


davy

now  sir  a new link to the bucket must need be
had  and  sir  do you mean to stop any of william 
wages  about the sack he lost the other day at
hinckley fair 


shallow

a  shall answer it  some pigeons  davy  a couple
of short legged hens  a joint of mutton  and any
pretty little tiny kickshaws  tell william cook 


davy

doth the man of war stay all night  sir 


shallow

yea  davy  i will use him well  a friend i  the
court is better than a penny in purse  use his men
well  davy  for they are arrant knaves  and will backbite 


davy

no worse than they are backbitten  sir  for they
have marvellous foul linen 


shallow

well conceited  davy  about thy business  davy 


davy

i beseech you  sir  to countenance william visor of
woncot against clement perkes of the hill 


shallow

there is many complaints  davy  against that visor 
that visor is an arrant knave  on my knowledge 


davy

i grant your worship that he is a knave  sir  but
yet  god forbid  sir  but a knave should have some
countenance at his friend request  an honest
man  sir  is able to speak for himself  when a knave
is not  i have served your worship truly  sir 
this eight years  and if i cannot once or twice in
a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man  i
have but a very little credit with your worship  the
knave is mine honest friend  sir  therefore  i
beseech your worship  let him be countenanced 


shallow

go to  i say he shall have no wrong  look about  davy 
exit davy
where are you  sir john  come  come  come  off
with your boots  give me your hand  master bardolph 


bardolph

i am glad to see your worship 


shallow

i thank thee with all my heart  kind
master bardolph  and welcome  my tall fellow 
to the page
come  sir john 


falstaff

i follow you  good master robert shallow 
exit shallow
bardolph  look to our horses 
exeunt bardolph and page
if i were sawed into quantities  i should make four
dozen of such bearded hermits  staves as master
shallow  it is a wonderful thing to see the
semblable coherence of his men spirits and his 
they  by observing of him  do bear themselves like
foolish justices  he  by conversing with them  is
turned into a justice like serving man  their
spirits are so married in conjunction with the
participation of society that they flock together in
consent  like so many wild geese  if i had a suit
to master shallow  i would humour his men with the
imputation of being near their master  if to his
men  i would curry with master shallow that no man
could better command his servants  it is certain
that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
caught  as men take diseases  one of another 
therefore let men take heed of their company  i
will devise matter enough out of this shallow to
keep prince harry in continual laughter the wearing
out of six fashions  which is four terms  or two
actions  and a  shall laugh without intervallums  o 
it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
had the ache in his shoulders  o  you shall see him
laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up 


shallow

 within   sir john 


falstaff

i come  master shallow  i come  master shallow 
exit
