simonides

are the knights ready to begin the triumph 


first lord

they are  my liege 
and stay your coming to present themselves 


simonides

return them  we are ready  and our daughter 
in honour of whose birth these triumphs are 
sits here  like beauty child  whom nature gat
for men to see  and seeing wonder at 
exit a lord


thaisa

it pleaseth you  my royal father  to express
my commendations great  whose merit less 


simonides

it fit it should be so  for princes are
a model which heaven makes like to itself 
as jewels lose their glory if neglected 
so princes their renowns if not respected 
 now your honour  daughter  to explain
the labour of each knight in his device 


thaisa

which  to preserve mine honour  i perform 
enter a knight  he passes over  and his squire presents his shield to the princess


simonides

who is the first that doth prefer himself 


thaisa

a knight of sparta  my renowned father 
and the device he bears upon his shield
is a black ethiope reaching at the sun
the word   tua vita mihi 


simonides

he loves you well that holds his life of you 
the second knight passes over
who is the second that presents himself 


thaisa

a prince of macedon  my royal father 
and the device he bears upon his shield
is an arm knight that conquer by a lady 
the motto thus  in spanish   por dulzura que por fuerza 
the third knight passes over


simonides

and what the third 


thaisa

the third of antioch 
and his device  a wreath of chivalry 
the word   pompae provexit apex 
the fourth knight passes over


simonides

what is the fourth 


thaisa

a burning torch that turned upside down 
the word   me alit  me extinguit 


simonides

which shows that beauty hath his power and will 
which can as well inflame as it can kill 
the fifth knight passes over


thaisa

the fifth  an hand environed with clouds 
holding out gold that by the touchstone tried 
the motto thus   spectanda fides 
the sixth knight  pericles  passes over


simonides

and what 
the sixth and last  the which the knight himself
with such a graceful courtesy deliver d 


thaisa

he seems to be a stranger  but his present is
a wither branch  that only green at top 
the motto   hac spe vivo 


simonides

a pretty moral 
from the dejected state wherein he is 
he hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish 


first lord

he had need mean better than his outward show
can any way speak in his just commend 
for by his rusty outside he appears
to have practised more the whipstock than the lance 


second lord

he well may be a stranger  for he comes
to an honour triumph strangely furnished 


third lord

and on set purpose let his armour rust
until this day  to scour it in the dust 


simonides

opinion but a fool  that makes us scan
the outward habit by the inward man 
but stay  the knights are coming  we will withdraw
into the gallery 
exeunt
great shouts within and all cry  mean knight
