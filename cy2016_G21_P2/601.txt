scene iii  the same  a hall of state  a banquet prepared 


enter simonides  thaisa  lords  attendants  and knights  from tilting


simonides

knights 
to say you welcome were superfluous 
to place upon the volume of your deeds 
as in a title page  your worth in arms 
were more than you expect  or more than fit 
since every worth in show commends itself 
prepare for mirth  for mirth becomes a feast 
you are princes and my guests 


thaisa

but you  my knight and guest 
to whom this wreath of victory i give 
and crown you king of this day happiness 


pericles

 more by fortune  lady  than by merit 


simonides

call it by what you will  the day is yours 
and here  i hope  is none that envies it 
in framing an artist  art hath thus decreed 
to make some good  but others to exceed 
and you are her labour scholar  come  queen o 
the feast 
for  daughter  so you are here take your place 
marshal the rest  as they deserve their grace 


knights

we are honour much by good simonides 


simonides

your presence glads our days  honour we love 
for who hates honour hates the gods above 


marshal

sir  yonder is your place 


pericles

some other is more fit 


first knight

contend not  sir  for we are gentlemen
that neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
envy the great nor do the low despise 


pericles

you are right courteous knights 


simonides

sit  sir  sit 


pericles

by jove  i wonder  that is king of thoughts 
these cates resist me  she but thought upon 


thaisa

by juno  that is queen of marriage 
all viands that i eat do seem unsavoury 
wishing him my meat  sure  he a gallant gentleman 


simonides

he but a country gentleman 
has done no more than other knights have done 
has broken a staff or so  so let it pass 


thaisa

to me he seems like diamond to glass 


pericles

yon king to me like to my father picture 
which tells me in that glory once he was 
had princes sit  like stars  about his throne 
and he the sun  for them to reverence 
none that beheld him  but  like lesser lights 
did vail their crowns to his supremacy 
where now his son like a glow worm in the night 
the which hath fire in darkness  none in light 
whereby i see that time the king of men 
he both their parent  and he is their grave 
and gives them what he will  not what they crave 


simonides

what  are you merry  knights 


knights

who can be other in this royal presence 


simonides

here  with a cup that stored unto the brim 
as you do love  fill to your mistress  lips 
we drink this health to you 


knights

we thank your grace 


simonides

yet pause awhile 
yon knight doth sit too melancholy 
as if the entertainment in our court
had not a show might countervail his worth 
note it not you  thaisa 


thaisa

what is it
to me  my father 


simonides

                  o  attend  my daughter 
princes in this should live like gods above 
who freely give to every one that comes
to honour them 
and princes not doin g so are like to gnats 
which make a sound  but kill are wonder at 
therefore to make his entrance more sweet 
here  say we drink this standing bowl of wine to him 


thaisa

alas  my father  it befits not me
unto a stranger knight to be so bold 
he may my proffer take for an offence 
since men take women gifts for impudence 


simonides

how 
do as i bid you  or you move me else 


thaisa

 aside   now  by the gods  he could not please me better 


simonides

and furthermore tell him  we desire to know of him 
of whence he is  his name and parentage 


thaisa

the king my father  sir  has drunk to you 


pericles

i thank him 


thaisa

wishing it so much blood unto your life 


pericles

i thank both him and you  and pledge him freely 


thaisa

and further he desires to know of you 
of whence you are  your name and parentage 


pericles

a gentleman of tyre  my name  pericles 
my education been in arts and arms 
who  looking for adventures in the world 
was by the rough seas reft of ships and men 
and after shipwreck driven upon this shore 


thaisa

he thanks your grace  names himself pericles 
a gentleman of tyre 
who only by misfortune of the seas
bereft of ships and men  cast on this shore 


simonides

now  by the gods  i pity his misfortune 
and will awake him from his melancholy 
come  gentlemen  we sit too long on trifles 
and waste the time  which looks for other revels 
even in your armours  as you are address d 
will very well become a soldier dance 
i will not have excuse  with saying this
loud music is too harsh for ladies  heads 
since they love men in arms as well as beds 
the knights dance
so  this was well ask d so well perform d 
come  sir 
here is a lady that wants breathing too 
and i have heard  you knights of tyre
are excellent in making ladies trip 
and that their measures are as excellent 


pericles

in those that practise them they are  my lord 


simonides

o  that as much as you would be denied
of your fair courtesy 
the knights and ladies dance
unclasp  unclasp 
thanks  gentlemen  to all  all have done well 
to pericles
but you the best  pages and lights  to conduct
these knights unto their several lodgings 
to pericles
yours  sir 
we have given order to be next our own 


pericles

i am at your grace pleasure 


simonides

princes  it is too late to talk of love 
and that the mark i know you level at 
therefore each one betake him to his rest 
to morrow all for speeding do their best
