scene iv  tyre  a room in the governor house 


enter helicanus and escanes


helicanus

no  escanes  know this of me 
antiochus from incest lived not free 
for which  the most high gods not minding longer
to withhold the vengeance that they had in store 
due to this heinous capital offence 
even in the height and pride of all his glory 
when he was seated in a chariot
of an inestimable value  and his daughter with him 
a fire from heaven came and shrivell up
their bodies  even to loathing  for they so stunk 
that all those eyes adored them ere their fall
scorn now their hand should give them burial 


escanes

 very strange 


helicanus

and yet but justice  for though
this king were great  his greatness was no guard
to bar heaven shaft  but sin had his reward 


escanes

 very true 
enter two or three lords


first lord

see  not a man in private conference
or council has respect with him but he 


second lord

it shall no longer grieve without reproof 


third lord

and cursed be he that will not second it 


first lord

follow me  then  lord helicane  a word 


helicanus

with me  and welcome  happy day  my lords 


first lord

know that our griefs are risen to the top 
and now at length they overflow their banks 


helicanus

your griefs  for what  wrong not your prince you love 


first lord

wrong not yourself  then  noble helicane 
but if the prince do live  let us salute him 
or know what ground made happy by his breath 
if in the world he live  we seek him out 
if in his grave he rest  we find him there 
and be resolved he lives to govern us 
or dead  give cause to mourn his funeral 
and leave us to our free election 


second lord

whose death indeed the strongest in our censure 
and knowing this kingdom is without a head 
like goodly buildings left without a roof
soon fall to ruin your noble self 
that best know how to rule and how to reign 
we thus submit unto our sovereign 


all

live  noble helicane 


helicanus

for honour cause  forbear your suffrages 
if that you love prince pericles  forbear 
take i your wish  i leap into the seas 
where hourly trouble for a minute ease 
a twelvemonth longer  let me entreat you to
forbear the absence of your king 
if in which time expired  he not return 
i shall with aged patience bear your yoke 
but if i cannot win you to this love 
go search like nobles  like noble subjects 
and in your search spend your adventurous worth 
whom if you find  and win unto return 
you shall like diamonds sit about his crown 


first lord

to wisdom he a fool that will not yield 
and since lord helicane enjoineth us 
we with our travels will endeavour us 


helicanus

then you love us  we you  and we clasp hands 
when peers thus knit  a kingdom ever stands 
exeunt
