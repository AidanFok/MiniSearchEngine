which yet from her by no means can i get

not minding whether i dislike or no 
well  i do commend her choice 
and will no longer have it be delay d 
soft  here he comes  i must dissemble it 
enter pericles


pericles

all fortune to the good simonides 


simonides

to you as much  sir  i am beholding to you
for your sweet music this last night  i do
protest my ears were never better fed
with such delightful pleasing harmony 


pericles

it is your grace pleasure to commend 
not my desert 


simonides

sir  you are music master 


pericles

the worst of all her scholars  my good lord 


simonides

let me ask you one thing 
what do you think of my daughter  sir 


pericles

a most virtuous princess 


simonides

and she is fair too  is she not 


pericles

as a fair day in summer  wondrous fair 


simonides

sir  my daughter thinks very well of you 
ay  so well  that you must be her master 
and she will be your scholar  therefore look to it 


pericles

i am unworthy for her schoolmaster 


simonides

she thinks not so  peruse this writing else 


pericles

 aside   what here 
a letter  that she loves the knight of tyre 
 the king subtlety to have my life 
o  seek not to entrap me  gracious lord 
a stranger and distressed gentleman 
that never aim so high to love your daughter 
but bent all offices to honour her 


simonides

thou hast bewitch my daughter  and thou art
a villain 


pericles

by the gods  i have not 
never did thought of mine levy offence 
nor never did my actions yet commence
a deed might gain her love or your displeasure 


simonides

traitor  thou liest 


pericles

traitor 


simonides

ay  traitor 


pericles

even in his throat unless it be the king 
that calls me traitor  i return the lie 


simonides

 aside   now  by the gods  i do applaud his courage 


pericles

my actions are as noble as my thoughts 
that never relish of a base descent 
i came unto your court for honour cause 
and not to be a rebel to her state 
and he that otherwise accounts of me 
this sword shall prove he honour enemy 


simonides

no 
here comes my daughter  she can witness it 
enter thaisa


pericles

then  as you are as virtuous as fair 
resolve your angry father  if my tongue
did ere solicit  or my hand subscribe
to any syllable that made love to you 


thaisa

why  sir  say if you had 
who takes offence at that would make me glad 


simonides

yea  mistress  are you so peremptory 
aside
i am glad on with all my heart 
i tame you  i bring you in subjection 
will you  not having my consent 
bestow your love and your affections
upon a stranger 
aside
who  for aught i know 
may be  nor can i think the contrary 
as great in blood as i myself 
therefore hear you  mistress  either frame
your will to mine and you  sir  hear you 
either be ruled by me  or i will make you 
man and wife 
nay  come  your hands and lips must seal it too 
and being join d  i thus your hopes destroy 
and for a further grief god give you joy 
what  are you both pleased 


thaisa

yes  if you love me  sir 


pericles

even as my life  or blood that fosters it 


simonides

what  are you both agreed 


both

yes  if it please your majesty 


simonides

it pleaseth me so well  that i will see you wed 
and then with what haste you can get you to bed 
exeunt

enter gower


gower

now sleep y slaked hath the rout 
no din but snores the house about 
made louder by the o er fed breast
of this most pompous marriage feast 
the cat  with eyne of burning coal 
now crouches fore the mouse hole 
and crickets sing at the oven mouth 
e the blither for their drouth 
hymen hath brought the bride to bed 
where  by the loss of maidenhead 
a babe is moulded  be attent 
and time that is so briefly spent
with your fine fancies quaintly eche 
what dumb in show i plain with speech 
dumb show 
enter  pericles and simonides at one door  with  attendants  a messenger meets them  kneels  and  gives pericles a letter  pericles shows it  simonides  the lords kneel to him  then enter  thaisa with child  with lychorida a nurse  the  king shows her the letter  she rejoices  she and  pericles takes leave of her father  and depart with  lychorida and their attendants  then exeunt simonides and the rest
by many a dern and painful perch
of pericles the careful search 
by the four opposing coigns
which the world together joins 
is made with all due diligence
that horse and sail and high expense
can stead the quest  at last from tyre 
fame answering the most strange inquire 
to the court of king simonides
are letters brought  the tenor these 
antiochus and his daughter dead 
the men of tyrus on the head
of helicanus would set on
the crown of tyre  but he will none 
the mutiny he there hastes t  oppress 
says to  em  if king pericles
come not home in twice six moons 
he  obedient to their dooms 
will take the crown  the sum of this 
brought hither to pentapolis 
y ravished the regions round 
and every one with claps can sound 
 heir apparent is a king 
who dream d  who thought of such a thing 
brief  he must hence depart to tyre 
his queen with child makes her desire 
which who shall cross along to go 
omit we all their dole and woe 
lychorida  her nurse  she takes 
and so to sea  their vessel shakes
on neptune billow  half the flood
hath their keel cut  but fortune mood
varies again  the grisly north
disgorges such a tempest forth 
that  as a duck for life that dives 
so up and down the poor ship drives 
the lady shrieks  and well a near
does fall in travail with her fear 
and what ensues in this fell storm
shall for itself itself perform 
i nill relate  action may
conveniently the rest convey 
which might not what by me is told 
in your imagination hold
this stage the ship  upon whose deck
the sea tost pericles appears to speak 
exit
scene i 
enter pericles  on shipboard


pericles

thou god of this great vast  rebuke these surges 
which wash both heaven and hell  and thou  that hast
upon the winds command  bind them in brass 
having call them from the deep  o  still
thy deafening  dreadful thunders  gently quench
thy nimble  sulphurous flashes  o  how  lychorida 
how does my queen  thou stormest venomously 
wilt thou spit all thyself  the seaman whistle
is as a whisper in the ears of death 
unheard  lychorida lucina  o
divinest patroness  and midwife gentle
to those that cry by night  convey thy deity
aboard our dancing boat  make swift the pangs
of my queen travails 
enter lychorida  with an infant
now  lychorida 


lychorida

here is a thing too young for such a place 
who  if it had conceit  would die  as i
am like to do  take in your arms this piece
of your dead queen 


pericles

how  how  lychorida 


lychorida

patience  good sir  do not assist the storm 
here all that is left living of your queen 
a little daughter  for the sake of it 
be manly  and take comfort 


pericles

o you gods 
why do you make us love your goodly gifts 
and snatch them straight away  we here below
recall not what we give  and therein may
use honour with you 


lychorida

patience  good sir 
even for this charge 


pericles

now  mild may be thy life 
for a more blustrous birth had never babe 
quiet and gentle thy conditions  for
thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
that ever was prince child  happy what follows 
thou hast as chiding a nativity
as fire  air  water  earth  and heaven can make 
to herald thee from the womb  even at the first
thy loss is more than can thy portage quit 
with all thou canst find here  now  the good gods
throw their best eyes upon t 
enter two sailors


first sailor

what courage  sir  god save you 


pericles

courage enough  i do not fear the flaw 
it hath done to me the worst  yet  for the love
of this poor infant  this fresh new sea farer 
i would it would be quiet 


first sailor

slack the bolins there  thou wilt not  wilt thou 
blow  and split thyself 


second sailor

but sea room  an the brine and cloudy billow kiss
the moon  i care not 


first sailor

sir  your queen must overboard  the sea works high 
the wind is loud  and will not lie till the ship be
cleared of the dead 


pericles

that your superstition 


first sailor

pardon us  sir  with us at sea it hath been still
observed  and we are strong in custom  therefore
briefly yield her  for she must overboard straight 


pericles

as you think meet  most wretched queen 


lychorida

here she lies  sir 


pericles

a terrible childbed hast thou had  my dear 
no light  no fire  the unfriendly elements
forgot thee utterly  nor have i time
to give thee hallow to thy grave  but straight
must cast thee  scarcely coffin d  in the ooze 
where  for a monument upon thy bones 
and e er remaining lamps  the belching whale
and humming water must o thy corpse 
lying with simple shells  o lychorida 
bid nestor bring me spices  ink and paper 
my casket and my jewels  and bid nicander
bring me the satin coffer  lay the babe
upon the pillow  hie thee  whiles i say
a priestly farewell to her  suddenly  woman 
exit lychorida


second sailor

sir  we have a chest beneath the hatches  caulked
and bitumed ready 


pericles

i thank thee  mariner  say what coast is this 


second sailor

we are near tarsus 


pericles

thither  gentle mariner 
alter thy course for tyre  when canst thou reach it 


second sailor

by break of day  if the wind cease 


pericles

o  make for tarsus 
there will i visit cleon  for the babe
cannot hold out to tyrus  there i leave it
at careful nursing  go thy ways  good mariner 
i bring the body presently
