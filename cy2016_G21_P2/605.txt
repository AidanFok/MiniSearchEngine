enter pericles  cleon  dionyza  and lychorida with marina in her arms


pericles

 most honour cleon  i must needs be gone 
my twelve months are expired  and tyrus stands
in a litigious peace  you  and your lady 
take from my heart all thankfulness  the gods
make up the rest upon you 


cleon

your shafts of fortune  though they hurt you mortally 
yet glance full wanderingly on us 


dionyza

o your sweet queen 
that the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither 
to have bless mine eyes with her 


pericles

we cannot but obey
the powers above us  could i rage and roar
as doth the sea she lies in  yet the end
must be as  tis  my gentle babe marina  whom 
for she was born at sea  i have named so  here
i charge your charity withal  leaving her
the infant of your care  beseeching you
to give her princely training  that she may be
manner as she is born 


cleon

fear not  my lord  but think
your grace  that fed my country with your corn 
for which the people prayers still fall upon you 
must in your child be thought on  if neglection
should therein make me vile  the common body 
by you relieved  would force me to my duty 
but if to that my nature need a spur 
the gods revenge it upon me and mine 
to the end of generation 


pericles

i believe you 
your honour and your goodness teach me to t 
without your vows  till she be married  madam 
by bright diana  whom we honour  all
unscissor shall this hair of mine remain 
though i show ill in t  so i take my leave 
good madam  make me blessed in your care
in bringing up my child 


dionyza

i have one myself 
who shall not be more dear to my respect
than yours  my lord 


pericles

madam  my thanks and prayers 


cleon

we bring your grace e to the edge o  the shore 
then give you up to the mask neptune and
the gentlest winds of heaven 


pericles

i will embrace
your offer  come  dearest madam  o  no tears 
lychorida  no tears 
look to your little mistress  on whose grace
you may depend hereafter  come  my lord 
exeunt
