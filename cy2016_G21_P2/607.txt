scene i  tarsus  an open place near the sea shore 


enter dionyza and leonine


dionyza

thy oath remember  thou hast sworn to do t 
 but a blow  which never shall be known 
thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon 
to yield thee so much profit  let not conscience 
which is but cold  inflaming love i  thy bosom 
inflame too nicely  nor let pity  which
even women have cast off  melt thee  but be
a soldier to thy purpose 


leonine

i will do t  but yet she is a goodly creature 


dionyza

the fitter  then  the gods should have her  here
she comes weeping for her only mistress  death 
thou art resolved 


leonine

i am resolved 
enter marina  with a basket of flowers


marina

no  i will rob tellus of her weed 
to strew thy green with flowers  the yellows  blues 
the purple violets  and marigolds 
shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave 
while summer days do last  ay me  poor maid 
born in a tempest  when my mother died 
this world to me is like a lasting storm 
whirring me from my friends 


dionyza

how now  marina  why do you keep alone 
how chance my daughter is not with you  do not
consume your blood with sorrowing  you have
a nurse of me  lord  how your favour changed
with this unprofitable woe 
come  give me your flowers  ere the sea mar it 
walk with leonine  the air is quick there 
and it pierces and sharpens the stomach  come 
leonine  take her by the arm  walk with her 


marina

no  i pray you 
i not bereave you of your servant 


dionyza

come  come 
i love the king your father  and yourself 
with more than foreign heart  we every day
expect him here  when he shall come and find
our paragon to all reports thus blasted 
he will repent the breadth of his great voyage 
blame both my lord and me  that we have taken
no care to your best courses  go  i pray you 
walk  and be cheerful once again  reserve
that excellent complexion  which did steal
the eyes of young and old  care not for me
i can go home alone 


marina

well  i will go 
but yet i have no desire to it 


dionyza

come  come  i know  good for you 
walk half an hour  leonine  at the least 
remember what i have said 


leonine

i warrant you  madam 


dionyza

i leave you  my sweet lady  for a while 
pray  walk softly  do not heat your blood 
what  i must have a care of you 


marina

my thanks  sweet madam 
exit dionyza
is this wind westerly that blows 


leonine

south west 


marina

when i was born  the wind was north 


leonine

was so 


marina

my father  as nurse said  did never fear 
but cried  seaman  to the sailors  galling
his kingly hands  haling ropes 
and  clasping to the mast  endured a sea
that almost burst the deck 


leonine

when was this 


marina

when i was born 
never was waves nor wind more violent 
and from the ladder tackle washes off
a canvas climber   ha  says one   out 
and with a dropping industry they skip
from stem to stern  the boatswain whistles  and
the master calls  and trebles their confusion 


leonine

come  say your prayers 


marina

what mean you 


leonine

if you require a little space for prayer 
i grant it  pray  but be not tedious 
for the gods are quick of ear  and i am sworn
to do my work with haste 


marina

why will you kill me 


leonine

to satisfy my lady 


marina

why would she have me kill d 
now  as i can remember  by my troth 
i never did her hurt in all my life 
i never spake bad word  nor did ill turn
to any living creature  believe me  la 
i never kill a mouse  nor hurt a fly 
i trod upon a worm against my will 
but i wept for it  how have i offended 
wherein my death might yield her any profit 
or my life imply her any danger 


leonine

my commission
is not to reason of the deed  but do it 


marina

you will not do for all the world  i hope 
you are well favour d  and your looks foreshow
you have a gentle heart  i saw you lately 
when you caught hurt in parting two that fought 
good sooth  it show well in you  do so now 
your lady seeks my life  come you between 
and save poor me  the weaker 


leonine

i am sworn 
and will dispatch 
he seizes her
enter pirates


first pirate

hold  villain 
leonine runs away


second pirate

a prize  a prize 


third pirate

half part  mates  half part 
come  let have her aboard suddenly 
exeunt pirates with marina
re enter leonine


leonine

these roguing thieves serve the great pirate valdes 
and they have seized marina  let her go 
there no hope she will return  i swear
she dead 
and thrown into the sea  but i see further 
perhaps they will but please themselves upon her 
not carry her aboard  if she remain 
whom they have ravish must by me be slain
