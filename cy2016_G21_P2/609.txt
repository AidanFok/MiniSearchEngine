scene iii  tarsus  a room in cleon house 


enter cleon and dionyza


dionyza

why  are you foolish  can it be undone 


cleon

o dionyza  such a piece of slaughter
the sun and moon ne look upon 


dionyza

i think
you turn a child again 


cleon

were i chief lord of all this spacious world 
i give it to undo the deed  o lady 
much less in blood than virtue  yet a princess
to equal any single crown o  the earth
i  the justice of compare  o villain leonine 
whom thou hast poison too 
if thou hadst drunk to him   had been a kindness
becoming well thy fact  what canst thou say
when noble pericles shall demand his child 


dionyza

that she is dead  nurses are not the fates 
to foster it  nor ever to preserve 
she died at night  i say so  who can cross it 
unless you play the pious innocent 
and for an honest attribute cry out
 died by foul play 


cleon

o  go to  well  well 
of all the faults beneath the heavens  the gods
do like this worst 


dionyza

be one of those that think
the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence 
and open this to pericles  i do shame
to think of what a noble strain you are 
and of how coward a spirit 


cleon

to such proceeding
who ever but his approbation added 
though not his prime consent  he did not flow
from honourable sources 


dionyza

be it so  then 
yet none does know  but you  how she came dead 
nor none can know  leonine being gone 
she did disdain my child  and stood between
her and her fortunes  none would look on her 
but cast their gazes on marina face 
whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
not worth the time of day  it pierced me through 
and though you call my course unnatural 
you not your child well loving  yet i find
it greets me as an enterprise of kindness
perform to your sole daughter 


cleon

heavens forgive it 


dionyza

and as for pericles 
what should he say  we wept after her hearse 
and yet we mourn  her monument
is almost finish d  and her epitaphs
in glittering golden characters express
a general praise to her  and care in us
at whose expense  done 


cleon

thou art like the harpy 
which  to betray  dost  with thine angel face 
seize with thine eagle talons 


dionyza

you are like one that superstitiously
doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies 
but yet i know you do as i advise 
exeunt
scene iv 
enter gower  before the monument of marina at tarsus


gower

thus time we waste  and longest leagues make short 
sail seas in cockles  have an wish but for t 
making  to take your imagination 
from bourn to bourn  region to region 
by you being pardon d  we commit no crime
to use one language in each several clime
where our scenes seem to live  i do beseech you
to learn of me  who stand i  the gaps to teach you 
the stages of our story  pericles
is now again thwarting the wayward seas 
attended on by many a lord and knight 
to see his daughter  all his life delight 
old escanes  whom helicanus late
advanced in time to great and high estate 
is left to govern  bear you it in mind 
old helicanus goes along behind 
well sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
this king to tarsus think his pilot thought 
so with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on 
to fetch his daughter home  who first is gone 
like motes and shadows see them move awhile 
your ears unto your eyes i reconcile 
dumb show 
enter pericles  at one door  with all his train   cleon and dionyza  at the other  cleon shows  pericles the tomb  whereat pericles makes  lamentation  puts on sackcloth  and in a mighty passion departs  then exeunt cleon and dionyza
see how belief may suffer by foul show 
this borrow passion stands for true old woe 
and pericles  in sorrow all devour d 
with sighs shot through  and biggest tears
o ershower d 
leaves tarsus and again embarks  he swears
never to wash his face  nor cut his hairs 
he puts on sackcloth  and to sea  he bears
a tempest  which his mortal vessel tears 
and yet he rides it out  now please you wit 
the epitaph is for marina writ
by wicked dionyza 
reads the inscription on marina monument
 fairest  sweet st  and best lies here 
who wither in her spring of year 
she was of tyrus the king daughter 
on whom foul death hath made this slaughter 
marina was she call d  and at her birth 
thetis  being proud  swallow some part o  the earth 
therefore the earth  fearing to be o erflow d 
hath thetis  birth child on the heavens bestow d 
wherefore she does  and swears she never stint 
make raging battery upon shores of flint 
no visor does become black villany
so well as soft and tender flattery 
let pericles believe his daughter dead 
and bear his courses to be ordered
by lady fortune  while our scene must play
his daughter woe and heavy well a day
in her unholy service  patience  then 
and think you now are all in mytilene 
exit
