and to our purposes he lives no more 
lord chief justice	i would his majesty had call me with him 
the service that i truly did his life
hath left me open to all injuries 


warwick

indeed i think the young king loves you not 
lord chief justice	i know he doth not  and do arm myself
to welcome the condition of the time 
which cannot look more hideously upon me
than i have drawn it in my fantasy

clarence

good morrow  cousin 


lancaster

we meet like men that had forgot to speak 


warwick

we do remember  but our argument
is all too heavy to admit much talk 


lancaster

well  peace be with him that hath made us heavy 
lord chief justice	peace be with us  lest we be heavier 


gloucester

o  good my lord  you have lost a friend indeed 
and i dare swear you borrow not that face
of seeming sorrow  it is sure your own 


lancaster

though no man be assured what grace to find 
you stand in coldest expectation 
i am the sorrier  would  otherwise 


clarence

well  you must now speak sir john falstaff fair 
which swims against your stream of quality 
lord chief justice	sweet princes  what i did  i did in honour 
led by the impartial conduct of my soul 
and never shall you see that i will beg
a ragged and forestall remission 
if truth and upright innocency fail me 
i to the king my master that is dead 
and tell him who hath sent me after him 


warwick

here comes the prince 
enter king henry v  attended
lord chief justice	good morrow  and god save your majesty 


king henry v

this new and gorgeous garment  majesty 
sits not so easy on me as you think 
brothers  you mix your sadness with some fear 
this is the english  not the turkish court 
not amurath an amurath succeeds 
but harry harry  yet be sad  good brothers 
for  by my faith  it very well becomes you 
sorrow so royally in you appears
that i will deeply put the fashion on
and wear it in my heart  why then  be sad 
but entertain no more of it  good brothers 
than a joint burden laid upon us all 
for me  by heaven  i bid you be assured 
i be your father and your brother too 
let me but bear your love  i  bear your cares 
yet weep that harry dead  and so will i 
but harry lives  that shall convert those tears
by number into hours of happiness 


princes

we hope no other from your majesty 


king henry v

you all look strangely on me  and you most 
you are  i think  assured i love you not 
lord chief justice	i am assured  if i be measured rightly 
your majesty hath no just cause to hate me 


king henry v

no 
how might a prince of my great hopes forget
so great indignities you laid upon me 
what  rate  rebuke  and roughly send to prison
the immediate heir of england  was this easy 
may this be wash in lethe  and forgotten 
lord chief justice	i then did use the person of your father 
the image of his power lay then in me 
and  in the administration of his law 
whiles i was busy for the commonwealth 
your highness pleased to forget my place 
the majesty and power of law and justice 
the image of the king whom i presented 
and struck me in my very seat of judgment 
whereon  as an offender to your father 
i gave bold way to my authority
and did commit you  if the deed were ill 
be you contented  wearing now the garland 
to have a son set your decrees at nought 
to pluck down justice from your awful bench 
to trip the course of law and blunt the sword
that guards the peace and safety of your person 
nay  more  to spurn at your most royal image
and mock your workings in a second body 
question your royal thoughts  make the case yours 
be now the father and propose a son 
hear your own dignity so much profaned 
see your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted 
behold yourself so by a son disdain d 
and then imagine me taking your part
and in your power soft silencing your son 
after this cold considerance  sentence me 
and  as you are a king  speak in your state
what i have done that misbecame my place 
my person  or my liege sovereignty 


king henry v

you are right  justice  and you weigh this well 
therefore still bear the balance and the sword 
and i do wish your honours may increase 
till you do live to see a son of mine
offend you and obey you  as i did 
so shall i live to speak my father words 
 am i  that have a man so bold 
that dares do justice on my proper son 
and not less happy  having such a son 
that would deliver up his greatness so
into the hands of justice  you did commit me 
for which  i do commit into your hand
the unstained sword that you have used to bear 
with this remembrance  that you use the same
with the like bold  just and impartial spirit
as you have done  me  there is my hand 
you shall be as a father to my youth 
my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear 
and i will stoop and humble my intents
to your well practised wise directions 
and  princes all  believe me  i beseech you 
my father is gone wild into his grave 
for in his tomb lie my affections 
and with his spirit sadly i survive 
to mock the expectation of the world 
to frustrate prophecies and to raze out
rotten opinion  who hath writ me down
after my seeming  the tide of blood in me
hath proudly flow in vanity till now 
now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea 
where it shall mingle with the state of floods
and flow henceforth in formal majesty 
now call we our high court of parliament 
and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel 
that the great body of our state may go
in equal rank with the best govern nation 
that war  or peace  or both at once  may be
as things acquainted and familiar to us 
in which you  father  shall have foremost hand 
our coronation done  we will accite 
as i before remember d  all our state 
and  god consigning to my good intents 
no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say 
god shorten harry happy life one day 
exeunt
