fie  fie upon her  she able to freeze the god
priapus  and undo a whole generation  we must
either get her ravished  or be rid of her  when she
should do for clients her fitment  and do me the
kindness of our profession  she has me her quirks 
her reasons  her master reasons  her prayers  her
knees  that she would make a puritan of the devil 
if he should cheapen a kiss of her

of all our cavaliers  and make our swearers priests

lysimachus

what  prithee 


boult

o  sir  i can be modest 


lysimachus

that dignifies the renown of a bawd  no less than it
gives a good report to a number to be chaste

bawd

here comes that which grows to the stalk  never
plucked yet  i can assure you

lysimachus

how long have you been of this profession 


marina

e since i can remember 


lysimachus

did you go to  so young  were you a gamester at
five or at seven 


marina

earlier too  sir  if now i be one 


lysimachus

why  the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a
creature of sale 


marina

do you know this house to be a place of such resort 
and will come into  t  i hear say you are of
honourable parts  and are the governor of this place 


lysimachus

why  hath your principal made known unto you who i am 


marina

who is my principal 


lysimachus

why  your herb woman  she that sets seeds and roots
of shame and iniquity  o  you have heard something
of my power  and so stand aloof for more serious
wooing  but i protest to thee  pretty one  my
authority shall not see thee  or else look friendly
upon thee  come  bring me to some private place 
come  come

that thought you worthy of it 


lysimachus

how this  how this  some more  be sage 


marina

for me 
that am a maid  though most ungentle fortune
have placed me in this sty  where  since i came 
diseases have been sold dearer than physic 
o  that the gods
would set me free from this unhallow place 
though they did change me to the meanest bird
that flies i  the purer air 


lysimachus

i did not think
thou couldst have spoke so well  ne dream thou couldst 
had i brought hither a corrupted mind 
thy speech had alter it  hold  here gold for thee 
persever in that clear way thou goest 
and the gods strengthen thee 


marina

the good gods preserve you 


lysimachus

for me  be you thoughten
that i came with no ill intent  for to me
the very doors and windows savour vilely 
fare thee well  thou art a piece of virtue  and
i doubt not but thy training hath been noble 
hold  here more gold for thee 
a curse upon him  die he like a thief 
that robs thee of thy goodness  if thou dost
hear from me  it shall be for thy good 
re enter boult


boult

i beseech your honour  one piece for me 


lysimachus

avaunt  thou damned door keeper 
your house  but for this virgin that doth prop it 
would sink and overwhelm you  away 
exit


boult

how this  we must take another course with you 
if your peevish chastity  which is not worth a
breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope 
shall undo a whole household  let me be gelded like
a spaniel  come your ways 


marina

 whither would you have me 


boult

i must have your maidenhead taken off  or the common
hangman shall execute it  come your ways  we 
have no more gentlemen driven away  come your ways  i say 
re enter bawd


bawd

how now  what the matter 


boult

worse and worse  mistress  she has here spoken holy
words to the lord lysimachus 


bawd

o abominable 


boult

she makes our profession as it were to stink afore
the face of the gods 


bawd

marry  hang her up for ever 


boult

the nobleman would have dealt with her like a
nobleman  and she sent him away as cold as a
snowball  saying his prayers too 


bawd

boult  take her away  use her at thy pleasure 
crack the glass of her virginity  and make the rest malleable 


boult

an if she were a thornier piece of ground than she
is  she shall be ploughed 


marina

hark  hark  you gods 


bawd

she conjures  away with her  would she had never
come within my doors  marry  hang you  she born
to undo us  will you not go the way of women kind 
marry  come up  my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays 
exit


boult

come  mistress  come your ways with me 


marina

whither wilt thou have me 


boult

to take from you the jewel you hold so dear 


marina

prithee  tell me one thing first 


boult

come now  your one thing 


marina

what canst thou wish thine enemy to be 


boult

why  i could wish him to be my master  or rather  my mistress 


marina

neither of these are so bad as thou art 
since they do better thee in their command 
thou hold a place  for which the pained fiend
of hell would not in reputation change 
thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
coistrel that comes inquiring for his tib 
to the choleric fisting of every rogue
thy ear is liable  thy food is such
as hath been belch on by infected lungs 


boult

what would you have me do  go to the wars  would
you  where a man may serve seven years for the loss
of a leg  and have not money enough in the end to
buy him a wooden one 


marina

do any thing but this thou doest  empty
old receptacles  or common shores  of filth 
serve by indenture to the common hangman 
any of these ways are yet better than this 
for what thou professest  a baboon  could he speak 
would own a name too dear  o  that the gods
would safely deliver me from this place 
here  here gold for thee 
if that thy master would gain by thee 
proclaim that i can sing  weave  sew  and dance 
with other virtues  which i keep from boast 
and i will undertake all these to teach 
i doubt not but this populous city will
yield many scholars 


boult

but can you teach all this you speak of 


marina

prove that i cannot  take me home again 
and prostitute me to the basest groom
that doth frequent your house 


boult

well  i will see what i can do for thee  if i can
place thee  i will 


marina

but amongst honest women 


boult

 faith  my acquaintance lies little amongst them 
but since my master and mistress have bought you 
there no going but by their consent  therefore i
will make them acquainted with your purpose  and i
doubt not but i shall find them tractable enough 
come  i do for thee what i can  come your ways 
exeunt

enter gower


gower

marina thus the brothel  scapes  and chances
into an honest house  our story says 
she sings like one immortal  and she dances
as goddess like to her admired lays 
deep clerks she dumbs  and with her needle composes
nature own shape  of bud  bird  branch  or berry 
that even her art sisters the natural roses 
her inkle  silk  twin with the rubied cherry 
that pupils lacks she none of noble race 
who pour their bounty on her  and her gain
she gives the cursed bawd  here we her place 
and to her father turn our thoughts again 
where we left him  on the sea  we there him lost 
whence  driven before the winds  he is arrived
here where his daughter dwells  and on this coast
suppose him now at anchor  the city strived
god neptune annual feast to keep  from whence
lysimachus our tyrian ship espies 
his banners sable  trimm with rich expense 
and to him in his barge with fervor hies 
in your supposing once more put your sight
of heavy pericles  think this his bark 
where what is done in action  more  if might 
shall be discover d  please you  sit and hark
