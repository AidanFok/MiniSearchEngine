helicanus

sir 
our vessel is of tyre  in it the king 
a man who for this three months hath not spoken
to any one  nor taken sustenance
but to prorogue his grief 


lysimachus

upon what ground is his distemperature 


helicanus

 be too tedious to repeat 
but the main grief springs from the loss
of a beloved daughter and a wife 


lysimachus

may we not see him 


helicanus

you may 
but bootless is your sight  he will not speak to any 


lysimachus

yet let me obtain my wish 


helicanus

behold him 
pericles discovered
this was a goodly person 
till the disaster that  one mortal night 
drove him to this

helicanus

it is in vain  he will not speak to you

sir 
we have a maid in mytilene  i durst wager 
would win some words of him 


lysimachus

 well bethought 
she questionless with her sweet harmony
and other chosen attractions  would allure 
and make a battery through his deafen parts 
which now are midway stopp d 
she is all happy as the fairest of all 
and  with her fellow maids is now upon
the leafy shelter that abuts against
the island side 
whispers a lord  who goes off in the barge of lysimachus


helicanus

sure  all effectless  yet nothing we omit
that bears recovery name  but  since your kindness
we have stretch thus far  let us beseech you
that for our gold we may provision have 
wherein we are not destitute for want 
but weary for the staleness 


lysimachus

o  sir  a courtesy
which if we should deny  the most just gods
for every graff would send a caterpillar 
and so afflict our province  yet once more
let me entreat to know at large the cause
of your king sorrow 


helicanus

sit  sir  i will recount it to you 
but  see  i am prevented 
re enter  from the barge  lord  with marina  and a young lady


lysimachus

o  here is
the lady that i sent for  welcome  fair one 
is not a goodly presence 


helicanus

she a gallant lady 


lysimachus

she such a one  that  were i well assured
came of a gentle kind and noble stock 
i wish no better choice  and think me rarely wed 
fair one  all goodness that consists in bounty
expect even here  where is a kingly patient 
if that thy prosperous and artificial feat
can draw him but to answer thee in aught 
thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
as thy desires can wish 


marina

sir  i will use
my utmost skill in his recovery  provided
that none but i and my companion maid
be suffer to come near him 


lysimachus

come  let us leave her 
and the gods make her prosperous 
marina sings


lysimachus

mark he your music 


marina

no  nor look on us 


lysimachus

see  she will speak to him 


marina

hail  sir  my lord  lend ear 


pericles

hum  ha 


marina

i am a maid 
my lord  that ne before invited eyes 
but have been gazed on like a comet  she speaks 
my lord  that  may be  hath endured a grief
might equal yours  if both were justly weigh d 
though wayward fortune did malign my state 
my derivation was from ancestors
who stood equivalent with mighty kings 
but time hath rooted out my parentage 
and to the world and awkward casualties
bound me in servitude 
aside
i will desist 
but there is something glows upon my cheek 
and whispers in mine ear   not till he speak 


pericles

my fortunes parentage good parentage 
to equal mine was it not thus  what say you 


marina

i said  my lord  if you did know my parentage 
you would not do me violence 


pericles

i do think so  pray you  turn your eyes upon me 
you are like something that what country woman 
here of these shores 


marina

no  nor of any shores 
yet i was mortally brought forth  and am
no other than i appear 


pericles

i am great with woe  and shall deliver weeping 
my dearest wife was like this maid  and such a one
my daughter might have been  my queen square brows 
her stature to an inch  as wand like straight 
as silver voiced  her eyes as jewel like
and cased as richly  in pace another juno 
who starves the ears she feeds  and makes them hungry 
the more she gives them speech  where do you live 


marina

where i am but a stranger  from the deck
you may discern the place 


pericles

where were you bred 
and how achieved you these endowments  which
you make more rich to owe 


marina

if i should tell my history  it would seem
like lies disdain in the reporting 


pericles

prithee  speak 
falseness cannot come from thee  for thou look 
modest as justice  and thou seem a palace
for the crown truth to dwell in  i will
believe thee 
and make my senses credit thy relation
to points that seem impossible  for thou look 
like one i loved indeed  what were thy friends 
didst thou not say  when i did push thee back 
which was when i perceived thee that thou camest
from good descending 


marina

so indeed i did 


pericles

report thy parentage  i think thou said 
thou hadst been toss from wrong to injury 
and that thou thought thy griefs might equal mine 
if both were open d 


marina

some such thing
i said  and said no more but what my thoughts
did warrant me was likely 


pericles

tell thy story 
if thine consider prove the thousandth part
of my endurance  thou art a man  and i
have suffer like a girl  yet thou dost look
like patience gazing on kings  graves  and smiling
extremity out of act  what were thy friends 
how lost thou them  thy name  my most kind virgin 
recount  i do beseech thee  come  sit by me 


marina

my name is marina 


pericles

                  o  i am mock d 
and thou by some incensed god sent hither
to make the world to laugh at me 


marina

patience  good sir 
or here i cease 


pericles

nay  i be patient 
thou little know how thou dost startle me 
to call thyself marina 


marina

the name
was given me by one that had some power 
my father  and a king 


pericles

how  a king daughter 
and call marina 


marina

                  you said you would believe me 
but  not to be a troubler of your peace 
i will end here 


pericles

                  but are you flesh and blood 
have you a working pulse  and are no fairy 
motion  well  speak on  where were you born 
and wherefore call marina 


marina

call marina
for i was born at sea 


pericles

at sea  what mother 


marina

my mother was the daughter of a king 
who died the minute i was born 
as my good nurse lychorida hath oft
deliver weeping 


pericles

                  o  stop there a little 
aside
this is the rarest dream that e dull sleep
did mock sad fools withal  this cannot be 
my daughter buried  well  where were you bred 
i hear you more  to the bottom of your story 
and never interrupt you 


marina

you scorn  believe me   best i did give o er 


pericles

i will believe you by the syllable
of what you shall deliver  yet  give me leave 
how came you in these parts  where were you bred 


marina

the king my father did in tarsus leave me 
till cruel cleon  with his wicked wife 
did seek to murder me  and having woo 
a villain to attempt it  who having drawn to do t 
a crew of pirates came and rescued me 
brought me to mytilene  but  good sir 
whither will you have me  why do you weep 
it may be 
you think me an impostor  no  good faith 
i am the daughter to king pericles 
if good king pericles be 


pericles

ho  helicanus 


helicanus

calls my lord 


pericles

thou art a grave and noble counsellor 
most wise in general  tell me  if thou canst 
what this maid is  or what is like to be 
that thus hath made me weep 


helicanus

i know not  but
here is the regent  sir  of mytilene
speaks nobly of her 


lysimachus

she would never tell
her parentage  being demanded that 
she would sit still and weep 


pericles

o helicanus  strike me  honour sir 
give me a gash  put me to present pain 
lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
o the shores of my mortality 
and drown me with their sweetness  o  come hither 
thou that beget him that did thee beget 
thou that wast born at sea  buried at tarsus 
and found at sea again  o helicanus 
down on thy knees  thank the holy gods as loud
as thunder threatens us  this is marina 
what was thy mother name  tell me but that 
for truth can never be confirm enough 
though doubts did ever sleep 


marina

first  sir  i pray 
what is your title 


pericles

i am pericles of tyre  but tell me now
my drown queen name  as in the rest you said
thou hast been godlike perfect 
the heir of kingdoms and another like
to pericles thy father 


marina

is it no more to be your daughter than
to say my mother name was thaisa 
thaisa was my mother  who did end
the minute i began 


pericles

now  blessing on thee  rise  thou art my child 
give me fresh garments  mine own  helicanus 
she is not dead at tarsus  as she should have been 
by savage cleon  she shall tell thee all 
when thou shalt kneel  and justify in knowledge
she is thy very princess  who is this 


helicanus

sir   the governor of mytilene 
who  hearing of your melancholy state 
did come to see you 


pericles

i embrace you 
give me my robes  i am wild in my beholding 
o heavens bless my girl  but  hark  what music 
tell helicanus  my marina  tell him
o er  point by point  for yet he seems to doubt 
how sure you are my daughter  but  what music 


helicanus

my lord  i hear none 


pericles

none 
the music of the spheres  list  my marina 


lysimachus

it is not good to cross him  give him way 


pericles

rarest sounds  do ye not hear 


lysimachus

my lord  i hear 
music


pericles

most heavenly music 
it nips me unto listening  and thick slumber
hangs upon mine eyes  let me rest 
sleeps


lysimachus

a pillow for his head 
so  leave him all  well  my companion friends 
if this but answer to my just belief 
i well remember you 
exeunt all but pericles
diana appears to pericles as in a vision


diana

my temple stands in ephesus  hie thee thither 
and do upon mine altar sacrifice 
there  when my maiden priests are met together 
before the people all 
reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife 
to mourn thy crosses  with thy daughter s  call
and give them repetition to the life 
or perform my bidding  or thou livest in woe 
do it  and happy  by my silver bow 
awake  and tell thy dream 
disappears


pericles

celestial dian  goddess argentine 
i will obey thee  helicanus 
re enter helicanus  lysimachus  and marina


helicanus

sir 


pericles

my purpose was for tarsus  there to strike
the inhospitable cleon  but i am
for other service first  toward ephesus
turn our blown sails  eftsoons i tell thee why 
to lysimachus
shall we refresh us  sir  upon your shore 
and give you gold for such provision
as our intents will need 


lysimachus

sir 
with all my heart  and  when you come ashore 
i have another suit 


pericles

you shall prevail 
were it to woo my daughter  for it seems
you have been noble towards her 


lysimachus

sir  lend me your arm 


pericles

come  my marina 
exeunt
scene ii 
enter gower  before the temple of diana at ephesus


gower

now our sands are almost run 
more a little  and then dumb 
this  my last boon  give me 
for such kindness must relieve me 
that you aptly will suppose
what pageantry  what feats  what shows 
what minstrelsy  and pretty din 
the regent made in mytilene
to greet the king  so he thrived 
that he is promised to be wived
to fair marina  but in no wise
till he had done his sacrifice 
as dian bade  whereto being bound 
the interim  pray you  all confound 
in feather briefness sails are fill d 
and wishes fall out as they will d 
at ephesus  the temple see 
our king and all his company 
that he can hither come so soon 
is by your fancy thankful doom 
exit
