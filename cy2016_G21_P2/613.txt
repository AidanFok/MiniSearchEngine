i here confess myself the king of tyre 
who  frighted from my country  did wed
at pentapolis the fair thaisa 
at sea in childbed died she  but brought forth
a maid child call marina  who  o goddess 
wears yet thy silver livery  she at tarsus
was nursed with cleon  who at fourteen years
he sought to murder  but her better stars
brought her to mytilene   whose shore
riding  her fortunes brought the maid aboard us 
where  by her own most clear remembrance  she
made known herself my daughter

                  reverend appearer  no 
i threw her overboard with these very arms 


cerimon

upon this coast  i warrant you 


pericles

 most certain 


cerimon

look to the lady  o  she but o erjoy d 
early in blustering morn this lady was
thrown upon this shore  i oped the coffin 
found there rich jewels  recover her  and placed her
here in diana temple 


pericles

may we see them 


cerimon

great sir  they shall be brought you to my house 
whither i invite you  look  thaisa is recovered 


thaisa

o  let me look 
if he be none of mine  my sanctity
will to my sense bend no licentious ear 
but curb it  spite of seeing  o  my lord 
are you not pericles  like him you spake 
like him you are  did you not name a tempest 
a birth  and death 


pericles

the voice of dead thaisa 


thaisa

that thaisa am i  supposed dead
and drown d 


pericles

immortal dian 


thaisa

                  now i know you better 
when we with tears parted pentapolis 
the king my father gave you such a ring 
shows a ring


pericles

this  this  no more  you gods  your present kindness
makes my past miseries sports  you shall do well 
that on the touching of her lips i may
melt and no more be seen  o  come  be buried
a second time within these arms 


marina

my heart
leaps to be gone into my mother bosom 
kneels to thaisa


pericles

look  who kneels here  flesh of thy flesh  thaisa 
thy burden at the sea  and call marina
for she was yielded there 


thaisa

blest  and mine own 


helicanus

hail  madam  and my queen 


thaisa

i know you not 


pericles

you have heard me say  when i did fly from tyre 
i left behind an ancient substitute 
can you remember what i call the man 
i have named him oft 


thaisa

 helicanus then 


pericles

still confirmation 
embrace him  dear thaisa  this is he 
now do i long to hear how you were found 
how possibly preserved  and who to thank 
besides the gods  for this great miracle 


thaisa

lord cerimon  my lord  this man 
through whom the gods have shown their power  that can
from first to last resolve you 


pericles

reverend sir 
the gods can have no mortal officer
more like a god than you  will you deliver
how this dead queen re lives 


cerimon

i will  my lord 
beseech you  first go with me to my house 
where shall be shown you all was found with her 
how she came placed here in the temple 
no needful thing omitted 


pericles

pure dian  bless thee for thy vision  i
will offer night oblations to thee  thaisa 
this prince  the fair betrothed of your daughter 
shall marry her at pentapolis  and now 
this ornament
makes me look dismal will i clip to form 
and what this fourteen years no razor touch d 
to grace thy marriage day  i beautify 


thaisa

lord cerimon hath letters of good credit  sir 
my father dead 


pericles

heavens make a star of him  yet there  my queen 
we celebrate their nuptials  and ourselves
will in that kingdom spend our following days 
our son and daughter shall in tyrus reign 
lord cerimon  we do our longing stay
to hear the rest untold  sir  lead the way 
exeunt
enter gower


gower

in antiochus and his daughter you have heard
of monstrous lust the due and just reward 
in pericles  his queen and daughter  seen 
although assail with fortune fierce and keen 
virtue preserved from fell destruction blast 
led on by heaven  and crown with joy at last 
in helicanus may you well descry
a figure of truth  of faith  of loyalty 
in reverend cerimon there well appears
the worth that learned charity aye wears 
for wicked cleon and his wife  when fame
had spread their cursed deed  and honour name
of pericles  to rage the city turn 
that him and his they in his palace burn 
the gods for murder seemed so content
to punish them  although not done  but meant 
so  on your patience evermore attending 
new joy wait on you  here our play has ending 
exit
