scene ii  the duke of lancaster palace 


enter john of gaunt with duchess


john of gaunt

alas  the part i had in woodstock blood
doth more solicit me than your exclaims 
to stir against the butchers of his life 
but since correction lieth in those hands
which made the fault that we cannot correct 
put we our quarrel to the will of heaven 
who  when they see the hours ripe on earth 
will rain hot vengeance on offenders  heads 


duchess

finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur 
hath love in thy old blood no living fire 
edward seven sons  whereof thyself art one 
were as seven vials of his sacred blood 
or seven fair branches springing from one root 
some of those seven are dried by nature course 
some of those branches by the destinies cut 
but thomas  my dear lord  my life  my gloucester 
one vial full of edward sacred blood 
one flourishing branch of his most royal root 
is crack d  and all the precious liquor spilt 
is hack down  and his summer leaves all faded 
by envy hand and murder bloody axe 
ah  gaunt  his blood was thine  that bed  that womb 
that metal  that self mould  that fashion thee
made him a man  and though thou livest and breathest 
yet art thou slain in him  thou dost consent
in some large measure to thy father death 
in that thou seest thy wretched brother die 
who was the model of thy father life 
call it not patience  gaunt  it is despair 
in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter d 
thou showest the naked pathway to thy life 
teaching stern murder how to butcher thee 
that which in mean men we intitle patience
is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts 
what shall i say  to safeguard thine own life 
the best way is to venge my gloucester death 


john of gaunt

god is the quarrel  for god substitute 
his deputy anointed in his sight 
hath caused his death  the which if wrongfully 
let heaven revenge  for i may never lift
an angry arm against his minister 


duchess

where then  alas  may i complain myself 


john of gaunt

to god  the widow champion and defence 


duchess

why  then  i will  farewell  old gaunt 
thou goest to coventry  there to behold
our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight 
o  sit my husband wrongs on hereford spear 
that it may enter butcher mowbray breast 
or  if misfortune miss the first career 
be mowbray sins so heavy in his bosom 
they may break his foaming courser back 
and throw the rider headlong in the lists 
a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford 
farewell  old gaunt  thy sometimes brother wife
with her companion grief must end her life 


john of gaunt

sister  farewell  i must to coventry 
as much good stay with thee as go with me 


duchess

yet one word more  grief boundeth where it falls 
not with the empty hollowness  but weight 
i take my leave before i have begun 
for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done 
commend me to thy brother  edmund york 
lo  this is all nay  yet depart not so 
though this be all  do not so quickly go 
i shall remember more  bid him ah  what 
with all good speed at plashy visit me 
alack  and what shall good old york there see
but empty lodgings and unfurnish walls 
unpeopled offices  untrodden stones 
and what hear there for welcome but my groans 
therefore commend me  let him not come there 
to seek out sorrow that dwells every where 
desolate  desolate  will i hence and die 
the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye 
exeunt
