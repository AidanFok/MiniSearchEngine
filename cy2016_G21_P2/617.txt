scene iv  the court 


enter king richard ii  with bagot and green at one door  and the duke of aumerle at another


king richard ii

we did observe  cousin aumerle 
how far brought you high hereford on his way 


duke of aumerle

i brought high hereford  if you call him so 
but to the next highway  and there i left him 


king richard ii

and say  what store of parting tears were shed 


duke of aumerle

faith  none for me  except the north east wind 
which then blew bitterly against our faces 
awaked the sleeping rheum  and so by chance
did grace our hollow parting with a tear 


king richard ii

what said our cousin when you parted with him 


duke of aumerle

 farewell 
and  for my heart disdained that my tongue
should so profane the word  that taught me craft
to counterfeit oppression of such grief
that words seem buried in my sorrow grave 
marry  would the word  farewell  have lengthen hours
and added years to his short banishment 
he should have had a volume of farewells 
but since it would not  he had none of me 


king richard ii

he is our cousin  cousin  but  doubt 
when time shall call him home from banishment 
whether our kinsman come to see his friends 
ourself and bushy  bagot here and green
observed his courtship to the common people 
how he did seem to dive into their hearts
with humble and familiar courtesy 
what reverence he did throw away on slaves 
wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
and patient underbearing of his fortune 
as  to banish their affects with him 
off goes his bonnet to an oyster wench 
a brace of draymen bid god speed him well
and had the tribute of his supple knee 
with  thanks  my countrymen  my loving friends 
as were our england in reversion his 
and he our subjects  next degree in hope 


green

well  he is gone  and with him go these thoughts 
now for the rebels which stand out in ireland 
expedient manage must be made  my liege 
ere further leisure yield them further means
for their advantage and your highness  loss 


king richard ii

we will ourself in person to this war 
and  for our coffers  with too great a court
and liberal largess  are grown somewhat light 
we are inforced to farm our royal realm 
the revenue whereof shall furnish us
for our affairs in hand  if that come short 
our substitutes at home shall have blank charters 
whereto  when they shall know what men are rich 
they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
and send them after to supply our wants 
for we will make for ireland presently 
enter bushy
bushy  what news 


bushy

old john of gaunt is grievous sick  my lord 
suddenly taken  and hath sent post haste
to entreat your majesty to visit him 


king richard ii

where lies he 


bushy

at ely house 


king richard ii

now put it  god  in the physician mind
to help him to his grave immediately 
the lining of his coffers shall make coats
to deck our soldiers for these irish wars 
come  gentlemen  let all go visit him 
pray god we may make haste  and come too late 


all

amen 
exeunt
