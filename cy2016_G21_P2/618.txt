scene i  ely house 


enter john of gaunt sick  with the duke of york    c


john of gaunt

will the king come  that i may breathe my last
in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth 


duke of york

vex not yourself  nor strive not with your breath 
for all in vain comes counsel to his ear 


john of gaunt

o  but they say the tongues of dying men
enforce attention like deep harmony 
where words are scarce  they are seldom spent in vain 
for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain 
he that no more must say is listen more
than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose 
more are men ends mark than their lives before 
the setting sun  and music at the close 
as the last taste of sweets  is sweetest last 
writ in remembrance more than things long past 
though richard my life counsel would not hear 
my death sad tale may yet undeaf his ear 


duke of york

no  it is stopp with other flattering sounds 
as praises  of whose taste the wise are fond 
lascivious metres  to whose venom sound
the open ear of youth doth always listen 
report of fashions in proud italy 
whose manners still our tardy apish nation
limps after in base imitation 
where doth the world thrust forth a vanity 
so it be new  there no respect how vile 
that is not quickly buzzed into his ears 
then all too late comes counsel to be heard 
where will doth mutiny with wit regard 
direct not him whose way himself will choose 
 breath thou lack st  and that breath wilt thou lose 


john of gaunt

methinks i am a prophet new inspired
and thus expiring do foretell of him 
his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last 
for violent fires soon burn out themselves 
small showers last long  but sudden storms are short 
he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes 
with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder 
light vanity  insatiate cormorant 
consuming means  soon preys upon itself 
this royal throne of kings  this scepter isle 
this earth of majesty  this seat of mars 
this other eden  demi paradise 
this fortress built by nature for herself
against infection and the hand of war 
this happy breed of men  this little world 
this precious stone set in the silver sea 
which serves it in the office of a wall 
or as a moat defensive to a house 
against the envy of less happier lands 
this blessed plot  this earth  this realm  this england 
this nurse  this teeming womb of royal kings 
fear by their breed and famous by their birth 
renowned for their deeds as far from home 
for christian service and true chivalry 
as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry 
of the world ransom  blessed mary son 
this land of such dear souls  this dear dear land 
dear for her reputation through the world 
is now leased out  i die pronouncing it 
like to a tenement or pelting farm 
england  bound in with the triumphant sea
whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
of watery neptune  is now bound in with shame 
with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds 
that england  that was wont to conquer others 
hath made a shameful conquest of itself 
ah  would the scandal vanish with my life 
how happy then were my ensuing death 
enter king richard ii and queen  duke of aumerle   bushy  green  bagot  lord ross  and lord willoughby


duke of york

the king is come  deal mildly with his youth 
for young hot colts being raged do rage the more 


queen

how fares our noble uncle  lancaster 


king richard ii

what comfort  man  how is with aged gaunt 


john of gaunt

o how that name befits my composition 
old gaunt indeed  and gaunt in being old 
within me grief hath kept a tedious fast 
and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt 
for sleeping england long time have i watch d 
watching breeds leanness  leanness is all gaunt 
the pleasure that some fathers feed upon 
is my strict fast  i mean  my children looks 
and therein fasting  hast thou made me gaunt 
gaunt am i for the grave  gaunt as a grave 
whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones 


king richard ii

can sick men play so nicely with their names 


john of gaunt

no  misery makes sport to mock itself 
since thou dost seek to kill my name in me 
i mock my name  great king  to flatter thee 


king richard ii

should dying men flatter with those that live 


john of gaunt

no  no  men living flatter those that die 


king richard ii

thou  now a dying  say thou flatterest me 


john of gaunt

o  no  thou diest  though i the sicker be 


king richard ii

i am in health  i breathe  and see thee ill 


john of gaunt

now he that made me knows i see thee ill 
ill in myself to see  and in thee seeing ill 
thy death bed is no lesser than thy land
wherein thou liest in reputation sick 
and thou  too careless patient as thou art 
commit thy anointed body to the cure
of those physicians that first wounded thee 
a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown 
whose compass is no bigger than thy head 
and yet  incaged in so small a verge 
the waste is no whit lesser than thy land 
o  had thy grandsire with a prophet eye
seen how his son son should destroy his sons 
from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame 
deposing thee before thou wert possess d 
which art possess now to depose thyself 
why  cousin  wert thou regent of the world 
it were a shame to let this land by lease 
but for thy world enjoying but this land 
is it not more than shame to shame it so 
landlord of england art thou now  not king 
thy state of law is bondslave to the law  and thou 


king richard ii

         a lunatic lean witted fool 
presuming on an ague privilege 
darest with thy frozen admonition
make pale our cheek  chasing the royal blood
with fury from his native residence 
now  by my seat right royal majesty 
wert thou not brother to great edward son 
this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders 


john of gaunt

o  spare me not  my brother edward son 
for that i was his father edward son 
that blood already  like the pelican 
hast thou tapp out and drunkenly caroused 
my brother gloucester  plain well meaning soul 
whom fair befal in heaven  happy souls 
may be a precedent and witness good
that thou respect not spilling edward blood 
join with the present sickness that i have 
and thy unkindness be like crooked age 
to crop at once a too long wither flower 
live in thy shame  but die not shame with thee 
these words hereafter thy tormentors be 
convey me to my bed  then to my grave 
love they to live that love and honour have 
exit  borne off by his attendants


king richard ii

and let them die that age and sullens have 
for both hast thou  and both become the grave 


duke of york

i do beseech your majesty  impute his words
to wayward sickliness and age in him 
he loves you  on my life  and holds you dear
as harry duke of hereford  were he here 


king richard ii

right  you say true  as hereford love  so his 
as theirs  so mine  and all be as it is 
enter northumberland


northumberland

my liege  old gaunt commends him to your majesty 


king richard ii

what says he 


northumberland

                  nay  nothing  all is said
his tongue is now a stringless instrument 
words  life and all  old lancaster hath spent 


duke of york

be york the next that must be bankrupt so 
though death be poor  it ends a mortal woe 


king richard ii

the ripest fruit first falls  and so doth he 
his time is spent  our pilgrimage must be 
so much for that  now for our irish wars 
we must supplant those rough rug headed kerns 
which live like venom where no venom else
but only they have privilege to live 
and for these great affairs do ask some charge 
towards our assistance we do seize to us
the plate  corn  revenues and moveables 
whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess d 


duke of york

how long shall i be patient  ah  how long
shall tender duty make me suffer wrong 
not gloucester death  nor hereford banishment
not gaunt rebukes  nor england private wrongs 
nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke
about his marriage  nor my own disgrace 
have ever made me sour my patient cheek 
or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign face 
i am the last of noble edward sons 
of whom thy father  prince of wales  was first 
in war was never lion raged more fierce 
in peace was never gentle lamb more mild 
than was that young and princely gentleman 
his face thou hast  for even so look he 
accomplish with the number of thy hours 
but when he frown d  it was against the french
and not against his friends  his noble hand
did will what he did spend and spent not that
which his triumphant father hand had won 
his hands were guilty of no kindred blood 
but bloody with the enemies of his kin 
o richard  york is too far gone with grief 
or else he never would compare between 


king richard ii

why  uncle  what the matter 


duke of york

o my liege 
pardon me  if you please  if n ot  i  pleased
not to be pardon d  am content withal 
seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
the royalties and rights of banish hereford 
is not gaunt dead  and doth not hereford live 
was not gaunt just  and is not harry true 
did not the one deserve to have an heir 
is not his heir a well deserving son 
take hereford rights away  and take from time
his charters and his customary rights 
let not to morrow then ensue to day 
be not thyself  for how art thou a king
but by fair sequence and succession 
now  afore god god forbid i say true 
if you do wrongfully seize hereford rights 
call in the letters patent that he hath
by his attorneys general to sue
his livery  and deny his offer homage 
you pluck a thousand dangers on your head 
you lose a thousand well disposed hearts
and prick my tender patience  to those thoughts
which honour and allegiance cannot think 


king richard ii

think what you will  we seize into our hands
his plate  his goods  his money and his lands 


duke of york

i not be by the while  my liege  farewell 
what will ensue hereof  there none can tell 
but by bad courses may be understood
that their events can never fall out good 
exit


king richard ii

go  bushy  to the earl of wiltshire straight 
bid him repair to us to ely house
to see this business  to morrow next
we will for ireland  and  time  i trow 
and we create  in absence of ourself 
our uncle york lord governor of england 
for he is just and always loved us well 
come on  our queen  to morrow must we part 
be merry  for our time of stay is short
flourish  exeunt king richard ii  queen  duke of aumerle  bushy  green  and bagot


northumberland

well  lords  the duke of lancaster is dead 


lord ross

and living too  for now his son is duke 


lord willoughby

barely in title  not in revenue 


northumberland

richly in both  if justice had her right 


lord ross

my heart is great  but it must break with silence 
ere be disburden with a liberal tongue 


northumberland

nay  speak thy mind  and let him ne speak more
that speaks thy words again to do thee harm 


lord willoughby

tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford 
if it be so  out with it boldly  man 
quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him 


lord ross

no good at all that i can do for him 
unless you call it good to pity him 
bereft and gelded of his patrimony 


northumberland

now  afore god   shame such wrongs are borne
in him  a royal prince  and many moe
of noble blood in this declining land 
the king is not himself  but basely led
by flatterers  and what they will inform 
merely in hate   any of us all 
that will the king severely prosecute
 us  our lives  our children  and our heirs 


lord ross

the commons hath he pill with grievous taxes 
and quite lost their hearts  the nobles hath he fined
for ancient quarrels  and quite lost their hearts 


lord willoughby

and daily new exactions are devised 
as blanks  benevolences  and i wot not what 
but what  o  god name  doth become of this 


northumberland

wars have not wasted it  for warr he hath not 
but basely yielded upon compromise
that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows 
more hath he spent in peace than they in wars 


lord ross

the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm 


lord willoughby

the king grown bankrupt  like a broken man 


northumberland

reproach and dissolution hangeth over him 


lord ross

he hath not money for these irish wars 
his burthenous taxations notwithstanding 
but by the robbing of the banish duke 


northumberland

his noble kinsman  most degenerate king 
but  lords  we hear this fearful tempest sing 
yet see no shelter to avoid the storm 
we see the wind sit sore upon our sails 
and yet we strike not  but securely perish 


lord ross

we see the very wreck that we must suffer 
and unavoided is the danger now 
for suffering so the causes of our wreck 


northumberland

not so  even through the hollow eyes of death
i spy life peering  but i dare not say
how near the tidings of our comfort is 


lord willoughby

nay  let us share thy thoughts  as thou dost ours 


lord ross

be confident to speak  northumberland 
we three are but thyself  and  speaking so 
thy words are but as thoughts  therefore  be bold 


northumberland

then thus  i have from port le blanc  a bay
in brittany  received intelligence
that harry duke of hereford  rainold lord cobham 
that late broke from the duke of exeter 
his brother  archbishop late of canterbury 
sir thomas erpingham  sir john ramston 
sir john norbery  sir robert waterton and francis quoint 
all these well furnish by the duke of bretagne
with eight tall ships  three thousand men of war 
are making hither with all due expedience
and shortly mean to touch our northern shore 
perhaps they had ere this  but that they stay
the first departing of the king for ireland 
if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke 
imp out our drooping country broken wing 
redeem from broking pawn the blemish crown 
wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre gilt
and make high majesty look like itself 
away with me in post to ravenspurgh 
but if you faint  as fearing to do so 
stay and be secret  and myself will go 


lord ross

to horse  to horse  urge doubts to them that fear 


lord willoughby

hold out my horse  and i will first be there 
exeunt
