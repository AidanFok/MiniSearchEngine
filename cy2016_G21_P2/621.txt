scene iv  a camp in wales 


enter earl of salisbury and a welsh captain


captain

my lord of salisbury  we have stay ten days 
and hardly kept our countrymen together 
and yet we hear no tidings from the king 
therefore we will disperse ourselves  farewell 


earl of salisbury

stay yet another day  thou trusty welshman 
the king reposeth all his confidence in thee 


captain

 thought the king is dead  we will not stay 
the bay trees in our country are all wither 
and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven 
the pale faced moon looks bloody on the earth
and lean look prophets whisper fearful change 
rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap 
the one in fear to lose what they enjoy 
the other to enjoy by rage and war 
these signs forerun the death or fall of kings 
farewell  our countrymen are gone and fled 
as well assured richard their king is dead 
exit


earl of salisbury

ah  richard  with the eyes of heavy mind
i see thy glory like a shooting star
fall to the base earth from the firmament 
thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west 
witnessing storms to come  woe and unrest 
thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes 
and crossly to thy good all fortune goes 
exit
