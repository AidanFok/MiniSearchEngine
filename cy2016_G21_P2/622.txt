scene i  bristol  before the castle 


enter henry bolingbroke  duke of york   northumberland  lord ross  henry percy  lord willoughby  with bushy and green  prisoners


henry bolingbroke

bring forth these men 
bushy and green  i will not vex your souls 
since presently your souls must part your bodies 
with too much urging your pernicious lives 
for  no charity  yet  to wash your blood
from off my hands  here in the view of men
i will unfold some causes of your deaths 
you have misled a prince  a royal king 
a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments 
by you unhappied and disfigured clean 
you have in manner with your sinful hours
made a divorce betwixt his queen and him 
broke the possession of a royal bed
and stain the beauty of a fair queen cheeks
with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs 
myself  a prince by fortune of my birth 
near to the king in blood  and near in love
till you did make him misinterpret me 
have stoop my neck under your injuries 
and sigh my english breath in foreign clouds 
eating the bitter bread of banishment 
whilst you have fed upon my signories 
dispark my parks and fell my forest woods 
from my own windows torn my household coat 
razed out my imprese  leaving me no sign 
save men opinions and my living blood 
to show the world i am a gentleman 
this and much more  much more than twice all this 
condemns you to the death  see them deliver over
to execution and the hand of death 


bushy

more welcome is the stroke of death to me
than bolingbroke to england  lords  farewell 


green

my comfort is that heaven will take our souls
and plague injustice with the pains of hell 


henry bolingbroke

my lord northumberland  see them dispatch d 
exeunt northumberland and others  with the prisoners
uncle  you say the queen is at your house 
for god sake  fairly let her be entreated 
tell her i send to her my kind commends 
take special care my greetings be deliver d 


duke of york

a gentleman of mine i have dispatch 
with letters of your love to her at large 


henry bolingbroke

thank  gentle uncle  come  lords  away 
to fight with glendower and his complices 
awhile to work  and after holiday 
exeunt
