scene ii  the coast of wales  a castle in view 


drums  flourish and colours  enter king richard ii  the bishop of carlisle  duke of aumerle  and soldiers


king richard ii

barkloughly castle call they this at hand 


duke of aumerle

yea  my lord  how brooks your grace the air 
after your late tossing on the breaking seas 


king richard ii

needs must i like it well  i weep for joy
to stand upon my kingdom once again 
dear earth  i do salute thee with my hand 
though rebels wound thee with their horses  hoofs 
as a long parted mother with her child
plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting 
so  weeping  smiling  greet i thee  my earth 
and do thee favours with my royal hands 
feed not thy sovereign foe  my gentle earth 
nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense 
but let thy spiders  that suck up thy venom 
and heavy gaited toads lie in their way 
doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
which with usurping steps do trample thee 
yield stinging nettles to mine enemies 
and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower 
guard it  i pray thee  with a lurking adder
whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
throw death upon thy sovereign enemies 
mock not my senseless conjuration  lords 
this earth shall have a feeling and these stones
prove armed soldiers  ere her native king
shall falter under foul rebellion arms 


bishop of carlisle

fear not  my lord  that power that made you king
hath power to keep you king in spite of all 
the means that heaven yields must be embraced 
and not neglected  else  if heaven would 
and we will not  heaven offer we refuse 
the proffer means of succor and redress 


duke of aumerle

he means  my lord  that we are too remiss 
whilst bolingbroke  through our security 
grows strong and great in substance and in power 


king richard ii

discomfortable cousin  know thou not
that when the searching eye of heaven is hid 
behind the globe  that lights the lower world 
then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
in murders and in outrage  boldly here 
but when from under this terrestrial ball
he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
and darts his light through every guilty hole 
then murders  treasons and detested sins 
the cloak of night being pluck from off their backs 
stand bare and naked  trembling at themselves 
so when this thief  this traitor  bolingbroke 
who all this while hath revell in the night
whilst we were wandering with the antipodes 
shall see us rising in our throne  the east 
his treasons will sit blushing in his face 
not able to endure the sight of day 
but self affrighted tremble at his sin 
not all the water in the rough rude sea
can wash the balm off from an anointed king 
the breath of worldly men cannot depose
the deputy elected by the lord 
for every man that bolingbroke hath press 
to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown 
god for his richard hath in heavenly pay
a glorious angel  then  if angels fight 
weak men must fall  for heaven still guards the right 
enter earl of salisbury
welcome  my lord	how far off lies your power 


earl of salisbury

nor near nor farther off  my gracious lord 
than this weak arm  discomfort guides my tongue
and bids me speak of nothing but despair 
one day too late  i fear me  noble lord 
hath clouded all thy happy days on earth 
o  call back yesterday  bid time return 
and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men 
to day  to day  unhappy day  too late 
o thy joys  friends  fortune and thy state 
for all the welshmen  hearing thou wert dead 
are gone to bolingbroke  dispersed and fled 


duke of aumerle

comfort  my liege  why looks your grace so pale 


king richard ii

but now the blood of twenty thousand men
did triumph in my face  and they are fled 
and  till so much blood thither come again 
have i not reason to look pale and dead 
all souls that will be safe fly from my side 
for time hath set a blot upon my pride 


duke of aumerle

comfort  my liege  remember who you are 


king richard ii

i had forgot myself  am i not king 
awake  thou coward majesty  thou sleepest 
is not the king name twenty thousand names 
arm  arm  my name  a puny subject strikes
at thy great glory  look not to the ground 
ye favourites of a king  are we not high 
high be our thoughts  i know my uncle york
hath power enough to serve our turn  but who comes here 
enter sir stephen scroop


sir stephen scroop

more health and happiness betide my liege
than can my care tuned tongue deliver him 


king richard ii

mine ear is open and my heart prepared 
the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold 
say  is my kingdom lost  why   my care
and what loss is it to be rid of care 
strives bolingbroke to be as great as we 
greater he shall not be  if he serve god 
we serve him too and be his fellow so 
revolt our subjects  that we cannot mend 
they break their faith to god as well as us 
cry woe  destruction  ruin and decay 
the worst is death  and death will have his day 


sir stephen scroop

glad am i that your highness is so arm 
to bear the tidings of calamity 
like an unseasonable stormy day 
which makes the silver rivers drown their shores 
as if the world were all dissolved to tears 
so high above his limits swells the rage
of bolingbroke  covering your fearful land
with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel 
white beards have arm their thin and hairless scalps
against thy majesty  boys  with women voices 
strive to speak big and clap their female joints
in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown 
the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
of double fatal yew against thy state 
yea  distaff women manage rusty bills
against thy seat  both young and old rebel 
and all goes worse than i have power to tell 


king richard ii

too well  too well thou tell a tale so ill 
where is the earl of wiltshire  where is bagot 
what is become of bushy  where is green 
that they have let the dangerous enemy
measure our confines with such peaceful steps 
if we prevail  their heads shall pay for it 
i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke 


sir stephen scroop

peace have they made with him indeed  my lord 


king richard ii

o villains  vipers  damn without redemption 
dogs  easily won to fawn on any man 
snakes  in my heart blood warm d  that sting my heart 
three judases  each one thrice worse than judas 
would they make peace  terrible hell make war
upon their spotted souls for this offence 


sir stephen scroop

sweet love  i see  changing his property 
turns to the sourest and most deadly hate 
again uncurse their souls  their peace is made
with heads  and not with hands  those whom you curse
have felt the worst of death destroying wound
and lie full low  graved in the hollow ground 


duke of aumerle

is bushy  green  and the earl of wiltshire dead 


sir stephen scroop

ay  all of them at bristol lost their heads 


duke of aumerle

where is the duke my father with his power 


king richard ii

no matter where  of comfort no man speak 
let talk of graves  of worms  and epitaphs 
make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
write sorrow on the bosom of the earth 
let choose executors and talk of wills 
and yet not so  for what can we bequeath
save our deposed bodies to the ground 
our lands  our lives and all are bolingbroke s 
and nothing can we call our own but death
and that small model of the barren earth
which serves as paste and cover to our bones 
for god sake  let us sit upon the ground
and tell sad stories of the death of kings 
how some have been deposed  some slain in war 
some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed 
some poison by their wives  some sleeping kill d 
all murder d  for within the hollow crown
that rounds the mortal temples of a king
keeps death his court and there the antic sits 
scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp 
allowing him a breath  a little scene 
to monarchize  be fear and kill with looks 
infusing him with self and vain conceit 
as if this flesh which walls about our life 
were brass impregnable  and humour thus
comes at the last and with a little pin
bores through his castle wall  and farewell king 
cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
with solemn reverence  throw away respect 
tradition  form and ceremonious duty 
for you have but mistook me all this while 
i live with bread like you  feel want 
taste grief  need friends  subjected thus 
how can you say to me  i am a king 


bishop of carlisle

my lord  wise men ne sit and wail their woes 
but presently prevent the ways to wail 
to fear the foe  since fear oppresseth strength 
gives in your weakness strength unto your foe 
and so your follies fight against yourself 
fear and be slain  no worse can come to fight 
and fight and die is death destroying death 
where fearing dying pays death servile breath 


duke of aumerle

my father hath a power  inquire of him
and learn to make a body of a limb 


king richard ii

thou chidest me well  proud bolingbroke  i come
to change blows with thee for our day of doom 
this ague fit of fear is over blown 
an easy task it is to win our own 
say  scroop  where lies our uncle with his power 
speak sweetly  man  although thy looks be sour 


sir stephen scroop

men judge by the complexion of the sky
the state and inclination of the day 
so may you by my dull and heavy eye 
my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say 
i play the torturer  by small and small
to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken 
your uncle york is join with bolingbroke 
and all your northern castles yielded up 
and all your southern gentlemen in arms
upon his party 


king richard ii

                  thou hast said enough 
beshrew thee  cousin  which didst lead me forth
to duke of aumerle
of that sweet way i was in to despair 
what say you now  what comfort have we now 
by heaven  i hate him everlastingly
that bids me be of comfort any more 
go to flint castle  there i pine away 
a king  woe slave  shall kingly woe obey 
that power i have  discharge  and let them go
to ear the land that hath some hope to grow 
for i have none  let no man speak again
to alter this  for counsel is but vain 


duke of aumerle

my liege  one word 


king richard ii

he does me double wrong
that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue 
discharge my followers  let them hence away 
from richard night to bolingbroke fair day 
exeunt
