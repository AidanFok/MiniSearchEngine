scene iii  wales  before flint castle 


enter  with drum and colours  henry bolingbroke  duke of york  northumberland  attendants  and forces


henry bolingbroke

so that by this intelligence we learn
the welshmen are dispersed  and salisbury
is gone to meet the king  who lately landed
with some few private friends upon this coast 


northumberland

the news is very fair and good  my lord 
richard not far from hence hath hid his head 


duke of york

it would beseem the lord northumberland
to say  richard  alack the heavy day
when such a sacred king should hide his head 


northumberland

your grace mistakes  only to be brief
left i his title out 


duke of york

the time hath been 
would you have been so brief with him  he would
have been so brief with you  to shorten you 
for taking so the head  your whole head length 


henry bolingbroke

mistake not  uncle  further than you should 


duke of york

take not  good cousin  further than you should 
lest you mistake the heavens are o our heads 


henry bolingbroke

i know it  uncle  and oppose not myself
against their will  but who comes here 
enter henry percy
welcome  harry  what  will not this castle yield 


henry percy

the castle royally is mann d  my lord 
against thy entrance 


henry bolingbroke

royally 
why  it contains no king 


henry percy

yes  my good lord 
it doth contain a king  king richard lies
within the limits of yon lime and stone 
and with him are the lord aumerle  lord salisbury 
sir stephen scroop  besides a clergyman
of holy reverence  who  i cannot learn 


northumberland

o  belike it is the bishop of carlisle 


henry bolingbroke

noble lords 
go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle 
through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
into his ruin ears  and thus deliver 
henry bolingbroke
on both his knees doth kiss king richard hand
and sends allegiance and true faith of heart
to his most royal person  hither come
even at his feet to lay my arms and power 
provided that my banishment repeal 
and lands restored again be freely granted 
if not  i use the advantage of my power
and lay the summer dust with showers of blood
rain from the wounds of slaughter englishmen 
the which  how far off from the mind of bolingbroke
it is  such crimson tempest should bedrench
the fresh green lap of fair king richard land 
my stooping duty tenderly shall show 
go  signify as much  while here we march
upon the grassy carpet of this plain 
let march without the noise of threatening drum 
that from this castle tatter battlements
our fair appointments may be well perused 
methinks king richard and myself should meet
with no less terror than the elements
of fire and water  when their thundering shock
at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven 
be he the fire  i be the yielding water 
the rage be his  whilst on the earth i rain
my waters  on the earth  and not on him 
march on  and mark king richard how he looks 
parle without  and answer within  then a flourish   enter on the walls  king richard ii  the bishop of  carlisle  duke of aumerle  sir stephen scroop  and earl of salisbury
see  see  king richard doth himself appear 
as doth the blushing discontented sun
from out the fiery portal of the east 
when he perceives the envious clouds are bent
to dim his glory and to stain the track
of his bright passage to the occident 


duke of york

yet looks he like a king  behold  his eye 
as bright as is the eagle s  lightens forth
controlling majesty  alack  alack  for woe 
that any harm should stain so fair a show 


king richard ii

we are amazed  and thus long have we stood
to watch the fearful bending of thy knee 
to northumberland
because we thought ourself thy lawful king 
and if we be  how dare thy joints forget
to pay their awful duty to our presence 
if we be not  show us the hand of god
that hath dismissed us from our stewardship 
for well we know  no hand of blood and bone
can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre 
unless he do profane  steal  or usurp 
and though you think that all  as you have done 
have torn their souls by turning them from us 
and we are barren and bereft of friends 
yet know  my master  god omnipotent 
is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
armies of pestilence  and they shall strike
your children yet unborn and unbegot 
that lift your vassal hands against my head
and threat the glory of my precious crown 
tell bolingbroke for yond methinks he stands 
that every stride he makes upon my land
is dangerous treason  he is come to open
the purple testament of bleeding war 
but ere the crown he looks for live in peace 
ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers  sons
shall ill become the flower of england face 
change the complexion of her maid pale peace
to scarlet indignation and bedew
her pastures  grass with faithful english blood 


northumberland

the king of heaven forbid our lord the king
should so with civil and uncivil arms
be rush upon  thy thrice noble cousin
harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand 
and by the honourable tomb he swears 
that stands upon your royal grandsire bones 
and by the royalties of both your bloods 
currents that spring from one most gracious head 
and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt 
and by the worth and honour of himself 
comprising all that may be sworn or said 
his coming hither hath no further scope
than for his lineal royalties and to beg
enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees 
which on thy royal party granted once 
his glittering arms he will commend to rust 
his barbed steeds to stables  and his heart
to faithful service of your majesty 
this swears he  as he is a prince  is just 
and  as i am a gentleman  i credit him 


king richard ii

northumberland  say thus the king returns 
his noble cousin is right welcome hither 
and all the number of his fair demands
shall be accomplish without contradiction 
with all the gracious utterance thou hast
speak to his gentle hearing kind commends 
we do debase ourselves  cousin  do we not 
to duke of aumerle
to look so poorly and to speak so fair 
shall we call back northumberland  and send
defiance to the traitor  and so die 


duke of aumerle

no  good my lord  let fight with gentle words
till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords 


king richard ii

o god  o god  that e this tongue of mine 
that laid the sentence of dread banishment
on yon proud man  should take it off again
with words of sooth  o that i were as great
as is my grief  or lesser than my name 
or that i could forget what i have been 
or not remember what i must be now 
swell thou  proud heart  i give thee scope to beat 
since foes have scope to beat both thee and me 


duke of aumerle

northumberland comes back from bolingbroke 


king richard ii

what must the king do now  must he submit 
the king shall do it  must he be deposed 
the king shall be contented  must he lose
the name of king  o  god name  let it go 
i give my jewels for a set of beads 
my gorgeous palace for a hermitage 
my gay apparel for an almsman gown 
my figured goblets for a dish of wood 
my sceptre for a palmer walking staff 
my subjects for a pair of carved saints
and my large kingdom for a little grave 
a little little grave  an obscure grave 
or i be buried in the king highway 
some way of common trade  where subjects  feet
may hourly trample on their sovereign head 
for on my heart they tread now whilst i live 
and buried once  why not upon my head 
aumerle  thou weep st  my tender hearted cousin 
we make foul weather with despised tears 
our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn 
and make a dearth in this revolting land 
or shall we play the wantons with our woes 
and make some pretty match with shedding tears 
as thus  to drop them still upon one place 
till they have fretted us a pair of graves
within the earth  and  therein laid there lies
two kinsmen digg their graves with weeping eyes 
would not this ill do well  well  well  i see
i talk but idly  and you laugh at me 
most mighty prince  my lord northumberland 
what says king bolingbroke  will his majesty
give richard leave to live till richard die 
you make a leg  and bolingbroke says ay 


northumberland

my lord  in the base court he doth attend
to speak with you  may it please you to come down 


king richard ii

down  down i come  like glistering phaethon 
wanting the manage of unruly jades 
in the base court  base court  where kings grow base 
to come at traitors  calls and do them grace 
in the base court  come down  down  court 
down  king 
for night owls shriek where mounting larks
should sing 
exeunt from above


henry bolingbroke

what says his majesty 


northumberland

sorrow and grief of heart
makes him speak fondly  like a frantic man
yet he is come 
enter king richard and his attendants below


henry bolingbroke

stand all apart 
and show fair duty to his majesty 
he kneels down
my gracious lord 


king richard ii

fair cousin  you debase your princely knee
to make the base earth proud with kissing it 
me rather had my heart might feel your love
than my unpleased eye see your courtesy 
up  cousin  up  your heart is up  i know 
thus high at least  although your knee be low 


henry bolingbroke

my gracious lord  i come but for mine own 


king richard ii

your own is yours  and i am yours  and all 


henry bolingbroke

so far be mine  my most redoubted lord 
as my true service shall deserve your love 


king richard ii

well you deserve  they well deserve to have 
that know the strong and surest way to get 
uncle  give me your hands  nay  dry your eyes 
tears show their love  but want their remedies 
cousin  i am too young to be your father 
though you are old enough to be my heir 
what you will have  i give  and willing too 
for do we must what force will have us do 
set on towards london  cousin  is it so 


henry bolingbroke

yea  my good lord 


king richard ii

then i must not say no 
flourish  exeunt
