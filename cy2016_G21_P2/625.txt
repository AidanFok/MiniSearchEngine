scene iv  langley  the duke of york garden 


enter the queen and two ladies


queen

what sport shall we devise here in this garden 
to drive away the heavy thought of care 


lady

madam  we play at bowls 


queen

 make me think the world is full of rubs 
and that my fortune rubs against the bias 


lady

madam  we dance 


queen

my legs can keep no measure in delight 
when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief 
therefore  no dancing  girl  some other sport 


lady

madam  we tell tales 


queen

of sorrow or of joy 


lady

of either  madam 


queen

of neither  girl 
for of joy  being altogether wanting 
it doth remember me the more of sorrow 
or if of grief  being altogether had 
it adds more sorrow to my want of joy 
for what i have i need not to repeat 
and what i want it boots not to complain 


lady

madam  i sing 


queen

 well that thou hast cause
but thou shouldst please me better  wouldst thou weep 


lady

i could weep  madam  would it do you good 


queen

and i could sing  would weeping do me good 
and never borrow any tear of thee 
enter a gardener  and two servants
but stay  here come the gardeners 
let step into the shadow of these trees 
my wretchedness unto a row of pins 
they talk of state  for every one doth so
against a change  woe is forerun with woe 
queen and ladies retire


gardener

go  bind thou up yon dangling apricocks 
which  like unruly children  make their sire
stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight 
give some supportance to the bending twigs 
go thou  and like an executioner 
cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays 
that look too lofty in our commonwealth 
all must be even in our government 
you thus employ d  i will go root away
the noisome weeds  which without profit suck
the soil fertility from wholesome flowers 


servant

why should we in the compass of a pale
keep law and form and due proportion 
showing  as in a model  our firm estate 
when our sea walled garden  the whole land 
is full of weeds  her fairest flowers choked up 
her fruit trees all upturned  her hedges ruin d 
her knots disorder and her wholesome herbs
swarming with caterpillars 


gardener

hold thy peace 
he that hath suffer this disorder spring
hath now himself met with the fall of leaf 
the weeds which his broad spreading leaves did shelter 
that seem in eating him to hold him up 
are pluck up root and all by bolingbroke 
i mean the earl of wiltshire  bushy  green 


servant

what  are they dead 


gardener

they are  and bolingbroke
hath seized the wasteful king  o  what pity is it
that he had not so trimm and dress his land
as we this garden  we at time of year
do wound the bark  the skin of our fruit trees 
lest  being over proud in sap and blood 
with too much riches it confound itself 
had he done so to great and growing men 
they might have lived to bear and he to taste
their fruits of duty  superfluous branches
we lop away  that bearing boughs may live 
had he done so  himself had borne the crown 
which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down 


servant

what  think you then the king shall be deposed 


gardener

depress he is already  and deposed
 doubt he will be  letters came last night
to a dear friend of the good duke of york s 
that tell black tidings 


queen

o  i am press to death through want of speaking 
coming forward
thou  old adam likeness  set to dress this garden 
how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news 
what eve  what serpent  hath suggested thee
to make a second fall of cursed man 
why dost thou say king richard is deposed 
darest thou  thou little better thing than earth 
divine his downfall  say  where  when  and how 
camest thou by this ill tidings  speak  thou wretch 


gardener

pardon me  madam  little joy have i
to breathe this news  yet what i say is true 
king richard  he is in the mighty hold
of bolingbroke  their fortunes both are weigh d 
in your lord scale is nothing but himself 
and some few vanities that make him light 
but in the balance of great bolingbroke 
besides himself  are all the english peers 
and with that odds he weighs king richard down 
post you to london  and you will find it so 
i speak no more than every one doth know 


queen

nimble mischance  that art so light of foot 
doth not thy embassage belong to me 
and am i last that knows it  o  thou think 
to serve me last  that i may longest keep
thy sorrow in my breast  come  ladies  go 
to meet at london london king in woe 
what  was i born to this  that my sad look
should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke 
gardener  for telling me these news of woe 
pray god the plants thou graft may never grow 
exeunt queen and ladies


gardener

poor queen  so that thy state might be no worse 
i would my skill were subject to thy curse 
here did she fall a tear  here in this place
i set a bank of rue  sour herb of grace 
rue  even for ruth  here shortly shall be seen 
in the remembrance of a weeping queen 
exeunt
