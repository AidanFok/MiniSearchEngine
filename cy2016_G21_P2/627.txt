scene i  london  a street leading to the tower 


enter queen and ladies


queen

this way the king will come  this is the way
to julius caesar ill erected tower 
to whose flint bosom my condemned lord
is doom a prisoner by proud bolingbroke 
here let us rest  if this rebellious earth
have any resting for her true king queen 
enter king richard ii and guard
but soft  but see  or rather do not see 
my fair rose wither  yet look up  behold 
that you in pity may dissolve to dew 
and wash him fresh again with true love tears 
ah  thou  the model where old troy did stand 
thou map of honour  thou king richard tomb 
and not king richard  thou most beauteous inn 
why should hard favour grief be lodged in thee 
when triumph is become an alehouse guest 


king richard ii

join not with grief  fair woman  do not so 
to make my end too sudden  learn  good soul 
to think our former state a happy dream 
from which awaked  the truth of what we are
shows us but this  i am sworn brother  sweet 
to grim necessity  and he and i
will keep a league till death  hie thee to france
and cloister thee in some religious house 
our holy lives must win a new world crown 
which our profane hours here have stricken down 


queen

what  is my richard both in shape and mind
transform and weaken d  hath bolingbroke deposed
thine intellect  hath he been in thy heart 
the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw 
and wounds the earth  if nothing else  with rage
to be o erpower d  and wilt thou  pupil like 
take thy correction mildly  kiss the rod 
and fawn on rage with base humility 
which art a lion and a king of beasts 


king richard ii

a king of beasts  indeed  if aught but beasts 
i had been still a happy king of men 
good sometime queen  prepare thee hence for france 
think i am dead and that even here thou takest 
as from my death bed  thy last living leave 
in winter tedious nights sit by the fire
with good old folks and let them tell thee tales
of woeful ages long ago betid 
and ere thou bid good night  to quit their griefs 
tell thou the lamentable tale of me
and send the hearers weeping to their beds 
for why  the senseless brands will sympathize
the heavy accent of thy moving tongue
and in compassion weep the fire out 
and some will mourn in ashes  some coal black 
for the deposing of a rightful king 
enter northumberland and others


northumberland

my lord  the mind of bolingbroke is changed 
you must to pomfret  not unto the tower 
and  madam  there is order ta for you 
with all swift speed you must away to france 


king richard ii

northumberland  thou ladder wherewithal
the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne 
the time shall not be many hours of age
more than it is ere foul sin gathering head
shalt break into corruption  thou shalt think 
though he divide the realm and give thee half 
it is too little  helping him to all 
and he shall think that thou  which know the way
to plant unrightful kings  wilt know again 
being ne so little urged  another way
to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne 
the love of wicked men converts to fear 
that fear to hate  and hate turns one or both
to worthy danger and deserved death 


northumberland

my guilt be on my head  and there an end 
take leave and part  for you must part forthwith 


king richard ii

doubly divorced  bad men  you violate
a twofold marriage   my crown and me 
and then betwixt me and my married wife 
let me unkiss the oath  thee and me 
and yet not so  for with a kiss  made 
part us  northumberland  i toward the north 
where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime 
my wife to france  from whence  set forth in pomp 
she came adorned hither like sweet may 
sent back like hallowmas or short of day 


queen

and must we be divided  must we part 


king richard ii

ay  hand from hand  my love  and heart from heart 


queen

banish us both and send the king with me 


northumberland

that were some love but little policy 


queen

then whither he goes  thither let me go 


king richard ii

so two  together weeping  make one woe 
weep thou for me in france  i for thee here 
better far off than near  be ne the near 
go  count thy way with sighs  i mine with groans 


queen

so longest way shall have the longest moans 


king richard ii

twice for one step i groan  the way being short 
and piece the way out with a heavy heart 
come  come  in wooing sorrow let be brief 
since  wedding it  there is such length in grief 
one kiss shall stop our mouths  and dumbly part 
thus give i mine  and thus take i thy heart 


queen

give me mine own again   no good part
to take on me to keep and kill thy heart 
so  now i have mine own again  be gone 
that i might strive to kill it with a groan 


king richard ii

we make woe wanton with this fond delay 
once more  adieu  the rest let sorrow say 
exeunt
