scene ii  the duke of york palace 


enter duke of york and duchess of york


duchess of york

my lord  you told me you would tell the rest 
when weeping made you break the story off 
of our two cousins coming into london 


duke of york

where did i leave 


duchess of york

                  at that sad stop  my lord 
where rude misgovern hands from windows  tops
threw dust and rubbish on king richard head 


duke of york

then  as i said  the duke  great bolingbroke 
mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
which his aspiring rider seem to know 
with slow but stately pace kept on his course 
whilst all tongues cried  save thee 
bolingbroke 
you would have thought the very windows spake 
so many greedy looks of young and old
through casements darted their desiring eyes
upon his visage  and that all the walls
with painted imagery had said at once
 preserve thee  welcome  bolingbroke 
whilst he  from the one side to the other turning 
bareheaded  lower than his proud steed neck 
bespake them thus   thank you  countrymen 
and thus still doing  thus he pass along 


duchess of york

alack  poor richard  where rode he the whilst 


duke of york

as in a theatre  the eyes of men 
after a well graced actor leaves the stage 
are idly bent on him that enters next 
thinking his prattle to be tedious 
even so  or with much more contempt  men eyes
did scowl on gentle richard  no man cried  save him 
no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home 
but dust was thrown upon his sacred head 
which with such gentle sorrow he shook off 
his face still combating with tears and smiles 
the badges of his grief and patience 
that had not god  for some strong purpose  steel 
the hearts of men  they must perforce have melted
and barbarism itself have pitied him 
but heaven hath a hand in these events 
to whose high will we bound our calm contents 
to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now 
whose state and honour i for aye allow 


duchess of york

here comes my son aumerle 


duke of york

and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age 
and rob me of a happy mother name 
is he not like thee  is he not thine own 


duke of york

thou fond mad woman

hadst thou groan for him
as i have done  thou wouldst be more pitiful 
but now i know thy mind  thou dost suspect
that i have been disloyal to thy bed 
and that he is a bastard  not thy son 
sweet york  sweet husband  be not of that mind 
he is as like thee as a man may be 
not like to me  or any of my kin 
and yet i love him 


duke of york

make way  unruly woman 
exit


duchess of york

after  aumerle  mount thee upon his horse 
spur post  and get before him to the king 
and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee 
i not be long behind  though i be old 
i doubt not but to ride as fast as york 
and never will i rise up from the ground
till bolingbroke have pardon thee  away  be gone 
exeunt
