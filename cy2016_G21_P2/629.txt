scene iii  a royal palace 


enter henry bolingbroke  henry percy  and other lords


henry bolingbroke

can no man tell me of my unthrifty son 
 full three months since i did see him last 
if any plague hang over us   he 
i would to god  my lords  he might be found 
inquire at london   the taverns there 
for there  they say  he daily doth frequent 
with unrestrained loose companions 
even such  they say  as stand in narrow lanes 
and beat our watch  and rob our passengers 
which he  young wanton and effeminate boy 
takes on the point of honour to support
so dissolute a crew 


henry percy

my lord  some two days since i saw the prince 
and told him of those triumphs held at oxford 


henry bolingbroke

and what said the gallant 


henry percy

his answer was  he would unto the stews 
and from the common creature pluck a glove 
and wear it as a favour  and with that
he would unhorse the lustiest challenger 


henry bolingbroke

as dissolute as desperate  yet through both
i see some sparks of better hope  which elder years
may happily bring forth  but who comes here 
enter duke of aumerle


duke of aumerle

where is the king 


henry bolingbroke

what means our cousin  that he stares and looks
so wildly 


duke of aumerle

god save your grace  i do beseech your majesty 
to have some conference with your grace alone 


henry bolingbroke

withdraw yourselves  and leave us here alone 
exeunt henry percy and lords
what is the matter with our cousin now 


duke of aumerle

for ever may my knees grow to the earth 
my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
unless a pardon ere i rise or speak 


henry bolingbroke

intended or committed was this fault 
if on the first  how heinous e it be 
to win thy after love i pardon thee 


duke of aumerle

then give me leave that i may turn the key 
that no man enter till my tale be done 


henry bolingbroke

have thy desire 


duke of york

 within   my liege  beware  look to thyself 
thou hast a traitor in thy presence there 


henry bolingbroke

drawing


duke of aumerle

stay thy revengeful hand  thou hast no cause to fear 


duke of york

 within   open the door  secure  foolhardy king 
shall i for love speak treason to thy face 
open the door  or i will break it open 
enter duke of york


henry bolingbroke

what is the matter  uncle  speak 
recover breath  tell us how near is danger 
that we may arm us to encounter it 


duke of york

peruse this writing here  and thou shalt know
the treason that my haste forbids me show 


duke of aumerle

remember  as thou read st  thy promise pass d 
i do repent me  read not my name there
my heart is not confederate with my hand 


duke of york

it was  villain  ere thy hand did set it down 
i tore it from the traitor bosom  king 
fear  and not love  begets his penitence 
forget to pity him  lest thy pity prove
a serpent that will sting thee to the heart 


henry bolingbroke

o heinous  strong and bold conspiracy 
o loyal father of a treacherous son 
thou sheer  immaculate and silver fountain 
from when this stream through muddy passages
hath held his current and defiled himself 
thy overflow of good converts to bad 
and thy abundant goodness shall excuse
this deadly blot in thy digressing son 


duke of york

so shall my virtue be his vice bawd 
and he shall spend mine honour with his shame 
as thriftless sons their scraping fathers  gold 
mine honour lives when his dishonour dies 
or my shamed life in his dishonour lies 
thou kill me in his life  giving him breath 
the traitor lives  the true man put to death 


duchess of york

 within   what ho  my liege  for god sake 
let me in 


henry bolingbroke

what shrill voiced suppliant makes this eager cry 


duchess of york

a woman  and thy aunt  great king   i 
speak with me  pity me  open the door 
a beggar begs that never begg before 


henry bolingbroke

our scene is alter from a serious thing 
and now changed to  beggar and the king 
my dangerous cousin  let your mother in 
i know she is come to pray for your foul sin 


duke of york

if thou do pardon  whosoever pray 
more sins for this forgiveness prosper may 
this fester joint cut off  the rest rest sound 
this let alone will all the rest confound 
enter duchess of york


duchess of york

o king  believe not this hard hearted man 
love loving not itself none other can 


duke of york

thou frantic woman  what dost thou make here 
shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear 


duchess of york

sweet york  be patient  hear me  gentle liege 
kneels


henry bolingbroke

rise up  good aunt 


duchess of york

not yet  i thee beseech 
for ever will i walk upon my knees 
and never see day that the happy sees 
till thou give joy  until thou bid me joy 
by pardoning rutland  my transgressing boy 


duke of aumerle

unto my mother prayers i bend my knee 


duke of york

against them both my true joints bended be 
ill mayst thou thrive  if thou grant any grace 


duchess of york

pleads he in earnest  look upon his face 
his eyes do drop no tears  his prayers are in jest 
his words come from his mouth  ours from our breast 
he prays but faintly and would be denied 
we pray with heart and soul and all beside 
his weary joints would gladly rise  i know 
our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow 
his prayers are full of false hypocrisy 
ours of true zeal and deep integrity 
our prayers do out pray his  then let them have
that mercy which true prayer ought to have 


henry bolingbroke

good aunt  stand up 


duchess of york

nay  do not say   up 
say   pardon  first  and afterwards  up 
and if i were thy nurse  thy tongue to teach 
 pardon  should be the first word of thy speech 
i never long to hear a word till now 
say  pardon  king  let pity teach thee how 
the word is short  but not so short as sweet 
no word like  pardon  for kings  mouths so meet 


duke of york

speak it in french  king  say   moi 


duchess of york

dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy 
ah  my sour husband  my hard hearted lord 
that set the word itself against the word 
speak  pardon  as  current in our land 
the chopping french we do not understand 
thine eye begins to speak  set thy tongue there 
or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear 
that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce 
pity may move thee  pardon  to rehearse 


henry bolingbroke

good aunt  stand up 


duchess of york

i do not sue to stand 
pardon is all the suit i have in hand 


henry bolingbroke

i pardon him  as god shall pardon me 


duchess of york

o happy vantage of a kneeling knee 
yet am i sick for fear  speak it again 
twice saying  pardon  doth not pardon twain 
but makes one pardon strong 


henry bolingbroke

with all my heart
i pardon him 


duchess of york

                  a god on earth thou art 


henry bolingbroke

but for our trusty brother in law and the abbot 
with all the rest of that consorted crew 
destruction straight shall dog them at the heels 
good uncle  help to order several powers
to oxford  or where these traitors are 
they shall not live within this world  i swear 
but i will have them  if i once know where 
uncle  farewell  and  cousin too  adieu 
your mother well hath pray d  and prove you true 


duchess of york

come  my old son  i pray god make thee new 
exeunt
