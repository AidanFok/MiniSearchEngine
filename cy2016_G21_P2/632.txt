the heads of oxford  salisbury  blunt  and kent

at large discoursed in this paper here

the heads of brocas and sir bennet seely 
two of the dangerous consorted traitors
that sought at oxford thy dire overthrow 


henry bolingbroke

thy pains  fitzwater  shall not be forgot

enter henry percy  and the bishop of carlisle


henry percy

the grand conspirator  abbot of westminster 
with clog of conscience and sour melancholy
hath yielded up his body to the grave 
but here is carlisle living  to abide
thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride 


henry bolingbroke

carlisle  this is your doom 
choose out some secret place  some reverend room 
more than thou hast  and with it joy thy life 
so as thou livest in peace  die free from strife 
for though mine enemy thou hast ever been 
high sparks of honour in thee have i seen 
enter exton  with persons bearing a coffin


exton

great king  within this coffin i present
thy buried fear  herein all breathless lies
the mightiest of thy greatest enemies 
richard of bordeaux  by me hither brought 


henry bolingbroke

exton  i thank thee not  for thou hast wrought
a deed of slander with thy fatal hand
upon my head and all this famous land 


exton

from your own mouth  my lord  did i this deed 


henry bolingbroke

they love not poison that do poison need 
nor do i thee  though i did wish him dead 
i hate the murderer  love him murdered 
the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour 
but neither my good word nor princely favour 
with cain go wander through shades of night 
and never show thy head by day nor light 
lords  i protest  my soul is full of woe 
that blood should sprinkle me to make me grow 
come  mourn with me for that i do lament 
and put on sullen black incontinent 
i make a voyage to the holy land 
to wash this blood off from my guilty hand 
march sadly after  grace my mournings here 
in weeping after this untimely bier 
exeunt
