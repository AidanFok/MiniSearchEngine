scene ii  the same  another street 


enter the corpse of king henry the sixth  gentlemen with halberds to guard it  lady anne being the mourner


lady anne

set down  set down your honourable load 
if honour may be shrouded in a hearse 
whilst i awhile obsequiously lament
the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster 
poor key cold figure of a holy king 
pale ashes of the house of lancaster 
thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood 
be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost 
to hear the lamentations of poor anne 
wife to thy edward  to thy slaughter son 
stabb by the selfsame hand that made these wounds 
lo  in these windows that let forth thy life 
i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes 
cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes 
cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it 
cursed the blood that let this blood from hence 
more direful hap betide that hated wretch 
that makes us wretched by the death of thee 
than i can wish to adders  spiders  toads 
or any creeping venom thing that lives 
if ever he have child  abortive be it 
prodigious  and untimely brought to light 
whose ugly and unnatural aspect
may fright the hopeful mother at the view 
and that be heir to his unhappiness 
if ever he have wife  let her he made
a miserable by the death of him
as i am made by my poor lord and thee 
come  now towards chertsey with your holy load 
taken from paul to be interred there 
and still  as you are weary of the weight 
rest you  whiles i lament king henry corse 
enter gloucester


gloucester

stay  you that bear the corse  and set it down 


lady anne

what black magician conjures up this fiend 
to stop devoted charitable deeds 


gloucester

villains  set down the corse  or  by saint paul 
i make a corse of him that disobeys 


gentleman

my lord  stand back  and let the coffin pass 


gloucester

unmanner dog  stand thou  when i command 
advance thy halbert higher than my breast 
or  by saint paul  i strike thee to my foot 
and spurn upon thee  beggar  for thy boldness 


lady anne

what  do you tremble  are you all afraid 
alas  i blame you not  for you are mortal 
and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil 
avaunt  thou dreadful minister of hell 
thou hadst but power over his mortal body 
his soul thou canst not have  therefore be gone 


gloucester

sweet saint  for charity  be not so curst 


lady anne

foul devil  for god sake  hence  and trouble us not 
for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell 
fill it with cursing cries and deep exclaims 
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds 
behold this pattern of thy butcheries 
o  gentlemen  see  see  dead henry wounds
open their congeal mouths and bleed afresh 
blush  blush  thou lump of foul deformity 
for  thy presence that exhales this blood
from cold and empty veins  where no blood dwells 
thy deed  inhuman and unnatural 
provokes this deluge most unnatural 
o god  which this blood madest  revenge his death 
o earth  which this blood drink revenge his death 
either heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead 
or earth  gape open wide and eat him quick 
as thou dost swallow up this good king blood
which his hell govern arm hath butchered 


gloucester

lady  you know no rules of charity 
which renders good for bad  blessings for curses 


lady anne

villain  thou know no law of god nor man 
no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity 


gloucester

but i know none  and therefore am no beast 


lady anne

o wonderful  when devils tell the truth 


gloucester

more wonderful  when angels are so angry 
vouchsafe  divine perfection of a woman 
of these supposed evils  to give me leave 
by circumstance  but to acquit myself 


lady anne

vouchsafe  defused infection of a man 
for these known evils  but to give me leave 
by circumstance  to curse thy cursed self 


gloucester

fairer than tongue can name thee  let me have
some patient leisure to excuse myself 


lady anne

fouler than heart can think thee  thou canst make
no excuse current  but to hang thyself 


gloucester

by such despair  i should accuse myself 


lady anne

and  by despairing  shouldst thou stand excused 
for doing worthy vengeance on thyself 
which didst unworthy slaughter upon others 


gloucester

say that i slew them not 


lady anne

why  then they are not dead 
but dead they are  and devilish slave  by thee 


gloucester

i did not kill your husband 


lady anne

why  then he is alive 


gloucester

nay  he is dead  and slain by edward hand 


lady anne

in thy foul throat thou liest  queen margaret saw
thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood 
the which thou once didst bend against her breast 
but that thy brothers beat aside the point 


gloucester

i was provoked by her slanderous tongue 
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders 


lady anne

thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind 
which never dreamt on aught but butcheries 
didst thou not kill this king 


gloucester

i grant ye 


lady anne

dost grant me  hedgehog  then  god grant me too
thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed 
o  he was gentle  mild  and virtuous 


gloucester

the fitter for the king of heaven  that hath him 


lady anne

he is in heaven  where thou shalt never come 


gloucester

let him thank me  that holp to send him thither 
for he was fitter for that place than earth 


lady anne

and thou unfit for any place but hell 


gloucester

yes  one place else  if you will hear me name it 


lady anne

some dungeon 


gloucester

                             your bed chamber 


lady anne

ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest 


gloucester

so will it  madam till i lie with you 


lady anne

i hope so 


gloucester

i know so  but  gentle lady anne 
to leave this keen encounter of our wits 
and fall somewhat into a slower method 
is not the causer of the timeless deaths
of these plantagenets  henry and edward 
as blameful as the executioner 


lady anne

thou art the cause  and most accursed effect 


gloucester

your beauty was the cause of that effect 
your beauty  which did haunt me in my sleep
to undertake the death of all the world 
so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom 


lady anne

if i thought that  i tell thee  homicide 
these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks 


gloucester

these eyes could never endure sweet beauty wreck 
you should not blemish it  if i stood by 
as all the world is cheered by the sun 
so i by that  it is my day  my life 


lady anne

black night o thy day  and death thy life 


gloucester

curse not thyself  fair creature thou art both 


lady anne

i would i were  to be revenged on thee 


gloucester

it is a quarrel most unnatural 
to be revenged on him that loveth you 


lady anne

it is a quarrel just and reasonable 
to be revenged on him that slew my husband 


gloucester

he that bereft thee  lady  of thy husband 
did it to help thee to a better husband 


lady anne

his better doth not breathe upon the earth 


gloucester

he lives that loves thee better than he could 


lady anne

name him 


gloucester

        plantagenet 


lady anne

why  that was he 


gloucester

the selfsame name  but one of better nature 


lady anne

where is he 


gloucester

                 here 
she spitteth at him
why dost thou spit at me 


lady anne

would it were mortal poison  for thy sake 


gloucester

never came poison from so sweet a place 


lady anne

never hung poison on a fouler toad 
out of my sight  thou dost infect my eyes 


gloucester

thine eyes  sweet lady  have infected mine 


lady anne

would they were basilisks  to strike thee dead 


gloucester

i would they were  that i might die at once 
for now they kill me with a living death 
those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears 
shamed their aspect with store of childish drops 
these eyes that never shed remorseful tear 
no  when my father york and edward wept 
to hear the piteous moan that rutland made
when black faced clifford shook his sword at him 
nor when thy warlike father  like a child 
told the sad story of my father death 
and twenty times made pause to sob and weep 
that all the standers by had wet their cheeks
like trees bedash with rain  in that sad time
my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear 
and what these sorrows could not thence exhale 
thy beauty hath  and made them blind with weeping 
i never sued to friend nor enemy 
my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word 
but now thy beauty is proposed my fee 
my proud heart sues  and prompts my tongue to speak 
she looks scornfully at him
teach not thy lips such scorn  for they were made
for kissing  lady  not for such contempt 
if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive 
lo  here i lend thee this sharp pointed sword 
which if thou please to hide in this true bosom 
and let the soul forth that adoreth thee 
i lay it naked to the deadly stroke 
and humbly beg the death upon my knee 
he lays his breast open  she offers at it with his sword
nay  do not pause  for i did kill king henry 
but  thy beauty that provoked me 
nay  now dispatch   i that stabb young edward 
but  thy heavenly face that set me on 
here she lets fall the sword
take up the sword again  or take up me 


lady anne

arise  dissembler  though i wish thy death 
i will not be the executioner 


gloucester

then bid me kill myself  and i will do it 


lady anne

i have already 


gloucester

                  tush  that was in thy rage 
speak it again  and  even with the word 
that hand  which  for thy love  did kill thy love 
shall  for thy love  kill a far truer love 
to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary 


lady anne

i would i knew thy heart 


gloucester

 figured in my tongue 


lady anne

i fear me both are false 


gloucester

then never man was true 


lady anne

well  well  put up your sword 


gloucester

say  then  my peace is made 


lady anne

that shall you know hereafter 


gloucester

but shall i live in hope 


lady anne

all men  i hope  live so 


gloucester

vouchsafe to wear this ring 


lady anne

to take is not to give 


gloucester

look  how this ring encompasseth finger 
even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart 
wear both of them  for both of them are thine 
and if thy poor devoted suppliant may
but beg one favour at thy gracious hand 
thou dost confirm his happiness for ever 


lady anne

what is it 


gloucester

that it would please thee leave these sad designs
to him that hath more cause to be a mourner 
and presently repair to crosby place 
where  after i have solemnly interr 
at chertsey monastery this noble king 
and wet his grave with my repentant tears 
i will with all expedient duty see you 
for divers unknown reasons  i beseech you 
grant me this boon 


lady anne

with all my heart  and much it joys me too 
to see you are become so penitent 
tressel and berkeley  go along with me 


gloucester

bid me farewell 


lady anne

 more than you deserve 
but since you teach me how to flatter you 
imagine i have said farewell already 
exeunt lady anne  tressel  and berkeley


gloucester

sirs  take up the corse 


gentlemen

towards chertsey  noble lord 


gloucester

no  to white friars  there attend my coining 
exeunt all but gloucester
was ever woman in this humour woo d 
was ever woman in this humour won 
i have her  but i will not keep her long 
what  i  that kill her husband and his father 
to take her in her heart extremest hate 
with curses in her mouth  tears in her eyes 
the bleeding witness of her hatred by 
having god  her conscience  and these bars
against me 
and i nothing to back my suit at all 
but the plain devil and dissembling looks 
and yet to win her  all the world to nothing 
ha 
hath she forgot already that brave prince 
edward  her lord  whom i  some three months since 
stabb in my angry mood at tewksbury 
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman 
framed in the prodigality of nature 
young  valiant  wise  and  no doubt  right royal 
the spacious world cannot again afford
and will she yet debase her eyes on me 
that cropp the golden prime of this sweet prince 
and made her widow to a woful bed 
on me  whose all not equals edward moiety 
on me  that halt and am unshapen thus 
my dukedom to a beggarly denier 
i do mistake my person all this while 
upon my life  she finds  although i cannot 
myself to be a marvellous proper man 
i be at charges for a looking glass 
and entertain some score or two of tailors 
to study fashions to adorn my body 
since i am crept in favour with myself 
will maintain it with some little cost 
but first i turn yon fellow in his grave 
and then return lamenting to my love 
shine out  fair sun  till i have bought a glass 
that i may see my shadow as i pass 
exit
