will soon recover his accustom health 


grey

in that you brook it in  it makes him worse 
therefore  for god sake  entertain good comfort 
and cheer his grace with quick and merry words 


queen elizabeth

if he were dead  what would betide of me 


rivers

no other harm but loss of such a lord 


queen elizabeth

the loss of such a lord includes all harm 


grey

the heavens have bless you with a goodly son 
to be your comforter when he is gone 


queen elizabeth

oh  he is young and his minority
is put unto the trust of richard gloucester 
a man that loves not me  nor none of you 


rivers

is it concluded that he shall be protector 


queen elizabeth

it is determined  not concluded yet 
but so it must be  if the king miscarry 
enter buckingham and derby


grey

here come the lords of buckingham and derby 


buckingham

good time of day unto your royal grace 


derby

god make your majesty joyful as you have been 


queen elizabeth

the countess richmond  good my lord of derby 
to your good prayers will scarcely say amen 
yet  derby  notwithstanding she your wife 
and loves not me  be you  good lord  assured
i hate not you for her proud arrogance 


derby

i do beseech you  either not believe
the envious slanders of her false accusers 
or  if she be accused in true report 
bear with her weakness  which  i think proceeds
from wayward sickness  and no grounded malice 


rivers

saw you the king to day  my lord of derby 


derby

but now the duke of buckingham and i
are come from visiting his majesty 


queen elizabeth

what likelihood of his amendment  lords 


buckingham

madam  good hope  his grace speaks cheerfully 


queen elizabeth

god grant him health  did you confer with him 


buckingham

madam  we did  he desires to make atonement
betwixt the duke of gloucester and your brothers 
and betwixt them and my lord chamberlain 
and sent to warn them to his royal presence 


queen elizabeth

would all were well  but that will never be
i fear our happiness is at the highest 
enter gloucester  hastings  and dorset


gloucester

they do me wrong  and i will not endure it 
who are they that complain unto the king 
that i  forsooth  am stern  and love them not 
by holy paul  they love his grace but lightly
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours 
because i cannot flatter and speak fair 
smile in men faces  smooth  deceive and cog 
duck with french nods and apish courtesy 
i must be held a rancorous enemy 
cannot a plain man live and think no harm 
but thus his simple truth must be abused
by silken  sly  insinuating jacks 


rivers

to whom in all this presence speaks your grace 


gloucester

to thee  that hast nor honesty nor grace 
when have i injured thee  when done thee wrong 
or thee  or thee  or any of your faction 
a plague upon you all  his royal person 
whom god preserve better than you would wish 
cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while 
but you must trouble him with lewd complaints 


queen elizabeth

brother of gloucester  you mistake the matter 
the king  of his own royal disposition 
and not provoked by any suitor else 
aiming  belike  at your interior hatred 
which in your outward actions shows itself
against my kindred  brothers  and myself 
makes him to send  that thereby he may gather
the ground of your ill will  and so remove it 


gloucester

i cannot tell  the world is grown so bad 
that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch 
since every jack became a gentleman
there many a gentle person made a jack 


queen elizabeth

come  come  we know your meaning  brother
gloucester 
you envy my advancement and my friends 
god grant we never may have need of you 


gloucester

meantime  god grants that we have need of you 
your brother is imprison by your means 
myself disgraced  and the nobility
held in contempt  whilst many fair promotions
are daily given to ennoble those
that scarce  some two days since  were worth a noble 


queen elizabeth

by him that raised me to this careful height
from that contented hap which i enjoy d 
i never did incense his majesty
against the duke of clarence  but have been
an earnest advocate to plead for him 
my lord  you do me shameful injury 
falsely to draw me in these vile suspects 


gloucester

you may deny that you were not the cause
of my lord hastings  late imprisonment 


rivers

she may  my lord  for 


gloucester

she may  lord rivers  why  who knows not so 
she may do more  sir  than denying that 
she may help you to many fair preferments 
and then deny her aiding hand therein 
and lay those honours on your high deserts 
what may she not  she may  yea  marry  may she 


rivers

what  marry  may she 


gloucester

what  marry  may she  marry with a king 
a bachelor  a handsome stripling too 
i wis your grandam had a worser match 


queen elizabeth

my lord of gloucester  i have too long borne
your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs 
by heaven  i will acquaint his majesty
with those gross taunts i often have endured 
i had rather be a country servant maid
than a great queen  with this condition 
to be thus taunted  scorn d  and baited at 
enter queen margaret  behind
small joy have i in being england queen 


queen margaret

and lessen be that small  god  i beseech thee 
thy honour  state and seat is due to me 


gloucester

what  threat you me with telling of the king 
tell him  and spare not  look  what i have said
i will avouch in presence of the king 
i dare adventure to be sent to the tower 
 time to speak  my pains are quite forgot 


queen margaret

out  devil  i remember them too well 
thou slewest my husband henry in the tower 
and edward  my poor son  at tewksbury 


gloucester

ere you were queen  yea  or your husband king 
i was a pack horse in his great affairs 
a weeder out of his proud adversaries 
a liberal rewarder of his friends 
to royalize his blood i spilt mine own 


queen margaret

yea  and much better blood than his or thine 


gloucester

in all which time you and your husband grey
were factious for the house of lancaster 
and  rivers  so were you  was not your husband
in margaret battle at saint alban slain 
let me put in your minds  if you forget 
what you have been ere now  and what you are 
withal  what i have been  and what i am 


queen margaret

a murderous villain  and so still thou art 


gloucester

poor clarence did forsake his father  warwick 
yea  and forswore himself which jesu pardon 


queen margaret

which god revenge 


gloucester

to fight on edward party for the crown 
and for his meed  poor lord  he is mew up 
i would to god my heart were flint  like edward s 
or edward soft and pitiful  like mine
i am too childish foolish for this world 


queen margaret

hie thee to hell for shame  and leave the world 
thou cacodemon  there thy kingdom is 


rivers

my lord of gloucester  in those busy days
which here you urge to prove us enemies 
we follow then our lord  our lawful king 
so should we you  if you should be our king 


gloucester

if i should be  i had rather be a pedlar 
far be it from my heart  the thought of it 


queen elizabeth

as little joy  my lord  as you suppose
you should enjoy  were you this country king 
as little joy may you suppose in me 
that i enjoy  being the queen thereof 


queen margaret

a little joy enjoys the queen thereof 
for i am she  and altogether joyless 
i can no longer hold me patient 
advancing
hear me  you wrangling pirates  that fall out
in sharing that which you have pill from me 
which of you trembles not that looks on me 
if not  that  i being queen  you bow like subjects 
yet that  by you deposed  you quake like rebels 
o gentle villain  do not turn away 


gloucester

foul wrinkled witch  what makest thou in my sight 


queen margaret

but repetition of what thou hast marr d 
that will i make before i let thee go 


gloucester

wert thou not banished on pain of death 


queen margaret

i was  but i do find more pain in banishment
than death can yield me here by my abode 
a husband and a son thou owest to me 
and thou a kingdom  all of you allegiance 
the sorrow that i have  by right is yours 
and all the pleasures you usurp are mine 


gloucester

the curse my noble father laid on thee 
when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
and with thy scorns drew rivers from his eyes 
and then  to dry them  gavest the duke a clout
steep in the faultless blood of pretty rutland 
his curses  then from bitterness of soul
denounced against thee  are all fall upon thee 
and god  not we  hath plagued thy bloody deed 


queen elizabeth

so just is god  to right the innocent 


hastings

o   the foulest deed to slay that babe 
and the most merciless that e was heard of 


rivers

tyrants themselves wept when it was reported 


dorset

no man but prophesied revenge for it 


buckingham

northumberland  then present  wept to see it 


queen margaret

what were you snarling all before i came 
ready to catch each other by the throat 
and turn you all your hatred now on me 
did york dread curse prevail so much with heaven 
that henry death  my lovely edward death 
their kingdom loss  my woful banishment 
could all but answer for that peevish brat 
can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven 
why  then  give way  dull clouds  to my quick curses 
if not by war  by surfeit die your king 
as ours by murder  to make him a king 
edward thy son  which now is prince of wales 
for edward my son  which was prince of wales 
die in his youth by like untimely violence 
thyself a queen  for me that was a queen 
outlive thy glory  like my wretched self 
long mayst thou live to wail thy children loss 
and see another  as i see thee now 
deck in thy rights  as thou art stall in mine 
long die thy happy days before thy death 
and  after many lengthen hours of grief 
die neither mother  wife  nor england queen 
rivers and dorset  you were standers by 
and so wast thou  lord hastings  when my son
was stabb with bloody daggers  god  i pray him 
that none of you may live your natural age 
but by some unlook accident cut off 


gloucester

have done thy charm  thou hateful wither hag 


queen margaret

and leave out thee  stay  dog  for thou shalt hear me 
if heaven have any grievous plague in store
exceeding those that i can wish upon thee 
o  let them keep it till thy sins be ripe 
and then hurl down their indignation
on thee  the troubler of the poor world peace 
the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul 
thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest 
and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends 
no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine 
unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils 
thou elvish mark d  abortive  rooting hog 
thou that wast seal in thy nativity
the slave of nature and the son of hell 
thou slander of thy mother heavy womb 
thou loathed issue of thy father loins 
thou rag of honour  thou detested 


gloucester

margaret 


queen margaret

        richard 


gloucester

                  ha 


queen margaret

                  i call thee not 


gloucester

i cry thee mercy then  for i had thought
that thou hadst call me all these bitter names 


queen margaret

why  so i did  but look for no reply 
o  let me make the period to my curse 


gloucester

 done by me  and ends in  margaret 


queen elizabeth

thus have you breathed your curse against yourself 


queen margaret

poor painted queen  vain flourish of my fortune 
why strew thou sugar on that bottled spider 
whose deadly web ensnareth thee about 
fool  fool  thou whet a knife to kill thyself 
the time will come when thou shalt wish for me
to help thee curse that poisonous bunchback toad 


hastings

false boding woman  end thy frantic curse 
lest to thy harm thou move our patience 


queen margaret

foul shame upon you  you have all moved mine 


rivers

were you well served  you would be taught your duty 


queen margaret

to serve me well  you all should do me duty 
teach me to be your queen  and you my subjects 
o  serve me well  and teach yourselves that duty 


dorset

dispute not with her  she is lunatic 


queen margaret

peace  master marquess  you are malapert 
your fire new stamp of honour is scarce current 
o  that your young nobility could judge
what  to lose it  and be miserable 
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them 
and if they fall  they dash themselves to pieces 


gloucester

good counsel  marry  learn it  learn it  marquess 


dorset

it toucheth you  my lord  as much as me 


gloucester

yea  and much more  but i was born so high 
our aery buildeth in the cedar top 
and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun 


queen margaret

and turns the sun to shade  alas  alas 
witness my son  now in the shade of death 
whose bright out shining beams thy cloudy wrath
hath in eternal darkness folded up 
your aery buildeth in our aery nest 
o god  that seest it  do not suffer it 
as it was won with blood  lost be it so 


buckingham

have done  for shame  if not for charity 


queen margaret

urge neither charity nor shame to me 
uncharitably with me have you dealt 
and shamefully by you my hopes are butcher d 
my charity is outrage  life my shame
and in that shame still live my sorrow rage 


buckingham

have done  have done 


queen margaret

o princely buckingham i kiss thy hand 
in sign of league and amity with thee 
now fair befal thee and thy noble house 
thy garments are not spotted with our blood 
nor thou within the compass of my curse 


buckingham

nor no one here  for curses never pass
the lips of those that breathe them in the air 


queen margaret

i not believe but they ascend the sky 
and there awake god gentle sleeping peace 
o buckingham  take heed of yonder dog 
look  when he fawns  he bites  and when he bites 
his venom tooth will rankle to the death 
have not to do with him  beware of him 
sin  death  and hell have set their marks on him 
and all their ministers attend on him 


gloucester

what doth she say  my lord of buckingham 


buckingham

nothing that i respect  my gracious lord 


queen margaret

what  dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel 
and soothe the devil that i warn thee from 
o  but remember this another day 
when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow 
and say poor margaret was a prophetess 
live each of you the subjects to his hate 
and he to yours  and all of you to god s 
exit


hastings

my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses 


rivers

and so doth mine  i muse why she at liberty 


gloucester

i cannot blame her  by god holy mother 
she hath had too much wrong  and i repent
my part thereof that i have done to her 


queen elizabeth

i never did her any  to my knowledge 


gloucester

but you have all the vantage of her wrong 
i was too hot to do somebody good 
that is too cold in thinking of it now 
marry  as for clarence  he is well repaid 
he is frank up to fatting for his pains
god pardon them that are the cause of it 


rivers

a virtuous and a christian like conclusion 
to pray for them that have done scathe to us 


gloucester

so do i ever 
aside
being well advised 
for had i cursed now  i had cursed myself 
enter catesby


catesby

madam  his majesty doth call for you 
and for your grace  and you  my noble lords 


queen elizabeth

catesby  we come  lords  will you go with us 


rivers

madam  we will attend your grace 
exeunt all but gloucester


gloucester

i do the wrong  and first begin to brawl 
the secret mischiefs that i set abroach
i lay unto the grievous charge of others 
clarence  whom i  indeed  have laid in darkness 
i do beweep to many simple gulls
namely  to hastings  derby  buckingham 
and say it is the queen and her allies
that stir the king against the duke my brother 
now  they believe it  and withal whet me
to be revenged on rivers  vaughan  grey 
but then i sigh  and  with a piece of scripture 
tell them that god bids us do good for evil 
and thus i clothe my naked villany
with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ 
and seem a saint  when most i play the devil 
enter two murderers
but  soft  here come my executioners 
how now  my hardy  stout resolved mates 
are you now going to dispatch this deed 


first murderer

we are  my lord  and come to have the warrant
that we may be admitted where he is 


gloucester

well thought upon  i have it here about me 
gives the warrant
when you have done  repair to crosby place 
but  sirs  be sudden in the execution 
withal obdurate  do not hear him plead 
for clarence is well spoken  and perhaps
may move your hearts to pity if you mark him 


first murderer

tush 
fear not  my lord  we will not stand to prate 
talkers are no good doers  be assured
we come to use our hands and not our tongues 


gloucester

your eyes drop millstones  when fools  eyes drop tears 
i like you  lads  about your business straight 
go  go  dispatch 


first murderer

                  we will  my noble lord 
exeunt
