enter clarence and brakenbury


brakenbury

why looks your grace so heavily today 


clarence

o  i have pass a miserable night 
so full of ugly sights  of ghastly dreams 
that  as i am a christian faithful man 
i would not spend another such a night 
though  to buy a world of happy days 
so full of dismal terror was the time 


brakenbury

what was your dream  i long to hear you tell it 


clarence

methoughts that i had broken from the tower 
and was embark to cross to burgundy 
and  in my company  my brother gloucester 
who from my cabin tempted me to walk
upon the hatches  thence we looked toward england 
and cited up a thousand fearful times 
during the wars of york and lancaster
that had befall us  as we paced along
upon the giddy footing of the hatches 
methought that gloucester stumbled  and  in falling 
struck me  that thought to stay him  overboard 
into the tumbling billows of the main 
lord  lord  methought  what pain it was to drown 
what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears 
what ugly sights of death within mine eyes 
methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks 
ten thousand men that fishes gnaw upon 
wedges of gold  great anchors  heaps of pearl 
inestimable stones  unvalued jewels 
all scatter in the bottom of the sea 
some lay in dead men skulls  and  in those holes
where eyes did once inhabit  there were crept 
as  in scorn of eyes  reflecting gems 
which woo the slimy bottom of the deep 
and mock the dead bones that lay scatter by 


brakenbury

had you such leisure in the time of death
to gaze upon the secrets of the deep 


clarence

methought i had  and often did i strive
to yield the ghost  but still the envious flood
kept in my soul  and would not let it forth
to seek the empty  vast and wandering air 
but smother it within my panting bulk 
which almost burst to belch it in the sea 


brakenbury

awaked you not with this sore agony 


clarence

o  no  my dream was lengthen after life 
o  then began the tempest to my soul 
who pass d  methought  the melancholy flood 
with that grim ferryman which poets write of 
unto the kingdom of perpetual night 
the first that there did greet my stranger soul 
was my great father in law  renowned warwick 
who cried aloud   scourge for perjury
can this dark monarchy afford false clarence 
and so he vanish d  then came wandering by
a shadow like an angel  with bright hair
dabbled in blood  and he squeak out aloud 
 is come  false  fleeting  perjured clarence 
that stabb me in the field by tewksbury 
seize on him  furies  take him to your torments 
with that  methoughts  a legion of foul fiends
environ me about  and howled in mine ears
such hideous cries  that with the very noise
i trembling waked  and for a season after
could not believe but that i was in hell 
such terrible impression made the dream 


brakenbury

no marvel  my lord  though it affrighted you 
i promise  i am afraid to hear you tell it 


clarence

o brakenbury  i have done those things 
which now bear evidence against my soul 
for edward sake  and see how he requites me 
o god  if my deep prayers cannot appease thee 
but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds 
yet execute thy wrath in me alone 
o  spare my guiltless wife and my poor children 
i pray thee  gentle keeper  stay by me 
my soul is heavy  and i fain would sleep 


brakenbury

i will  my lord  god give your grace good rest 
clarence sleeps
sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours 
makes the night morning  and the noon tide night 
princes have but their tides for their glories 
an outward honour for an inward toil 
and  for unfelt imagination 
they often feel a world of restless cares 
so that  betwixt their tides and low names 
there nothing differs but the outward fame 
enter the two murderers


first murderer

ho  who here 


brakenbury

in god name what are you  and how came you hither 


first murderer

i would speak with clarence  and i came hither on my legs 


brakenbury

yea  are you so brief 


second murderer

o sir  it is better to be brief than tedious  show
him our commission  talk no more 
brakenbury reads it


brakenbury

i am  in this  commanded to deliver
the noble duke of clarence to your hands 
i will not reason what is meant hereby 
because i will be guiltless of the meaning 
here are the keys  there sits the duke asleep 
i to the king  and signify to him
that thus i have resign my charge to you 


first murderer

do so  it is a point of wisdom  fare you well 
exit brakenbury


second murderer

what  shall we stab him as he sleeps 


first murderer

no  then he will say  done cowardly  when he wakes 


second murderer

when he wakes  why  fool  he shall never wake till
the judgment day 


first murderer

why  then he will say we stabbed him sleeping 


second murderer

the urging of that word  judgment  hath bred a kind
of remorse in me 


first murderer

what  art thou afraid 


second murderer

not to kill him  having a warrant for it  but to be
damned for killing him  from which no warrant can defend us 


first murderer

i thought thou hadst been resolute 


second murderer

so i am  to let him live 


first murderer

back to the duke of gloucester  tell him so 


second murderer

i pray thee  stay a while  i hope my holy humour
will change   wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty 


first murderer

how dost thou feel thyself now 


second murderer

 faith  some certain dregs of conscience are yet
within me 


first murderer

remember our reward  when the deed is done 


second murderer

 zounds  he dies  i had forgot the reward 


first murderer

where is thy conscience now 


second murderer

in the duke of gloucester purse 


first murderer

so when he opens his purse to give us our reward 
thy conscience flies out 


second murderer

let it go  there few or none will entertain it 


first murderer

how if it come to thee again 


second murderer

i not meddle with it  it is a dangerous thing  it
makes a man a coward  a man cannot steal  but it
accuseth him  he cannot swear  but it cheques him 
he cannot lie with his neighbour wife  but it
detects him   a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man bosom  it fills one full of
obstacles  it made me once restore a purse of gold
that i found  it beggars any man that keeps it  it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing  and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it 


first murderer

 zounds  it is even now at my elbow  persuading me
not to kill the duke 


second murderer

take the devil in thy mind  and relieve him not  he
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh 


first murderer

tut  i am strong framed  he cannot prevail with me 
i warrant thee 


second murderer

spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation  come  shall we to this gear 


first murderer

take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword  and then we will chop him in the malmsey butt
in the next room 


second murderer

o excellent devise  make a sop of him 


first murderer

hark  he stirs  shall i strike 


second murderer

no  first let reason with him 


clarence

where art thou  keeper  give me a cup of wine 


second murderer

you shall have wine enough  my lord  anon 


clarence

in god name  what art thou 


second murderer

a man  as you are 


clarence

but not  as i am  royal 


second murderer

nor you  as we are  loyal 


clarence

thy voice is thunder  but thy looks are humble 


second murderer

my voice is now the king s  my looks mine own 


clarence

how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak 
your eyes do menace me  why look you pale 
who sent you hither  wherefore do you come 


both

to  to  to 


clarence

to murder me 


both

ay  ay 


clarence

you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so 
and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it 
wherein  my friends  have i offended you 


first murderer

offended us you have not  but the king 


clarence

i shall be reconciled to him again 


second murderer

never  my lord  therefore prepare to die 


clarence

are you call forth from out a world of men
to slay the innocent  what is my offence 
where are the evidence that do accuse me 
what lawful quest have given their verdict up
unto the frowning judge  or who pronounced
the bitter sentence of poor clarence  death 
before i be convict by course of law 
to threaten me with death is most unlawful 
i charge you  as you hope to have redemption
by christ dear blood shed for our grievous sins 
that you depart and lay no hands on me
the deed you undertake is damnable 


first murderer

what we will do  we do upon command 


second murderer

and he that hath commanded is the king 


clarence

erroneous vassal  the great king of kings
hath in the tables of his law commanded
that thou shalt do no murder  and wilt thou  then 
spurn at his edict and fulfil a man s 
take heed  for he holds vengeance in his hands 
to hurl upon their heads that break his law 


second murderer

and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee 
for false forswearing and for murder too 
thou didst receive the holy sacrament 
to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster 


first murderer

and  like a traitor to the name of god 
didst break that vow  and with thy treacherous blade
unrip the bowels of thy sovereign son 


second murderer

whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend 


first murderer

how canst thou urge god dreadful law to us 
when thou hast broke it in so dear degree 


clarence

alas  for whose sake did i that ill deed 
for edward  for my brother  for his sake  why  sirs 
he sends ye not to murder me for this
for in this sin he is as deep as i 
if god will be revenged for this deed 
o  know you yet  he doth it publicly 
take not the quarrel from his powerful arm 
he needs no indirect nor lawless course
to cut off those that have offended him 


first murderer

who made thee  then  a bloody minister 
when gallant springing brave plantagenet 
that princely novice  was struck dead by thee 


clarence

my brother love  the devil  and my rage 


first murderer

thy brother love  our duty  and thy fault 
provoke us hither now to slaughter thee 


clarence

oh  if you love my brother  hate not me 
i am his brother  and i love him well 
if you be hired for meed  go back again 
and i will send you to my brother gloucester 
who shall reward you better for my life
than edward will for tidings of my death 


second murderer

you are deceived  your brother gloucester hates you 


clarence

o  no  he loves me  and he holds me dear 
go you to him from me 


both

ay  so we will 


clarence

tell him  when that our princely father york
bless his three sons with his victorious arm 
and charged us from his soul to love each other 
he little thought of this divided friendship 
bid gloucester think of this  and he will weep 


first murderer

ay  millstones  as be lesson us to weep 


clarence

o  do not slander him  for he is kind 


first murderer

right 
as snow in harvest  thou deceivest thyself 
 he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee 


clarence

it cannot be  for when i parted with him 
he hugg me in his arms  and swore  with sobs 
that he would labour my delivery 


second murderer

why  so he doth  now he delivers thee
from this world thraldom to the joys of heaven 


first murderer

make peace with god  for you must die  my lord 


clarence

hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul 
to counsel me to make my peace with god 
and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind 
that thou wilt war with god by murdering me 
ah  sirs  consider  he that set you on
to do this deed will hate you for the deed 


second murderer

what shall we do 


clarence

                  relent  and save your souls 


first murderer

relent   cowardly and womanish 


clarence

not to relent is beastly  savage  devilish 
which of you  if you were a prince son 
being pent from liberty  as i am now 
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you 
would not entreat for life 
my friend  i spy some pity in thy looks 
o  if thine eye be not a flatterer 
come thou on my side  and entreat for me 
as you would beg  were you in my distress
a begging prince what beggar pities not 


second murderer

look behind you  my lord 


first murderer

take that  and that  if all this will not do 
stabs him
i drown you in the malmsey butt within 
exit  with the body


second murderer

a bloody deed  and desperately dispatch d 
how fain  like pilate  would i wash my hands
of this most grievous guilty murder done 
re enter first murderer


first murderer

how now  what mean thou  that thou help me not 
by heavens  the duke shall know how slack thou art 


second murderer

i would he knew that i had saved his brother 
take thou the fee  and tell him what i say 
for i repent me that the duke is slain 
exit


first murderer

so do not i  go  coward as thou art 
now must i hide his body in some hole 
until the duke take order for his burial 
and when i have my meed  i must away 
for this will out  and here i must not stay
