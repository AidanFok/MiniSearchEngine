scene i  london  the palace 


flourish  enter king edward iv sick  queen  elizabeth  dorset  rivers  hastings  buckingham  grey  and others


king edward iv

why  so  now have i done a good day work 
you peers  continue this united league 
i every day expect an embassage
from my redeemer to redeem me hence 
and now in peace my soul shall part to heaven 
since i have set my friends at peace on earth 
rivers and hastings  take each other hand 
dissemble not your hatred  swear your love 


rivers

by heaven  my heart is purged from grudging hate 
and with my hand i seal my true heart love 


hastings

so thrive i  as i truly swear the like 


king edward iv

take heed you dally not before your king 
lest he that is the supreme king of kings
confound your hidden falsehood  and award
either of you to be the other end 


hastings

so prosper i  as i swear perfect love 


rivers

and i  as i love hastings with my heart 


king edward iv

madam  yourself are not exempt in this 
nor your son dorset  buckingham  nor you 
you have been factious one against the other 
wife  love lord hastings  let him kiss your hand 
and what you do  do it unfeignedly 


queen elizabeth

here  hastings  i will never more remember
our former hatred  so thrive i and mine 


king edward iv

dorset  embrace him  hastings  love lord marquess 


dorset

this interchange of love  i here protest 
upon my part shall be unviolable 


hastings

and so swear i  my lord
they embrace


king edward iv

now  princely buckingham  seal thou this league
with thy embracements to my wife allies 
and make me happy in your unity 


buckingham

whenever buckingham doth turn his hate
on you or yours 
to the queen
but with all duteous love
doth cherish you and yours  god punish me
with hate in those where i expect most love 
when i have most need to employ a friend 
and most assured that he is a friend
deep  hollow  treacherous  and full of guile 
be he unto me  this do i beg of god 
when i am cold in zeal to yours 


king edward iv

a pleasing cordial  princely buckingham 
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart 
there wanteth now our brother gloucester here 
to make the perfect period of this peace 


buckingham

and  in good time  here comes the noble duke 
enter gloucester


gloucester

good morrow to my sovereign king and queen 
and  princely peers  a happy time of day 


king edward iv

happy  indeed  as we have spent the day 
brother  we done deeds of charity 
made peace enmity  fair love of hate 
between these swelling wrong incensed peers 


gloucester

a blessed labour  my most sovereign liege 
amongst this princely heap  if any here 
by false intelligence  or wrong surmise 
hold me a foe 
if i unwittingly  or in my rage 
have aught committed that is hardly borne
by any in this presence  i desire
to reconcile me to his friendly peace 
 death to me to be at enmity 
i hate it  and desire all good men love 
first  madam  i entreat true peace of you 
which i will purchase with my duteous service 
of you  my noble cousin buckingham 
if ever any grudge were lodged between us 
of you  lord rivers  and  lord grey  of you 
that without desert have frown on me 
dukes  earls  lords  gentlemen  indeed  of all 
i do not know that englishman alive
with whom my soul is any jot at odds
more than the infant that is born to night
i thank my god for my humility 


queen elizabeth

a holy day shall this be kept hereafter 
i would to god all strifes were well compounded 
my sovereign liege  i do beseech your majesty
to take our brother clarence to your grace 


gloucester

why  madam  have i offer love for this
to be so bouted in this royal presence 
who knows not that the noble duke is dead 
they all start
you do him injury to scorn his corse 


rivers

who knows not he is dead  who knows he is 


queen elizabeth

all seeing heaven  what a world is this 


buckingham

look i so pale  lord dorset  as the rest 


dorset

ay  my good lord  and no one in this presence
but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks 


king edward iv

is clarence dead  the order was reversed 


gloucester

but he  poor soul  by your first order died 
and that a winged mercury did bear 
some tardy cripple bore the countermand 
that came too lag to see him buried 
god grant that some  less noble and less loyal 
nearer in bloody thoughts  but not in blood 
deserve not worse than wretched clarence did 
and yet go current from suspicion 
enter derby


derby

a boon  my sovereign  for my service done 


king edward iv

i pray thee  peace  my soul is full of sorrow 


derby

i will not rise  unless your highness grant 


king edward iv

then speak at once what is it thou demand st 


derby

the forfeit  sovereign  of my servant life 
who slew to day a righteous gentleman
lately attendant on the duke of norfolk 


king edward iv

have a tongue to doom my brother death 
and shall the same give pardon to a slave 
my brother slew no man  his fault was thought 
and yet his punishment was cruel death 
who sued to me for him  who  in my rage 
kneel at my feet  and bade me be advised
who spake of brotherhood  who spake of love 
who told me how the poor soul did forsake
the mighty warwick  and did fight for me 
who told me  in the field by tewksbury
when oxford had me down  he rescued me 
and said   brother  live  and be a king 
who told me  when we both lay in the field
frozen almost to death  how he did lap me
even in his own garments  and gave himself 
all thin and naked  to the numb cold night 
all this from my remembrance brutish wrath
sinfully pluck d  and not a man of you
had so much grace to put it in my mind 
but when your carters or your waiting vassals
have done a drunken slaughter  and defaced
the precious image of our dear redeemer 
you straight are on your knees for pardon  pardon 
and i unjustly too  must grant it you
but for my brother not a man would speak 
nor i  ungracious  speak unto myself
for him  poor soul  the proudest of you all
have been beholding to him in his life 
yet none of you would once plead for his life 
o god  i fear thy justice will take hold
on me  and you  and mine  and yours for this 
come  hastings  help me to my closet 
oh  poor clarence 
exeunt some with king edward iv and queen margaret


gloucester

this is the fruit of rashness  mark you not
how that the guilty kindred of the queen
look pale when they did hear of clarence  death 
o  they did urge it still unto the king 
god will revenge it  but come  let us in 
to comfort edward with our company 


buckingham

we wait upon your grace 
exeunt
