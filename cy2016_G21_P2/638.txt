enter the duchess of york  with the two children of clarence


boy

tell me  good grandam  is our father dead 


duchess of york

no  boy 


boy

why do you wring your hands  and beat your breast 
and cry  clarence  my unhappy son 


girl

why do you look on us  and shake your head 
and call us wretches  orphans  castaways
if that our noble father be alive 


duchess of york

my pretty cousins  you mistake me much 
i do lament the sickness of the king 
as loath to lose him  not your father death 
it were lost sorrow to wail one that lost 


boy

then  grandam  you conclude that he is dead 
the king my uncle is to blame for this 
god will revenge it  whom i will importune
with daily prayers all to that effect 


girl

and so will i 


duchess of york

peace  children  peace  the king doth love you well 
incapable and shallow innocents 
you cannot guess who caused your father death 


boy

grandam  we can  for my good uncle gloucester
told me  the king  provoked by the queen 
devised impeachments to imprison him  
and when my uncle told me so  he wept 
and hugg me in his arm  and kindly kiss my cheek 
bade me rely on him as on my father 
and he would love me dearly as his child 


duchess of york

oh  that deceit should steal such gentle shapes 
and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile 
he is my son  yea  and therein my shame 
yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit 


boy

think you my uncle did dissemble  grandam 


duchess of york

ay  boy 


boy

i cannot think it  hark  what noise is this 
enter queen elizabeth  with her hair about her ears  rivers  and dorset after her


queen elizabeth

oh  who shall hinder me to wail and weep 
to chide my fortune  and torment myself 
i join with black despair against my soul 
and to myself become an enemy 


duchess of york

what means this scene of rude impatience 


queen elizabeth

to make an act of tragic violence 
edward  my lord  your son  our king  is dead 
why grow the branches now the root is wither d 
why wither not the leaves the sap being gone 
if you will live  lament  if die  be brief 
that our swift winged souls may catch the king s 
or  like obedient subjects  follow him
to his new kingdom of perpetual rest 


duchess of york

ah  so much interest have i in thy sorrow
as i had title in thy noble husband 
i have bewept a worthy husband death 
and lived by looking on his images 
but now two mirrors of his princely semblance
are crack in pieces by malignant death 
and i for comfort have but one false glass 
which grieves me when i see my shame in him 
thou art a widow  yet thou art a mother 
and hast the comfort of thy children left thee 
but death hath snatch my husband from mine arms 
and pluck two crutches from my feeble limbs 
edward and clarence  o  what cause have i 
thine being but a moiety of my grief 
to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries 


boy

good aunt  you wept not for our father death 
how can we aid you with our kindred tears 


girl

our fatherless distress was left unmoan d 
your widow dolour likewise be unwept 


queen elizabeth

give me no help in lamentation 
i am not barren to bring forth complaints
all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes 
that i  being govern by the watery moon 
may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world 
oh for my husband  for my dear lord edward 


children

oh for our father  for our dear lord clarence 


duchess of york

alas for both  both mine  edward and clarence 


queen elizabeth

what stay had i but edward  and he gone 


children

what stay had we but clarence  and he gone 


duchess of york

what stays had i but they  and they are gone 


queen elizabeth

was never widow had so dear a loss 


children

were never orphans had so dear a loss 


duchess of york

was never mother had so dear a loss 
alas  i am the mother of these moans 
their woes are parcell d  mine are general 
she for an edward weeps  and so do i 
i for a clarence weep  so doth not she 
these babes for clarence weep and so do i 
i for an edward weep  so do not they 
alas  you three  on me  threefold distress d 
pour all your tears  i am your sorrow nurse 
and i will pamper it with lamentations 


dorset

comfort  dear mother  god is much displeased
that you take with unthankfulness  his doing 
in common worldly things   call ungrateful 
with dull unwilligness to repay a debt
which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent 
much more to be thus opposite with heaven 
for it requires the royal debt it lent you 


rivers

madam  bethink you  like a careful mother 
of the young prince your son  send straight for him
let him be crown d  in him your comfort lives 
drown desperate sorrow in dead edward grave 
and plant your joys in living edward throne 
enter gloucester  buckingham  derby  hastings  and ratcliff


gloucester

madam  have comfort  all of us have cause
to wail the dimming of our shining star 
but none can cure their harms by wailing them 
madam  my mother  i do cry you mercy 
i did not see your grace  humbly on my knee
i crave your blessing 


duchess of york

god bless thee  and put meekness in thy mind 
love  charity  obedience  and true duty 


gloucester

 aside   amen  and make me die a good old man 
that is the butt end of a mother blessing 
i marvel why her grace did leave it out 


buckingham

you cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers 
that bear this mutual heavy load of moan 
now cheer each other in each other love
though we have spent our harvest of this king 
we are to reap the harvest of his son 
the broken rancour of your high swoln hearts 
but lately splinter d  knit  and join together 
must gently be preserved  cherish d  and kept 
me seemeth good  that  with some little train 
forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetch 
hither to london  to be crown our king 


rivers

why with some little train  my lord of buckingham 


buckingham

marry  my lord  lest  by a multitude 
the new heal wound of malice should break out 
which would be so much the more dangerous
by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern d 
where every horse bears his commanding rein 
and may direct his course as please himself 
as well the fear of harm  as harm apparent 
in my opinion  ought to be prevented 


gloucester

i hope the king made peace with all of us
and the compact is firm and true in me 


rivers

and so in me  and so  i think  in all 
yet  since it is but green  it should be put
to no apparent likelihood of breach 
which haply by much company might be urged 
therefore i say with noble buckingham 
that it is meet so few should fetch the prince 


hastings

and so say i 


gloucester

then be it so  and go we to determine
who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow 
madam  and you  my mother  will you go
to give your censures in this weighty business 


queen elizabeth

duchess of york

with all our harts 
exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester


buckingham

my lord  whoever journeys to the prince 
for god sake  let not us two be behind 
for  by the way  i sort occasion 
as index to the story we late talk of 
to part the queen proud kindred from the king 


gloucester

my other self  my counsel consistory 
my oracle  my prophet  my dear cousin 
i  like a child  will go by thy direction 
towards ludlow then  for we not stay behind 
exeunt
