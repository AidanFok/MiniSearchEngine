scene iii  london  a street 


enter two citizens meeting


first citizen

neighbour  well met  whither away so fast 


second citizen

i promise you  i scarcely know myself 
hear you the news abroad 


first citizen

ay  that the king is dead 


second citizen

bad news  by lady  seldom comes the better 
i fear  i fear  prove a troublous world 
enter another citizen


third citizen

neighbours  god speed 


first citizen

give you good morrow  sir 


third citizen

doth this news hold of good king edward death 


second citizen

ay  sir  it is too true  god help the while 


third citizen

then  masters  look to see a troublous world 


first citizen

no  no  by god good grace his son shall reign 


third citizen

woe to the land that govern by a child 


second citizen

in him there is a hope of government 
that in his nonage council under him 
and in his full and ripen years himself 
no doubt  shall then and till then govern well 


first citizen

so stood the state when henry the sixth
was crown in paris but at nine months old 


third citizen

stood the state so  no  no  good friends  god wot 
for then this land was famously enrich 
with politic grave counsel  then the king
had virtuous uncles to protect his grace 


first citizen

why  so hath this  both by the father and mother 


third citizen

better it were they all came by the father 
or by the father there were none at all 
for emulation now  who shall be nearest 
will touch us all too near  if god prevent not 
o  full of danger is the duke of gloucester 
and the queen sons and brothers haught and proud 
and were they to be ruled  and not to rule 
this sickly land might solace as before 


first citizen

come  come  we fear the worst  all shall be well 


third citizen

when clouds appear  wise men put on their cloaks 
when great leaves fall  the winter is at hand 
when the sun sets  who doth not look for night 
untimely storms make men expect a dearth 
all may be well  but  if god sort it so 
 more than we deserve  or i expect 


second citizen

truly  the souls of men are full of dread 
ye cannot reason almost with a man
that looks not heavily and full of fear 


third citizen

before the times of change  still is it so 
by a divine instinct men minds mistrust
ensuing dangers  as by proof  we see
the waters swell before a boisterous storm 
but leave it all to god  whither away 


second citizen

marry  we were sent for to the justices 


third citizen

and so was i  i bear you company 
exeunt
