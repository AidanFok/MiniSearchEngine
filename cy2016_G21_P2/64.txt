falstaff

come here  pistol  stand behind me  o  if i had had
time to have made new liveries  i would have
bestowed the thousand pound i borrowed of you  but
 no matter  this poor show doth better  this
doth infer the zeal i had to see him 


shallow

it doth so 


falstaff

it shows my earnestness of affection

deliberate  not to remember  not to have patience
to shift me 


shallow

it is best  certain 


falstaff

but to stand stained with travel  and sweating with
desire to see him  thinking of nothing else 
putting all affairs else in oblivion  as if there
were nothing else to be done but to see him 


pistol

 idem  for  hoc nihil est 
 all in every part 


shallow

 so  indeed

and make thee rage 
thy doll  and helen of thy noble thoughts 
is in base durance and contagious prison 
haled thither
by most mechanical and dirty hand 
rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell
alecto snake 
for doll is in  pistol speaks nought but truth 


falstaff

i will deliver her 
shouts within  and the trumpets sound

king henry iv

i know thee not  old man  fall to thy prayers 
how ill white hairs become a fool and jester 
i have long dream of such a kind of man 
so surfeit swell d  so old and so profane 
but  being awaked  i do despise my dream 
make less thy body hence  and more thy grace 
leave gormandizing  know the grave doth gape
for thee thrice wider than for other men 
reply not to me with a fool born jest 
presume not that i am the thing i was 
for god doth know  so shall the world perceive 
that i have turn away my former self 
so will i those that kept me company 
when thou dost hear i am as i have been 
approach me  and thou shalt be as thou wast 
the tutor and the feeder of my riots 
till then  i banish thee  on pain of death 
as i have done the rest of my misleaders 
not to come near our person by ten mile 
for competence of life i will allow you 
that lack of means enforce you not to evil 
and  as we hear you do reform yourselves 
we will  according to your strengths and qualities 
give you advancement  be it your charge  my lord 
to see perform the tenor of our word  set on 
exeunt king henry v     c

grieve at this  i shall be sent for in private to
him  look you  he must seem thus to the world 
fear not your advancements  i will be the man yet
that shall make you great 


shallow

i cannot well perceive how  unless you should give
me your doublet and stuff me out with straw  i
beseech you  good sir john  let me have five hundred
of my thousand 


falstaff

sir  i will be as good as my word  this that you
heard was but a colour 


shallow

a colour that i fear you will die in  sir john 


falstaff

fear no colours  go  with me to dinner  come 
lieutenant pistol  come  bardolph  i shall be sent
for soon at night

epilogue
spoken by a dancer
first my fear  then my courtesy  last my speech 
my fear is  your displeasure  my courtesy  my duty 
and my speech  to beg your pardons  if you look
for a good speech now  you undo me  for what i have
to say is of mine own making  and what indeed i
should say will  i doubt  prove mine own marring 
but to the purpose  and so to the venture  be it
known to you  as it is very well  i was lately here
in the end of a displeasing play  to pray your
patience for it and to promise you a better  i
meant indeed to pay you with this  which  if like an
ill venture it come unluckily home  i break  and
you  my gentle creditors  lose  here i promised you
i would be and here i commit my body to your
mercies  bate me some and i will pay you some and 
as most debtors do  promise you infinitely 
if my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me  will
you command me to use my legs  and yet that were but
light payment  to dance out of your debt  but a
good conscience will make any possible satisfaction 
and so would i  all the gentlewomen here have
forgiven me  if the gentlemen will not  then the
gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen  which
was never seen before in such an assembly 
one word more  i beseech you  if you be not too
much cloyed with fat meat  our humble author will
continue the story  with sir john in it  and make
you merry with fair katharine of france  where  for
any thing i know  falstaff shall die of a sweat 
unless already a  be killed with your hard
opinions  for oldcastle died a martyr  and this is
not the man  my tongue is weary  when my legs are
too  i will bid you good night  and so kneel down
before you  but  indeed  to pray for the queen
