i long with all my heart to see the prince

grandam  one night  as we did sit at supper 
my uncle rivers talk how i did grow
more than my brother   ay  quoth my uncle
gloucester 
 herbs have grace  great weeds do grow apace 
and since  methinks  i would not grow so fast 
because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste 


duchess of york

good faith  good faith  the saying did not hold
in him that did object the same to thee 
he was the wretched thing when he was young 
so long a growing and so leisurely 
that  if this rule were true  he should be gracious 


archbishop of york

why  madam  so  no doubt  he is 


duchess of york

i hope he is  but yet let mothers doubt 


york

now  by my troth  if i had been remember d 
i could have given my uncle grace a flout 
to touch his growth nearer than he touch mine 


duchess of york

how  my pretty york  i pray thee  let me hear it 


york

marry  they say my uncle grew so fast
that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
 full two years ere i could get a tooth 
grandam  this would have been a biting jest 


duchess of york

i pray thee  pretty york  who told thee this 


york

grandam  his nurse 


duchess of york

his nurse  why  she was dead ere thou wert born 


york

if  not she  i cannot tell who told me 


queen elizabeth

a parlous boy  go to  you are too shrewd 


archbishop of york

queen elizabeth

pitchers have ears

the sum of all i can  i have disclosed 
why or for what these nobles were committed
is all unknown to me  my gracious lady 


queen elizabeth

ay me  i see the downfall of our house 
the tiger now hath seized the gentle hind 
insulting tyranny begins to jet
upon the innocent and aweless throne 
welcome  destruction  death  and massacre 
i see  as in a map  the end of all 


duchess of york

accursed and unquiet wrangling days 
how many of you have mine eyes beheld 
my husband lost his life to get the crown 
and often up and down my sons were toss d 
for me to joy and weep their gain and loss 
and being seated  and domestic broils
clean over blown  themselves  the conquerors 
make war upon themselves  blood against blood 
self against self  o  preposterous
and frantic outrage  end thy damned spleen 
or let me die  to look on death no more 


queen elizabeth

come  come  my boy  we will to sanctuary 
madam  farewell 


duchess of york

                  i go along with you 


queen elizabeth

you have no cause 


archbishop of york

                  my gracious lady  go 
and thither bear your treasure and your goods 
for my part  i resign unto your grace
the seal i keep  and so betide to me
as well i tender you and all of yours 
come  i conduct you to the sanctuary
