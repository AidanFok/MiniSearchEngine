scene ii  before lord hastings  house 


enter a messenger


messenger

what  ho  my lord 


hastings

 within   who knocks at the door 


messenger

a messenger from the lord stanley 
enter hastings


hastings

what is o clock 


messenger

upon the stroke of four 


hastings

cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights 


messenger

so it should seem by that i have to say 
first  he commends him to your noble lordship 


hastings

and then 


messenger

and then he sends you word
he dreamt to night the boar had razed his helm 
besides  he says there are two councils held 
and that may be determined at the one
which may make you and him to rue at the other 
therefore he sends to know your lordship pleasure 
if presently you will take horse with him 
and with all speed post with him toward the north 
to shun the danger that his soul divines 


hastings

go  fellow  go  return unto thy lord 
bid him not fear the separated councils
his honour and myself are at the one 
and at the other is my servant catesby
where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
whereof i shall not have intelligence 
tell him his fears are shallow  wanting instance 
and for his dreams  i wonder he is so fond
to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
to fly the boar before the boar pursues 
were to incense the boar to follow us
and make pursuit where he did mean no chase 
go  bid thy master rise and come to me
and we will both together to the tower 
where  he shall see  the boar will use us kindly 


messenger

my gracious lord  i tell him what you say 
exit
enter catesby


catesby

many good morrows to my noble lord 


hastings

good morrow  catesby  you are early stirring
what news  what news  in this our tottering state 


catesby

it is a reeling world  indeed  my lord 
and i believe twill never stand upright
till richard wear the garland of the realm 


hastings

how  wear the garland  dost thou mean the crown 


catesby

ay  my good lord 


hastings

i have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
ere i will see the crown so foul misplaced 
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it 


catesby

ay  on my life  and hopes to find forward
upon his party for the gain thereof 
and thereupon he sends you this good news 
that this same very day your enemies 
the kindred of the queen  must die at pomfret 


hastings

indeed  i am no mourner for that news 
because they have been still mine enemies 
but  that i give my voice on richard side 
to bar my master heirs in true descent 
god knows i will not do it  to the death 


catesby

god keep your lordship in that gracious mind 


hastings

but i shall laugh at this a twelve month hence 
that they who brought me in my master hate
i live to look upon their tragedy 
i tell thee  catesby 


catesby

what  my lord 


hastings

ere a fortnight make me elder 
i send some packing that yet think not on it 


catesby

 a vile thing to die  my gracious lord 
when men are unprepared and look not for it 


hastings

o monstrous  monstrous  and so falls it out
with rivers  vaughan  grey  and so  do
with some men else  who think themselves as safe
as thou and i  who  as thou know st  are dear
to princely richard and to buckingham 


catesby

the princes both make high account of you 
aside
for they account his head upon the bridge 


hastings

i know they do  and i have well deserved it 
enter stanley
come on  come on  where is your boar spear  man 
fear you the boar  and go so unprovided 


stanley

my lord  good morrow  good morrow  catesby 
you may jest on  but  by the holy rood 
i do not like these several councils  i 


hastings

my lord 
i hold my life as dear as you do yours 
and never in my life  i do protest 
was it more precious to me than  now 
think you  but that i know our state secure 
i would be so triumphant as i am 


stanley

the lords at pomfret  when they rode from london 
were jocund  and supposed their state was sure 
and they indeed had no cause to mistrust 
but yet  you see how soon the day o ercast 
this sudden stag of rancour i misdoubt 
pray god  i say  i prove a needless coward 
what  shall we toward the tower  the day is spent 


hastings

come  come  have with you  wot you what  my lord 
to day the lords you talk of are beheaded 


lord stanley

they  for their truth  might better wear their heads
than some that have accused them wear their hats 
but come  my lord  let us away 
enter a pursuivant


hastings

go on before  i talk with this good fellow 
exeunt stanley and catesby
how now  sirrah  how goes the world with thee 


pursuivant

the better that your lordship please to ask 


hastings

i tell thee  man   better with me now
than when i met thee last where now we meet 
then was i going prisoner to the tower 
by the suggestion of the queen allies 
but now  i tell thee keep it to thyself 
this day those enemies are put to death 
and i in better state than e i was 


pursuivant

god hold it  to your honour good content 


hastings

gramercy  fellow  there  drink that for me 
throws him his purse


pursuivant

god save your lordship 
exit
enter a priest

hastings

he whispers in his ear
enter buckingham


buckingham

what  talking with a priest  lord chamberlain 
your friends at pomfret  they do need the priest 
your honour hath no shriving work in hand 


hastings

good faith  and when i met this holy man 
those men you talk of came into my mind 
what  go you toward the tower 


buckingham

i do  my lord  but long i shall not stay
i shall return before your lordship thence 


hastings

 like enough  for i stay dinner there 


buckingham

 aside   and supper too  although thou know it not 
come  will you go 


hastings

i wait upon your lordship
