scene iv  the tower of london 


enter buckingham  derby  hastings  the bishop of  ely  ratcliff  lovel  with others  and take their seats at a table


hastings

my lords  at once  the cause why we are met
is  to determine of the coronation 
in god name  speak  when is the royal day 


buckingham

are all things fitting for that royal time 


derby

it is  and wants but nomination 


bishop of ely

to morrow  then  i judge a happy day 


buckingham

who knows the lord protector mind herein 
who is most inward with the royal duke 


bishop of ely

your grace  we think  should soonest know his mind 


buckingham

who  i  my lord i we know each other faces 
but for our hearts  he knows no more of mine 
than i of yours 
nor i no more of his  than you of mine 
lord hastings  you and he are near in love 


hastings

i thank his grace  i know he loves me well 
but  for his purpose in the coronation 
i have not sounded him  nor he deliver 
his gracious pleasure any way therein 
but you  my noble lords  may name the time 
and in the duke behalf i give my voice 
which  i presume  he take in gentle part 
enter gloucester


bishop of ely

now in good time  here comes the duke himself 


gloucester

my noble lords and cousins all  good morrow 
i have been long a sleeper  but  i hope 
my absence doth neglect no great designs 
which by my presence might have been concluded 


buckingham

had not you come upon your cue  my lord
william lord hastings had pronounced your part 
i mean  your voice for crowning of the king 


gloucester

than my lord hastings no man might be bolder 
his lordship knows me well  and loves me well 


hastings

i thank your grace 


gloucester

my lord of ely 


bishop of ely

my lord 


gloucester

when i was last in holborn 
i saw good strawberries in your garden there
i do beseech you send for some of them 


bishop of ely

marry  and will  my lord  with all my heart 
exit


gloucester

cousin of buckingham  a word with you 
drawing him aside
catesby hath sounded hastings in our business 
and finds the testy gentleman so hot 
as he will lose his head ere give consent
his master son  as worshipful as he terms it 
shall lose the royalty of england throne 


buckingham

withdraw you hence  my lord  i follow you 
exit gloucester  buckingham following


derby

we have not yet set down this day of triumph 
to morrow  in mine opinion  is too sudden 
for i myself am not so well provided
as else i would be  were the day prolong d 
re enter bishop of ely


bishop of ely

where is my lord protector  i have sent for these
strawberries 


hastings

his grace looks cheerfully and smooth to day 
there some conceit or other likes him well 
when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit 
i think there never a man in christendom
that can less hide his love or hate than he 
for by his face straight shall you know his heart 


derby

what of his heart perceive you in his face
by any likelihood he show to day 


hastings

marry  that with no man here he is offended 
for  were he  he had shown it in his looks 


derby

i pray god he be not  i say 
re enter gloucester and buckingham


gloucester

i pray you all  tell me what they deserve
that do conspire my death with devilish plots
of damned witchcraft  and that have prevail 
upon my body with their hellish charms 


hastings

the tender love i bear your grace  my lord 
makes me most forward in this noble presence
to doom the offenders  whatsoever they be
i say  my lord  they have deserved death 


gloucester

then be your eyes the witness of this ill 
see how i am bewitch d  behold mine arm
is  like a blasted sapling  wither up 
and this is edward wife  that monstrous witch 
consorted with that harlot strumpet shore 
that by their witchcraft thus have marked me 


hastings

if they have done this thing  my gracious lord 


gloucester

if i thou protector of this damned strumpet 
tellest thou me of  ifs   thou art a traitor 
off with his head  now  by saint paul i swear 
i will not dine until i see the same 
lovel and ratcliff  look that it be done 
the rest  that love me  rise and follow me 
exeunt all but hastings  ratcliff  and lovel


hastings

woe  woe for england  not a whit for me 
for i  too fond  might have prevented this 
stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm 
but i disdain it  and did scorn to fly 
three times to day my foot cloth horse did stumble 
and startled  when he look upon the tower 
as loath to bear me to the slaughter house 
o  now i want the priest that spake to me 
i now repent i told the pursuivant
as  triumphing at mine enemies 
how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher d 
and i myself secure in grace and favour 
o margaret  margaret  now thy heavy curse
is lighted on poor hastings  wretched head 


ratcliff

dispatch  my lord  the duke would be at dinner 
make a short shrift  he longs to see your head 


hastings

o momentary grace of mortal men 
which we more hunt for than the grace of god 
who builds his hopes in air of your good looks 
lives like a drunken sailor on a mast 
ready  with every nod  to tumble down
into the fatal bowels of the deep 


lovel

come  come  dispatch   bootless to exclaim 


hastings

o bloody richard  miserable england 
i prophesy the fearful time to thee
that ever wretched age hath look upon 
come  lead me to the block  bear him my head 
they smile at me that shortly shall be dead 
exeunt
