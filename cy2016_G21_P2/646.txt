scrivener

this is the indictment of the good lord hastings 
which in a set hand fairly is engross d 
that it may be this day read over in paul s 
and mark how well the sequel hangs together 
eleven hours i spent to write it over 
for yesternight by catesby was it brought me 
the precedent was full as long a doing 
and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings 
untainted  unexamined  free  at liberty
here a good world the while  why who so gross 
that seeth not this palpable device 
yet who so blind  but says he sees it not 
bad is the world  and all will come to nought 
when such bad dealings must be seen in thought
