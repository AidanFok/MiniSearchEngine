queen elizabeth

o dorset  speak not to me  get thee hence 
death and destruction dog thee at the heels 
thy mother name is ominous to children 
if thou wilt outstrip death  go cross the seas 
and live with richmond  from the reach of hell
go  hie thee  hie thee from this slaughter house 
lest thou increase the number of the dead 
and make me die the thrall of margaret curse 
nor mother  wife  nor england counted queen

o ill dispersing wind of misery 
o my accursed womb  the bed of death

whose unavoided eye is murderous 


lord stanley

come  madam  come  i in all haste was sent 


lady anne

and i in all unwillingness will go 
i would to god that the inclusive verge
of golden metal that must round my brow
were red hot steel  to sear me to the brain 
anointed let me be with deadly venom 
and die  ere men can say  god save the queen 


queen elizabeth

go  go  poor soul  i envy not thy glory
to feed my humour  wish thyself no harm 


lady anne

no  why   when he that is my husband now
came to me  as i follow henry corse 
when scarce the blood was well wash from his hands
which issued from my other angel husband
and that dead saint which then i weeping follow d 
o  when  i say  i look on richard face 
this was my wish   thou  quoth i    accursed 
for making me  so young  so old a widow 
and  when thou wed st  let sorrow haunt thy bed 
and be thy wife if any be so mad 
as miserable by the life of thee
as thou hast made me by my dear lord death 
lo  ere i can repeat this curse again 
even in so short a space  my woman heart
grossly grew captive to his honey words
and proved the subject of my own soul curse 
which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest 
for never yet one hour in his bed
have i enjoy the golden dew of sleep 
but have been waked by his timorous dreams 
besides  he hates me for my father warwick 
and will  no doubt  shortly be rid of me 


queen elizabeth

poor heart  adieu  i pity thy complaining 


lady anne

no more than from my soul i mourn for yours 


queen elizabeth

farewell  thou woful welcomer of glory 


lady anne

adieu  poor soul  that takest thy leave of it 


duchess of york

 to dorset 
go thou to richmond  and good fortune guide thee 
to lady anne
go thou to richard  and good angels guard thee 
to queen elizabeth
go thou to sanctuary  and good thoughts possess thee 
i to my grave  where peace and rest lie with me 
eighty odd years of sorrow have i seen 
and each hour joy wrecked with a week of teen 


queen elizabeth

stay  yet look back with me unto the tower 
pity  you ancient stones  those tender babes
whom envy hath immured within your walls 
rough cradle for such little pretty ones 
rude ragged nurse  old sullen playfellow
for tender princes  use my babies well 
so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell
