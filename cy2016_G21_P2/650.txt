tyrrel

the tyrannous and bloody deed is done 
the most arch of piteous massacre
that ever yet this land was guilty of 
dighton and forrest  whom i did suborn
to do this ruthless piece of butchery 
although they were flesh villains  bloody dogs 
melting with tenderness and kind compassion
wept like two children in their deaths  sad stories 
 lo  thus  quoth dighton   those tender babes 
 thus  thus  quoth forrest   one another
within their innocent alabaster arms 
their lips were four red roses on a stalk 
which in their summer beauty kiss each other 
a book of prayers on their pillow lay 
which once  quoth forrest   changed my mind 
but o  the devil there the villain stopp 
whilst dighton thus told on   smothered
the most replenished sweet work of nature 
that from the prime creation e she framed 
thus both are gone with conscience and remorse 
they could not speak  and so i left them both 
to bring this tidings to the bloody king 
and here he comes 
enter king richard iii
all hail  my sovereign liege 


king richard iii

kind tyrrel  am i happy in thy news 


tyrrel

if to have done the thing you gave in charge
beget your happiness  be happy then 
for it is done  my lord 


king richard iii

but didst thou see them dead 


tyrrel

i did  my lord 


king richard iii

                 and buried  gentle tyrrel 


tyrrel

the chaplain of the tower hath buried them 
but how or in what place i do not know 


king richard iii

come to me  tyrrel  soon at after supper 
and thou shalt tell the process of their death 
meantime  but think how i may do thee good 
and be inheritor of thy desire 
farewell till soon 
exit tyrrel
the son of clarence have i pent up close 
his daughter meanly have i match in marriage 
the sons of edward sleep in abraham bosom 
and anne my wife hath bid the world good night 
now  for i know the breton richmond aims
at young elizabeth  my brother daughter 
and  by that knot  looks proudly o the crown 
to her i go  a jolly thriving wooer 
enter catesby


catesby

my lord 


king richard iii

good news or bad  that thou comest in so bluntly 


catesby

bad news  my lord  ely is fled to richmond 
and buckingham  back with the hardy welshmen 
is in the field  and still his power increaseth 


king richard iii

ely with richmond troubles me more near
than buckingham and his rash levied army 
come  i have heard that fearful commenting
is leaden servitor to dull delay 
delay leads impotent and snail paced beggary
then fiery expedition be my wing 
jove mercury  and herald for a king 
come  muster men  my counsel is my shield 
we must be brief when traitors brave the field 
exeunt
