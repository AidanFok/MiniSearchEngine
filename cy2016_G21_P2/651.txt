as thou canst yield a melancholy seat 
then would i hide my bones  not rest them here 
o  who hath any cause to mourn but i 
sitting down by her


queen margaret

if ancient sorrow be most reverend 
give mine the benefit of seniory 
and let my woes frown on the upper hand 
if sorrow can admit society 
sitting down with them
tell o your woes again by viewing mine 
i had an edward  till a richard kill him 
i had a harry  till a richard kill him 
thou hadst an edward  till a richard kill him 
thou hadst a richard  till a richard killed him 


duchess of york

i had a richard too  and thou didst kill him 
i had a rutland too  thou holp to kill him 


queen margaret

thou hadst a clarence too  and richard kill him 
from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
a hell hound that doth hunt us all to death 
that dog  that had his teeth before his eyes 
to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood 
that foul defacer of god handiwork 
that excellent grand tyrant of the earth 
that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls 
thy womb let loose  to chase us to our graves 
o upright  just  and true disposing god 
how do i thank thee  that this carnal cur
preys on the issue of his mother body 
and makes her pew fellow with others  moan 


duchess of york

o harry wife  triumph not in my woes

queen margaret

bear with me  i am hungry for revenge 
and now i cloy me with beholding it 
thy edward he is dead  that stabb my edward

young york he is but boot  because both they
match not the high perfection of my loss 
thy clarence he is dead that kill my edward 
and the beholders of this tragic play 
the adulterate hastings  rivers  vaughan  grey 
untimely smother in their dusky graves 
richard yet lives  hell black intelligencer 
only reserved their factor  to buy souls
and send them thither  but at hand  at hand 
ensues his piteous and unpitied end 
earth gapes  hell burns  fiends roar  saints pray 
to have him suddenly convey away 
cancel his bond of life  dear god  i prey 
that i may live to say  the dog is dead 


queen elizabeth

o  thou didst prophesy the time would come
that i should wish for thee to help me curse
that bottled spider  that foul bunch back toad 


queen margaret

i call thee then vain flourish of my fortune 
i call thee then poor shadow  painted queen 
the presentation of but what i was 
the flattering index of a direful pageant 
one heaved a high  to be hurl down below 
a mother only mock with two sweet babes 
a dream of what thou wert  a breath  a bubble 
a sign of dignity  a garish flag 
to be the aim of every dangerous shot 
a queen in jest  only to fill the scene 
where is thy husband now  where be thy brothers 
where are thy children  wherein dost thou  joy 
who sues to thee and cries  save the queen 
where be the bending peers that flatter thee 
where be the thronging troops that follow thee 
decline all this  and see what now thou art 
for happy wife  a most distressed widow 
for joyful mother  one that wails the name 
for queen  a very caitiff crown with care 
for one being sued to  one that humbly sues 
for one that scorn at me  now scorn of me 
for one being fear of all  now fearing one 
for one commanding all  obey of none 
thus hath the course of justice wheel about 
and left thee but a very prey to time 
having no more but thought of what thou wert 
to torture thee the more  being what thou art 
thou didst usurp my place  and dost thou not
usurp the just proportion of my sorrow 
now thy proud neck bears half my burthen yoke 
from which even here i slip my weary neck 
and leave the burthen of it all on thee 
farewell  york wife  and queen of sad mischance 
these english woes will make me smile in france 


queen elizabeth

o thou well skill in curses  stay awhile 
and teach me how to curse mine enemies 


queen margaret

forbear to sleep the nights  and fast the days 
compare dead happiness with living woe 
think that thy babes were fairer than they were 
and he that slew them fouler than he is 
bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse 
revolving this will teach thee how to curse 


queen elizabeth

my words are dull  o  quicken them with thine 


queen margaret

thy woes will make them sharp  and pierce like mine 
exit


duchess of york

why should calamity be full of words 


queen elizabeth

windy attorneys to their client woes 
airy succeeders of intestate joys 
poor breathing orators of miseries 
let them have scope  though what they do impart
help not all  yet do they ease the heart 


duchess of york

if so  then be not tongue tied  go with me 
and in the breath of bitter words let smother
my damned son  which thy two sweet sons smother d 
i hear his drum  be copious in exclaims 
enter king richard iii  marching  with drums and trumpets


king richard iii

who intercepts my expedition 


duchess of york

o  she that might have intercepted thee 
by strangling thee in her accursed womb
from all the slaughters  wretch  that thou hast done 


queen elizabeth

hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown 
where should be graven  if that right were right 
the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown 
and the dire death of my two sons and brothers 
tell me  thou villain slave  where are my children 


duchess of york

thou toad  thou toad  where is thy brother clarence 
and little ned plantagenet  his son 


queen elizabeth

where is kind hastings  rivers  vaughan  grey 


king richard iii

a flourish  trumpets  strike alarum  drums 
let not the heavens hear these tell tale women
rail on the lord enointed  strike  i say 
flourish  alarums
either be patient  and entreat me fair 
or with the clamorous report of war
thus will i drown your exclamations 


duchess of york

art thou my son 


king richard iii

ay  i thank god  my father  and yourself 


duchess of york

then patiently hear my impatience 


king richard iii

madam  i have a touch of your condition 
which cannot brook the accent of reproof 


duchess of york

o  let me speak 


king richard iii

                  do then  but i not hear 


duchess of york

i will be mild and gentle in my speech 


king richard iii

and brief  good mother  for i am in haste 


duchess of york

art thou so hasty  i have stay for thee 
god knows  in anguish  pain and agony 


king richard iii

and came i not at last to comfort you 


duchess of york

no  by the holy rood  thou know it well 
thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell 
a grievous burthen was thy birth to me 
tetchy and wayward was thy infancy 
thy school days frightful  desperate  wild  and furious 
thy prime of manhood daring  bold  and venturous 
thy age confirm d  proud  subdued  bloody 
treacherous 
more mild  but yet more harmful  kind in hatred 
what comfortable hour canst thou name 
that ever graced me in thy company 


king richard iii

faith  none  but humphrey hour  that call 
your grace
to breakfast once forth of my company 
if i be so disgracious in your sight 
let me march on  and not offend your grace 
strike the drum 


duchess of york

                  i prithee  hear me speak 


king richard iii

you speak too bitterly 


duchess of york

hear me a word 
for i shall never speak to thee again 


king richard iii

so 


duchess of york

either thou wilt die  by god just ordinance 
ere from this war thou turn a conqueror 
or i with grief and extreme age shall perish
and never look upon thy face again 
therefore take with thee my most heavy curse 
which  in the day of battle  tire thee more
than all the complete armour that thou wear st 
my prayers on the adverse party fight 
and there the little souls of edward children
whisper the spirits of thine enemies
and promise them success and victory 
bloody thou art  bloody will be thy end 
shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend 
exit


queen elizabeth

though far more cause  yet much less spirit to curse
abides in me  i say amen to all 


king richard iii

stay  madam  i must speak a word with you 


queen elizabeth

i have no more sons of the royal blood
for thee to murder  for my daughters  richard 
they shall be praying nuns  not weeping queens 
and therefore level not to hit their lives 


king richard iii

you have a daughter call elizabeth 
virtuous and fair  royal and gracious 


queen elizabeth

and must she die for this  o  let her live 
and i corrupt her manners  stain her beauty 
slander myself as false to edward bed 
throw over her the veil of infamy 
so she may live unscarr of bleeding slaughter 
i will confess she was not edward daughter 


king richard iii

wrong not her birth  she is of royal blood 


queen elizabeth

to save her life  i say she is not so 


king richard iii

her life is only safest in her birth 


queen elizabeth

and only in that safety died her brothers 


king richard iii

lo  at their births good stars were opposite 


queen elizabeth

no  to their lives bad friends were contrary 


king richard iii

all unavoided is the doom of destiny 


queen elizabeth

true  when avoided grace makes destiny 
my babes were destined to a fairer death 
if grace had bless thee with a fairer life 


king richard iii

you speak as if that i had slain my cousins 


queen elizabeth

cousins  indeed  and by their uncle cozen 
of comfort  kingdom  kindred  freedom  life 
whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts 
thy head  all indirectly  gave direction 
no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
till it was whetted on thy stone hard heart 
to revel in the entrails of my lambs 
but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame 
my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
till that my nails were anchor in thine eyes 
and i  in such a desperate bay of death 
like a poor bark  of sails and tackling reft 
rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom 


king richard iii

madam  so thrive i in my enterprise
and dangerous success of bloody wars 
as i intend more good to you and yours 
than ever you or yours were by me wrong d 


queen elizabeth

what good is cover with the face of heaven 
to be discover d  that can do me good 


king richard iii

the advancement of your children  gentle lady 


queen elizabeth

up to some scaffold  there to lose their heads 


king richard iii

no  to the dignity and height of honour
the high imperial type of this earth glory 


queen elizabeth

flatter my sorrows with report of it 
tell me what state  what dignity  what honour 
canst thou demise to any child of mine 


king richard iii

even all i have  yea  and myself and all 
will i withal endow a child of thine 
so in the lethe of thy angry soul
thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
which thou supposest i have done to thee 


queen elizabeth

be brief  lest that be process of thy kindness
last longer telling than thy kindness  date 


king richard iii

then know  that from my soul i love thy daughter 


queen elizabeth

my daughter mother thinks it with her soul 


king richard iii

what do you think 


queen elizabeth

that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul 
so from thy soul love didst thou love her brothers 
and from my heart love i do thank thee for it 


king richard iii

be not so hasty to confound my meaning 
i mean  that with my soul i love thy daughter 
and mean to make her queen of england 


queen elizabeth

say then  who dost thou mean shall be her king 


king richard iii

even he that makes her queen who should be else 


queen elizabeth

what  thou 


king richard iii

i  even i  what think you of it  madam 


queen elizabeth

how canst thou woo her 


king richard iii

that would i learn of you 
as one that are best acquainted with her humour 


queen elizabeth

and wilt thou learn of me 


king richard iii

madam  with all my heart 


queen elizabeth

send to her  by the man that slew her brothers 
a pair of bleeding hearts  thereon engrave
edward and york  then haply she will weep 
therefore present to her as sometime margaret
did to thy father  steep in rutland blood 
a handkerchief  which  say to her  did drain
the purple sap from her sweet brother body
and bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith 
if this inducement force her not to love 
send her a story of thy noble acts 
tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence 
her uncle rivers  yea  and  for her sake 
madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne 


king richard iii

come  come  you mock me  this is not the way
to win our daughter 


queen elizabeth

there is no other way
unless thou couldst put on some other shape 
and not be richard that hath done all this 


king richard iii

say that i did all this for love of her 


queen elizabeth

nay  then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee 
having bought love with such a bloody spoil 


king richard iii

look  what is done cannot be now amended 
men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes 
which after hours give leisure to repent 
if i did take the kingdom from your sons 
to make amends  ill give it to your daughter 
if i have kill the issue of your womb 
to quicken your increase  i will beget
mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
a grandam name is little less in love
than is the doting title of a mother 
they are as children but one step below 
even of your mettle  of your very blood 
of an one pain  save for a night of groans
endured of her  for whom you bid like sorrow 
your children were vexation to your youth 
but mine shall be a comfort to your age 
the loss you have is but a son being king 
and by that loss your daughter is made queen 
i cannot make you what amends i would 
therefore accept such kindness as i can 
dorset your son  that with a fearful soul
leads discontented steps in foreign soil 
this fair alliance quickly shall call home
to high promotions and great dignity 
the king  that calls your beauteous daughter wife 
familiarly shall call thy dorset brother 
again shall you be mother to a king 
and all the ruins of distressful times
repair with double riches of content 
what  we have many goodly days to see 
the liquid drops of tears that you have shed
shall come again  transform to orient pearl 
advantaging their loan with interest
of ten times double gain of happiness 
go  then my mother  to thy daughter go
make bold her bashful years with your experience 
prepare her ears to hear a wooer tale
put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
of golden sovereignty  acquaint the princess
with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
and when this arm of mine hath chastised
the petty rebel  dull brain buckingham 
bound with triumphant garlands will i come
and lead thy daughter to a conqueror bed 
to whom i will retail my conquest won 
and she shall be sole victress  caesar caesar 


queen elizabeth

what were i best to say  her father brother
would be her lord  or shall i say  her uncle 
or  he that slew her brothers and her uncles 
under what title shall i woo for thee 
that god  the law  my honour and her love 
can make seem pleasing to her tender years 


king richard iii

infer fair england peace by this alliance 


queen elizabeth

which she shall purchase with still lasting war 


king richard iii

say that the king  which may command  entreats 


queen elizabeth

that at her hands which the king king forbids 


king richard iii

say  she shall be a high and mighty queen 


queen elizabeth

to wail the tide  as her mother doth 


king richard iii

say  i will love her everlastingly 


queen elizabeth

but how long shall that title  ever  last 


king richard iii

sweetly in force unto her fair life end 


queen elizabeth

but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last 


king richard iii

so long as heaven and nature lengthens it 


queen elizabeth

so long as hell and richard likes of it 


king richard iii

say  i  her sovereign  am her subject love 


queen elizabeth

but she  your subject  loathes such sovereignty 


king richard iii

be eloquent in my behalf to her 


queen elizabeth

an honest tale speeds best being plainly told 


king richard iii

then in plain terms tell her my loving tale 


queen elizabeth

plain and not honest is too harsh a style 


king richard iii

your reasons are too shallow and too quick 


queen elizabeth

o no  my reasons are too deep and dead 
too deep and dead  poor infants  in their grave 


king richard iii

harp not on that string  madam  that is past 


queen elizabeth

harp on it still shall i till heart strings break 


king richard iii

now  by my george  my garter  and my crown 


queen elizabeth

profaned  dishonour d  and the third usurp d 


king richard iii

i swear 


queen elizabeth

if something thou wilt swear to be believed 
swear then by something that thou hast not wrong d

king richard iii

then  by myself 


queen elizabeth

                  thyself thyself misusest 


king richard iii

why then  by god 


queen elizabeth

                  god wrong is most of all 
if thou hadst fear to break an oath by him 
the unity the king thy brother made
had not been broken  nor my brother slain 
if thou hadst fear to break an oath by him 
the imperial metal  circling now thy brow 
had graced the tender temples of my child 
and both the princes had been breathing here 
which now  two tender playfellows to dust 
thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms 
what canst thou swear by now 


king richard iii

the time to come 


queen elizabeth

that thou hast wronged in the time o erpast 
for i myself have many tears to wash
hereafter time  for time past wrong by thee 
the children live  whose parents thou hast
slaughter d 
ungovern youth  to wail it in their age 
the parents live  whose children thou hast butcher d 
old wither plants  to wail it with their age 
swear not by time to come  for that thou hast
misused ere used  by time misused o erpast 


king richard iii

so thrive i in my dangerous attempt
of hostile arms  myself myself confound 
heaven and fortune bar me happy hours 
day  yield me not thy light  nor  night  thy rest

to my proceedings  if  with pure heart love 
immaculate devotion  holy thoughts 
i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter 
in her consists my happiness and thine 
without her  follows to this land and me 
to thee  herself  and many a christian soul 
death  desolation  ruin and decay 
it cannot be avoided but by this 
it will not be avoided but by this 
therefore  good mother i must can you so 
be the attorney of my love to her 
plead what i will be  not what i have been 
not my deserts  but what i will deserve 
urge the necessity and state of times 
and be not peevish fond in great designs 


queen elizabeth
