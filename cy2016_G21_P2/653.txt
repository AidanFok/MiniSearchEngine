scene i  salisbury  an open place 


enter the sheriff  and buckingham  with halberds  led to execution


buckingham

will not king richard let me speak with him 


sheriff

no  my good lord  therefore be patient 


buckingham

hastings  and edward children  rivers  grey 
holy king henry  and thy fair son edward 
vaughan  and all that have miscarried
by underhand corrupted foul injustice 
if that your moody discontented souls
do through the clouds behold this present hour 
even for revenge mock my destruction 
this is all souls  day  fellows  is it not 


sheriff

it is  my lord 


buckingham

why  then all souls  day is my body doomsday 
this is the day that  in king edward time 
i wish might fall on me  when i was found
false to his children or his wife allies
this is the day wherein i wish to fall
by the false faith of him i trusted most 
this  this all souls  day to my fearful soul
is the determined respite of my wrongs 
that high all seer that i dallied with
hath turn my feigned prayer on my head
and given in earnest what i begg in jest 
thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
to turn their own points on their masters  bosoms 
now margaret curse is fallen upon my head 
 he  quoth she   split thy heart with sorrow 
remember margaret was a prophetess 
come  sirs  convey me to the block of shame 
wrong hath but wrong  and blame the due of blame 
exeunt
