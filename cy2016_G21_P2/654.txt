scene ii  the camp near tamworth 


enter richmond  oxford  blunt  herbert  and others  with drum and colours


richmond

fellows in arms  and my most loving friends 
bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny 
thus far into the bowels of the land
have we march on without impediment 
and here receive we from our father stanley
lines of fair comfort and encouragement 
the wretched  bloody  and usurping boar 
that spoil your summer fields and fruitful vines 
swills your warm blood like wash  and makes his trough
in your embowell bosoms  this foul swine
lies now even in the centre of this isle 
near to the town of leicester  as we learn
from tamworth thither is but one day march 
in god name  cheerly on  courageous friends 
to reap the harvest of perpetual peace
by this one bloody trial of sharp war 


oxford

every man conscience is a thousand swords 
to fight against that bloody homicide 


herbert

i doubt not but his friends will fly to us 


blunt

he hath no friends but who are friends for fear 
which in his greatest need will shrink from him 


richmond

all for our vantage  then  in god name  march 
true hope is swift  and flies with swallow wings 
kings it makes gods  and meaner creatures kings 
exeunt
