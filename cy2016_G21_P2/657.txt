that long have frown upon their enmity 
what traitor hears me  and says not amen

the brother blindly shed the brother blood 
the father rashly slaughter his own son 
the son  compell d  been butcher to the sire 
all this divided york and lancaster 
divided in their dire division 
o  now  let richmond and elizabeth 
the true succeeders of each royal house 
by god fair ordinance conjoin together 
and let their heirs  god  if thy will be so 
enrich the time to come with smooth faced peace 
with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days 
abate the edge of traitors  gracious lord 
that would reduce these bloody days again 
and make poor england weep in streams of blood 
let them not live to taste this land increase
that would with treason wound this fair land peace 
now civil wounds are stopp d  peace lives again 
that she may long live here  god say amen 
exeunt
