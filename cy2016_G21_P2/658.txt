prologue


two households  both alike in dignity 
in fair verona  where we lay our scene 
from ancient grudge break to new mutiny 
where civil blood makes civil hands unclean 
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
a pair of star cross lovers take their life 
whose misadventured piteous overthrows
do with their death bury their parents  strife 
the fearful passage of their death mark love 
and the continuance of their parents  rage 
which  but their children end  nought could remove 
is now the two hours  traffic of our stage 
the which if you with patient ears attend 
what here shall miss  our toil shall strive to mend
