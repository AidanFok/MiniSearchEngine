rebellious subjects  enemies to peace 
profaners of this neighbour stained steel 
will they not hear  what  ho  you men  you beasts 
that quench the fire of your pernicious rage
with purple fountains issuing from your veins 
on pain of torture  from those bloody hands
throw your mistemper weapons to the ground 
and hear the sentence of your moved prince 
three civil brawls  bred of an airy word 
by thee  old capulet  and montague 
have thrice disturb the quiet of our streets 
and made verona ancient citizens
cast by their grave beseeming ornaments 
to wield old partisans  in hands as old 
canker with peace  to part your canker hate 
if ever you disturb our streets again 
your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace 
for this time  all the rest depart away 
you capulet  shall go along with me 
and  montague  come you this afternoon 
to know our further pleasure in this case 
to old free town  our common judgment place 
once more  on pain of death  all men depart 
exeunt all but montague  lady montague  and benvolio


montague

who set this ancient quarrel new abroach 
speak  nephew  were you by when it began 


benvolio

here were the servants of your adversary 
and yours  close fighting ere i did approach 
i drew to part them  in the instant came
the fiery tybalt  with his sword prepared 
which  as he breathed defiance to my ears 
he swung about his head and cut the winds 
who nothing hurt withal hiss him in scorn 
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows 
came more and more and fought on part and part 
till the prince came  who parted either part 


lady montague

o  where is romeo  saw you him to day 
right glad i am he was not at this fray 


benvolio

madam  an hour before the worshipp sun
peer forth the golden window of the east 
a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad 
where  underneath the grove of sycamore
that westward rooteth from the city side 
so early walking did i see your son 
towards him i made  but he was ware of me
and stole into the covert of the wood 
i  measuring his affections by my own 
that most are busied when they most alone 
pursued my humour not pursuing his 
and gladly shunn who gladly fled from me 


montague

many a morning hath he there been seen 
with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew 
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs 
but all so soon as the all cheering sun
should in the furthest east begin to draw
the shady curtains from aurora bed 
away from the light steals home my heavy son 
and private in his chamber pens himself 
shuts up his windows  locks far daylight out
and makes himself an artificial night 
black and portentous must this humour prove 
unless good counsel may the cause remove 


benvolio

my noble uncle  do you know the cause 


montague

i neither know it nor can learn of him 


benvolio

have you importuned him by any means 


montague

both by myself and many other friends 
but he  his own affections  counsellor 
is to himself i will not say how true 
but to himself so secret and so close 
so far from sounding and discovery 
as is the bud bit with an envious worm 
ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air 
or dedicate his beauty to the sun 
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow 
we would as willingly give cure as know 
enter romeo


benvolio

see  where he comes  so please you  step aside 
i know his grievance  or be much denied 


montague

i would thou wert so happy by thy stay 
to hear true shrift  come  madam  let away 
exeunt montague and lady montague


benvolio

good morrow  cousin 


romeo

is the day so young 


benvolio

but new struck nine 


romeo

ay me  sad hours seem long 
was that my father that went hence so fast 


benvolio

it was  what sadness lengthens romeo hours 


romeo

not having that  which  having  makes them short 


benvolio

in love 


romeo

out 


benvolio

of love 


romeo

out of her favour  where i am in love 


benvolio

alas  that love  so gentle in his view 
should be so tyrannous and rough in proof 


romeo

alas  that love  whose view is muffled still 
should  without eyes  see pathways to his will 
where shall we dine  o me  what fray was here 
yet tell me not  for i have heard it all 
here much to do with hate  but more with love 
why  then  o brawling love  o loving hate 
o any thing  of nothing first create 
o heavy lightness  serious vanity 
mis shapen chaos of well seeming forms 
feather of lead  bright smoke  cold fire 
sick health 
still waking sleep  that is not what it is 
this love feel i  that feel no love in this 
dost thou not laugh 


benvolio

no  coz  i rather weep 


romeo

good heart  at what 


benvolio

at thy good heart oppression 


romeo

why  such is love transgression 
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast 
which thou wilt propagate  to have it prest
with more of thine  this love that thou hast shown
doth add more grief to too much of mine own 
love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs 
being purged  a fire sparkling in lovers  eyes 
being vex a sea nourish with lovers  tears 
what is it else  a madness most discreet 
a choking gall and a preserving sweet 
farewell  my coz 


benvolio

                  soft  i will go along 
an if you leave me so  you do me wrong 


romeo

tut  i have lost myself  i am not here 
this is not romeo  he some other where 


benvolio

tell me in sadness  who is that you love 


romeo

what  shall i groan and tell thee 


benvolio

groan  why  no 
but sadly tell me who 


romeo

bid a sick man in sadness make his will 
ah  word ill urged to one that is so ill 
in sadness  cousin  i do love a woman 


benvolio

i aim so near  when i supposed you loved 


romeo

a right good mark man  and she fair i love 


benvolio

a right fair mark  fair coz  is soonest hit 


romeo

well  in that hit you miss  she not be hit
with cupid arrow  she hath dian wit 
and  in strong proof of chastity well arm d 
from love weak childish bow she lives unharm d 
she will not stay the siege of loving terms 
nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes 
nor ope her lap to saint seducing gold 
o  she is rich in beauty  only poor 
that when she dies with beauty dies her store 


benvolio

then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste 


romeo

she hath  and in that sparing makes huge waste 
for beauty starved with her severity
cuts beauty off from all posterity 
she is too fair  too wise  wisely too fair 
to merit bliss by making me despair 
she hath forsworn to love  and in that vow
do i live dead that live to tell it now 


benvolio

be ruled by me  forget to think of her 


romeo

o  teach me how i should forget to think 


benvolio

by giving liberty unto thine eyes 
examine other beauties 


romeo

 the way
to call hers exquisite  in question more 
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies  brows
being black put us in mind they hide the fair 
he that is strucken blind cannot forget
the precious treasure of his eyesight lost 
show me a mistress that is passing fair 
what doth her beauty serve  but as a note
where i may read who pass that passing fair 
farewell  thou canst not teach me to forget 


benvolio

i pay that doctrine  or else die in debt 
exeunt
