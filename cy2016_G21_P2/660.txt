when well apparell april on the heel
of limping winter treads  even such delight
among fresh female buds shall you this night
inherit at my house  hear all  all see 
and like her most whose merit most shall be 
which on more view  of many mine being one
may stand in number  though in reckoning none

tut  man  one fire burns out another burning 
one pain is lessen by another anguish 
turn giddy  and be holp by backward turning 
one desperate grief cures with another languish 
take thou some new infection to thy eye 
and the rank poison of the old will die 


romeo

benvolio

for what  i pray thee 


romeo

for your broken shin

benvolio

at this same ancient feast of capulet 
sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lovest 
with all the admired beauties of verona 
go thither  and  with unattainted eye 
compare her face with some that i shall show 
and i will make thee think thy swan a crow 


romeo

when the devout religion of mine eye
maintains such falsehood  then turn tears to fires 
and these  who often drown could never die 
transparent heretics  be burnt for liars 
one fairer than my love  the all seeing sun
ne saw her match since first the world begun 


benvolio

tut  you saw her fair  none else being by 
herself poised with herself in either eye 
but in that crystal scales let there be weigh 
your lady love against some other maid
that i will show you shining at this feast 
and she shall scant show well that now shows best 


romeo

i go along  no such sight to be shown 
but to rejoice in splendor of mine own
