on lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen 
that shall she  marry  i remember it well 
 since the earthquake now eleven years 
and she was wean d i never shall forget it 
of all the days of the year  upon that day 
for i had then laid wormwood to my dug 
sitting in the sun under the dove house wall 
my lord and you were then at mantua 
nay  i do bear a brain but  as i said 
when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
of my dug and felt it bitter  pretty fool 
to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug 
shake quoth the dove house   no need  i trow 
to bid me trudge 
and since that time it is eleven years 
for then she could stand alone  nay  by the rood 
she could have run and waddled all about 
for even the day before  she broke her brow 
and then my husband god be with his soul 
a  was a merry man took up the child 
 yea  quoth he   thou fall upon thy face 
thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit 
wilt thou not  jule  and  by my holidame 
the pretty wretch left crying and said  ay 
to see  now  how a jest shall come about 
i warrant  an i should live a thousand years 
i never should forget it   thou not  jule  quoth he 
and  pretty fool  it stinted and said  ay 


lady capulet

enough of this  i pray thee  hold thy peace 


nurse

yes  madam  yet i cannot choose but laugh 
to think it should leave crying and say  ay 
and yet  i warrant  it had upon its brow
a bump as big as a young cockerel stone 
a parlous knock  and it cried bitterly 
 yea  quoth my husband fall upon thy face 
thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age 
wilt thou not  jule  it stinted and said  ay 


juliet

and stint thou too  i pray thee  nurse  say i 


nurse

peace  i have done  god mark thee to his grace 
thou wast the prettiest babe that e i nursed 
an i might live to see thee married once 
i have my wish 


lady capulet

i came to talk of  tell me  daughter juliet 
how stands your disposition to be married 


juliet

it is an honour that i dream not of 


nurse

an honour  were not i thine only nurse 
i would say thou hadst suck wisdom from thy teat 


lady capulet

well  think of marriage now  younger than you 
here in verona  ladies of esteem 
are made already mothers  by my count 
i was your mother much upon these years
that you are now a maid  thus then in brief 
the valiant paris seeks you for his love

what say you  can you love the gentleman 
this night you shall behold him at our feast 
read o the volume of young paris  face 
and find delight writ there with beauty pen 
examine every married lineament 
and see how one another lends content
and what obscured in this fair volume lies
find written in the margent of his eyes 
this precious book of love  this unbound lover 
to beautify him  only lacks a cover 
the fish lives in the sea  and  much pride
for fair without the fair within to hide 
that book in many eyes doth share the glory 
that in gold clasps locks in the golden story 
so shall you share all that he doth possess 
by having him  making yourself no less 


nurse

no less  nay  bigger  women grow by men 


lady capulet

speak briefly  can you like of paris  love 


juliet

but no more deep will i endart mine eye
than your consent gives strength to make it fly 
enter a servant
