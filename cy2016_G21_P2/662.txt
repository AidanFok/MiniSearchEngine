scene iv  a street 


enter romeo  mercutio  benvolio  with five or six maskers  torch bearers  and others


romeo

what  shall this speech be spoke for our excuse 
or shall we on without a apology 


benvolio

the date is out of such prolixity 
we have no cupid hoodwink with a scarf 
bearing a tartar painted bow of lath 
scaring the ladies like a crow keeper 
nor no without book prologue  faintly spoke
after the prompter  for our entrance 
but let them measure us by what they will 
we measure them a measure  and be gone 


romeo

give me a torch  i am not for this ambling 
being but heavy  i will bear the light 


mercutio

nay  gentle romeo  we must have you dance 


romeo

not i  believe me  you have dancing shoes
with nimble soles  i have a soul of lead
so stakes me to the ground i cannot move 


mercutio

you are a lover  borrow cupid wings 
and soar with them above a common bound 


romeo

i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
to soar with his light feathers  and so bound 
i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe 
under love heavy burden do i sink 


mercutio

and  to sink in it  should you burden love 
too great oppression for a tender thing 


romeo

is love a tender thing  it is too rough 
too rude  too boisterous  and it pricks like thorn 


mercutio

if love be rough with you  be rough with love 
prick love for pricking  and you beat love down 
give me a case to put my visage in 
a visor for a visor  what care i
what curious eye doth quote deformities 
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me 


benvolio

come  knock and enter  and no sooner in 
but every man betake him to his legs 


romeo

a torch for me  let wantons light of heart
tickle the senseless rushes with their heels 
for i am proverb with a grandsire phrase 
i be a candle holder  and look on 
the game was ne so fair  and i am done 


mercutio

tut  dun the mouse  the constable own word 
if thou art dun  we draw thee from the mire
of this sir reverence love  wherein thou stick 
up to the ears  come  we burn daylight  ho 


romeo

nay  that not so 


mercutio

i mean  sir  in delay
we waste our lights in vain  like lamps by day 
take our good meaning  for our judgment sits
five times in that ere once in our five wits 


romeo

and we mean well in going to this mask 
but  no wit to go 


mercutio

why  may one ask 


romeo

i dream a dream to night 


mercutio

and so did i 


romeo

well  what was yours 


mercutio

that dreamers often lie 


romeo

in bed asleep  while they do dream things true 


mercutio

o  then  i see queen mab hath been with you 
she is the fairies  midwife  and she comes
in shape no bigger than an agate stone
on the fore finger of an alderman 
drawn with a team of little atomies
athwart men noses as they lie asleep 
her wagon spokes made of long spiders  legs 
the cover of the wings of grasshoppers 
the traces of the smallest spider web 
the collars of the moonshine watery beams 
her whip of cricket bone  the lash of film 
her wagoner a small grey coated gnat 
not so big as a round little worm
prick from the lazy finger of a maid 
her chariot is an empty hazel nut
made by the joiner squirrel or old grub 
time out o  mind the fairies  coachmakers 
and in this state she gallops night by night
through lovers  brains  and then they dream of love 
o courtiers  knees  that dream on court straight 
o lawyers  fingers  who straight dream on fees 
o ladies   lips  who straight on kisses dream 
which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues 
because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are 
sometime she gallops o a courtier nose 
and then dreams he of smelling out a suit 
and sometime comes she with a tithe pig tail
tickling a parson nose as a  lies asleep 
then dreams  he of another benefice 
sometime she driveth o a soldier neck 
and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats 
of breaches  ambuscadoes  spanish blades 
of healths five fathom deep  and then anon
drums in his ear  at which he starts and wakes 
and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
and sleeps again  this is that very mab
that plats the manes of horses in the night 
and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs 
which once untangled  much misfortune bodes 
this is the hag  when maids lie on their backs 
that presses them and learns them first to bear 
making them women of good carriage 
this is she 


romeo

                  peace  peace  mercutio  peace 
thou talk of nothing 


mercutio

true  i talk of dreams 
which are the children of an idle brain 
begot of nothing but vain fantasy 
which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind  who wooes
even now the frozen bosom of the north 
and  being anger d  puffs away from thence 
turning his face to the dew dropping south 


benvolio

this wind  you talk of  blows us from ourselves 
supper is done  and we shall come too late 


romeo

i fear  too early  for my mind misgives
some consequence yet hanging in the stars
shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night revels and expire the term
of a despised life closed in my breast
by some vile forfeit of untimely death 
but he  that hath the steerage of my course 
direct my sail  on  lusty gentlemen 


benvolio

strike  drum
