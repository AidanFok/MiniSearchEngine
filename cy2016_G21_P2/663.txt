some five and twenty years  and then we mask d 


second capulet

capulet

romeo

 to a servingman   what lady is that  which doth
enrich the hand
of yonder knight 


servant

i know not  sir 


romeo

o  she doth teach the torches to burn bright 
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
like a rich jewel in an ethiope ear 
beauty too rich for use  for earth too dear 
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows 
as yonder lady o her fellows shows 
the measure done  i watch her place of stand 
and  touching hers  make blessed my rude hand 
did my heart love till now  forswear it  sight 
for i ne saw true beauty till this night 


tybalt

this  by his voice  should be a montague 
fetch me my rapier  boy  what dares the slave
come hither  cover with an antic face 
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity 
now  by the stock and honour of my kin 
to strike him dead  i hold it not a sin 


capulet

why  how now  kinsman  wherefore storm you so 


tybalt

uncle  this is a montague  our foe 
a villain that is hither come in spite 
to scorn at our solemnity this night 


capulet

young romeo is it 


tybalt

 he  that villain romeo 


capulet

content thee  gentle coz  let him alone 
he bears him like a portly gentleman 
and  to say truth  verona brags of him
to be a virtuous and well govern youth 
i would not for the wealth of all the town
here in my house do him disparagement 
therefore be patient  take no note of him 
it is my will  the which if thou respect 
show a fair presence and put off these frowns 
and ill beseeming semblance for a feast 


tybalt

it fits  when such a villain is a guest 
i not endure him 


capulet

he shall be endured 
what  goodman boy  i say  he shall  go to 
am i the master here  or you  go to 
you not endure him  god shall mend my soul 
you make a mutiny among my guests 
you will set cock a hoop  you be the man 


tybalt

why  uncle   a shame 


capulet

go to  go to 
you are a saucy boy  is so  indeed 
this trick may chance to scathe you  i know what 
you must contrary me  marry   time 
well said  my hearts  you are a princox  go 
be quiet  or more light  more light  for shame 
i make you quiet  what  cheerly  my hearts 


tybalt

patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting 
i will withdraw  but this intrusion shall
now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall 
exit


romeo

 to juliet   if i profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine  the gentle fine is this 
my lips  two blushing pilgrims  ready stand
to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss 


juliet

good pilgrim  you do wrong your hand too much 
which mannerly devotion shows in this 
for saints have hands that pilgrims  hands do touch 
and palm to palm is holy palmers  kiss 


romeo

have not saints lips  and holy palmers too 


juliet

ay  pilgrim  lips that they must use in prayer 


romeo

o  then  dear saint  let lips do what hands do 
they pray  grant thou  lest faith turn to despair 


juliet

saints do not move  though grant for prayers  sake 


romeo

then move not  while my prayer effect i take 
thus from my lips  by yours  my sin is purged 


juliet

then have my lips the sin that they have took 


romeo

sin from thy lips  o trespass sweetly urged 
give me my sin again 


juliet

you kiss by the book

and a good lady  and a wise and virtuous
i nursed her daughter  that you talk withal 
i tell you  he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks 


romeo

is she a capulet 
o dear account  my life is my foe debt 


benvolio

away  begone  the sport is at the best 


romeo

ay  so i fear  the more is my unrest 


capulet
