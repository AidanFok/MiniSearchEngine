chorus

now old desire doth in his death bed lie 
and young affection gapes to be his heir 
that fair for which love groan for and would die 
with tender juliet match d  is now not fair 
now romeo is beloved and loves again 
alike betwitched by the charm of looks 
but to his foe supposed he must complain 
and she steal love sweet bait from fearful hooks 
being held a foe  he may not have access
to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear 
and she as much in love  her means much less
to meet her new beloved any where 
but passion lends them power  time means  to meet
tempering extremities with extreme sweet 
exit
