scene i  a lane by the wall of capulet orchard 


enter romeo


romeo

can i go forward when my heart is here 
turn back  dull earth  and find thy centre out 
he climbs the wall  and leaps down within it
enter benvolio and mercutio


benvolio

romeo  my cousin romeo 


mercutio

he is wise 
and  on my lie  hath stol him home to bed 


benvolio

he ran this way  and leap this orchard wall 
call  good mercutio 


mercutio

nay  i conjure too 
romeo  humours  madman  passion  lover 
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh 
speak but one rhyme  and i am satisfied 
cry but  me  pronounce but  love  and  dove 
speak to my gossip venus one fair word 
one nick name for her purblind son and heir 
young adam cupid  he that shot so trim 
when king cophetua loved the beggar maid 
he heareth not  he stirreth not  he moveth not 
the ape is dead  and i must conjure him 
i conjure thee by rosaline bright eyes 
by her high forehead and her scarlet lip 
by her fine foot  straight leg and quivering thigh
and the demesnes that there adjacent lie 
that in thy likeness thou appear to us 


benvolio

and if he hear thee  thou wilt anger him 


mercutio

this cannot anger him   anger him
to raise a spirit in his mistress  circle
of some strange nature  letting it there stand
till she had laid it and conjured it down 
that were some spite  my invocation
is fair and honest  and in his mistres s  name
i conjure only but to raise up him 


benvolio

come  he hath hid himself among these trees 
to be consorted with the humorous night 
blind is his love and best befits the dark 


mercutio

if love be blind  love cannot hit the mark 
now will he sit under a medlar tree 
and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
as maids call medlars  when they laugh alone 
romeo  that she were  o  that she were
an open et caetera  thou a poperin pear 
romeo  good night  i to my truckle bed 
this field bed is too cold for me to sleep 
come  shall we go 


benvolio

                  go  then  for  in vain
to seek him here that means not to be found
