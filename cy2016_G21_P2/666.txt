romeo

he jests at scars that never felt a wound 
juliet appears above at a window
but  soft  what light through yonder window breaks 
it is the east  and juliet is the sun 
arise  fair sun  and kill the envious moon 
who is already sick and pale with grief 
that thou her maid art far more fair than she 
be not her maid  since she is envious 
her vestal livery is but sick and green
and none but fools do wear it  cast it off 
it is my lady  o  it is my love 
o  that she knew she were 
she speaks yet she says nothing  what of that 
her eye discourses  i will answer it 
i am too bold   not to me she speaks 
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven 
having some business  do entreat her eyes
to twinkle in their spheres till they return 
what if her eyes were there  they in her head 
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars 
as daylight doth a lamp  her eyes in heaven
would through the airy region stream so bright
that birds would sing and think it were not night 
see  how she leans her cheek upon her hand 
o  that i were a glove upon that hand 
that i might touch that cheek 


juliet

ay me 


romeo

she speaks 
o  speak again  bright angel  for thou art
as glorious to this night  being o my head
as is a winged messenger of heaven
unto the white upturned wondering eyes
of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
when he bestrides the lazy pacing clouds
and sails upon the bosom of the air 


juliet

o romeo  romeo  wherefore art thou romeo 
deny thy father and refuse thy name 
or  if thou wilt not  be but sworn my love 
and i no longer be a capulet 


romeo

 aside   shall i hear more  or shall i speak at this 


juliet

 but thy name that is my enemy 
thou art thyself  though not a montague 
what montague  it is nor hand  nor foot 
nor arm  nor face  nor any other part
belonging to a man  o  be some other name 
what in a name  that which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet 
so romeo would  were he not romeo call d 
retain that dear perfection which he owes
without that title  romeo  doff thy name 
and for that name which is no part of thee
take all myself 


romeo

                  i take thee at thy word 
call me but love  and i be new baptized 
henceforth i never will be romeo 


juliet

what man art thou that thus bescreen in night
so stumblest on my counsel 


romeo

by a name
i know not how to tell thee who i am 
my name  dear saint  is hateful to myself 
because it is an enemy to thee 
had i it written  i would tear the word 


juliet

my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
of that tongue utterance  yet i know the sound 
art thou not romeo and a montague 


romeo

neither  fair saint  if either thee dislike 


juliet

how camest thou hither  tell me  and wherefore 
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb 
and the place death  considering who thou art 
if any of my kinsmen find thee here 


romeo

with love light wings did i o er perch these walls 
for stony limits cannot hold love out 
and what love can do that dares love attempt 
therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me 


juliet

if they do see thee  they will murder thee 


romeo

alack  there lies more peril in thine eye
than twenty of their swords  look thou but sweet 
and i am proof against their enmity 


juliet

i would not for the world they saw thee here 


romeo

i have night cloak to hide me from their sight 
and but thou love me  let them find me here 
my life were better ended by their hate 
than death prorogued  wanting of thy love 


juliet

by whose direction found thou out this place 


romeo

by love  who first did prompt me to inquire 
he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes 
i am no pilot  yet  wert thou as far
as that vast shore wash with the farthest sea 
i would adventure for such merchandise 


juliet

thou know the mask of night is on my face 
else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
for that which thou hast heard me speak to night
fain would i dwell on form  fain  fain deny
what i have spoke  but farewell compliment 
dost thou love me  i know thou wilt say  ay 
and i will take thy word  yet if thou swear st 
thou mayst prove false  at lovers  perjuries
then say  jove laughs  o gentle romeo 
if thou dost love  pronounce it faithfully 
or if thou think i am too quickly won 
i frown and be perverse an say thee nay 
so thou wilt woo  but else  not for the world 
in truth  fair montague  i am too fond 
and therefore thou mayst think my  light 
but trust me  gentleman  i prove more true
than those that have more cunning to be strange 
i should have been more strange  i must confess 
but that thou overheard st  ere i was ware 
my true love passion  therefore pardon me 
and not impute this yielding to light love 
which the dark night hath so discovered 


romeo

lady  by yonder blessed moon i swear
that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops 


juliet

o  swear not by the moon  the inconstant moon 
that monthly changes in her circled orb 
lest that thy love prove likewise variable 


romeo

what shall i swear by 


juliet

do not swear at all 
or  if thou wilt  swear by thy gracious self 
which is the god of my idolatry 
and i believe thee 


romeo

if my heart dear love 


juliet

well  do not swear  although i joy in thee 
i have no joy of this contract to night 
it is too rash  too unadvised  too sudden 
too like the lightning  which doth cease to be
ere one can say  lightens  sweet  good night 
this bud of love  by summer ripening breath 
may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet 
good night  good night  as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart as that within my breast 


romeo

o  wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied 


juliet

what satisfaction canst thou have to night 


romeo

the exchange of thy love faithful vow for mine 


juliet

i gave thee mine before thou didst request it 
and yet i would it were to give again 


romeo

wouldst thou withdraw it  for what purpose  love 


juliet

but to be frank  and give it thee again 
and yet i wish but for the thing i have 
my bounty is as boundless as the sea 
my love as deep  the more i give to thee 
the more i have  for both are infinite 
nurse calls within
i hear some noise within  dear love  adieu 
anon  good nurse  sweet montague  be true 
stay but a little  i will come again 
exit  above


romeo

o blessed  blessed night  i am afeard 
being in night  all this is but a dream 
too flattering sweet to be substantial 
re enter juliet  above


juliet

three words  dear romeo  and good night indeed 
if that thy bent of love be honourable 
thy purpose marriage  send me word to morrow 
by one that i procure to come to thee 
where and what time thou wilt perform the rite 
and all my fortunes at thy foot i lay
and follow thee my lord throughout the world 


nurse

 within   madam 


juliet

i come  anon but if thou mean not well 
i do beseech thee 


nurse

 within   madam 


juliet

by and by  i come 
to cease thy suit  and leave me to my grief 
to morrow will i send 


romeo

so thrive my soul 


juliet

a thousand times good night 
exit  above


romeo

a thousand times the worse  to want thy light 
love goes toward love  as schoolboys from
their books 
but love from love  toward school with heavy looks 
retiring
re enter juliet  above


juliet

hist  romeo  hist  o  for a falconer voice 
to lure this tassel gentle back again 
bondage is hoarse  and may not speak aloud 
else would i tear the cave where echo lies 
and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine 
with repetition of my romeo name 


romeo

it is my soul that calls upon my name 
how silver sweet sound lovers  tongues by night 
like softest music to attending ears 


juliet

romeo 


romeo

     my dear 


juliet

                  at what o to morrow
shall i send to thee 


romeo

at the hour of nine 


juliet

i will not fail   twenty years till then 
i have forgot why i did call thee back 


romeo

let me stand here till thou remember it 


juliet

i shall forget  to have thee still stand there 
remembering how i love thy company 


romeo

and i still stay  to have thee still forget 
forgetting any other home but this 


juliet

 almost morning  i would have thee gone 
and yet no further than a wanton bird 
who lets it hop a little from her hand 
like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves 
and with a silk thread plucks it back again 
so loving jealous of his liberty 


romeo

i would i were thy bird 


juliet

sweet  so would i 
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing 
good night  good night  parting is such
sweet sorrow 
that i shall say good night till it be morrow 
exit above


romeo

sleep dwell upon thine eyes  peace in thy breast 
would i were sleep and peace  so sweet to rest 
hence will i to my ghostly father cell 
his help to crave  and my dear hap to tell 
exit
