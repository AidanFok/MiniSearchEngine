enter friar laurence  with a basket


friar laurence

the grey eyed morn smiles on the frowning night 
chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light 
and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
from forth day path and titan fiery wheels 
now  ere the sun advance his burning eye 
the day to cheer and night dank dew to dry 
i must up fill this osier cage of ours
with baleful weeds and precious juiced flowers 
the earth that nature mother is her tomb 
what is her burying grave that is her womb 
and from her womb children of divers kind
we sucking on her natural bosom find 
many for many virtues excellent 
none but for some and yet all different 
o  mickle is the powerful grace that lies
in herbs  plants  stones  and their true qualities 
for nought so vile that on the earth doth live
but to the earth some special good doth give 
nor aught so good but strain from that fair use
revolts from true birth  stumbling on abuse 
virtue itself turns vice  being misapplied 
and vice sometimes by action dignified 
within the infant rind of this small flower
poison hath residence and medicine power 
for this  being smelt  with that part cheers each part 
being tasted  slays all senses with the heart 
two such opposed kings encamp them still
in man as well as herbs  grace and rude will 
and where the worser is predominant 
full soon the canker death eats up that plant 
enter romeo


romeo

good morrow  father 


friar laurence

benedicite 
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me 
young son  it argues a distemper head
so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed 
care keeps his watch in every old man eye 
and where care lodges  sleep will never lie 
but where unbruised youth with unstuff brain
doth couch his limbs  there golden sleep doth reign 
therefore thy earliness doth me assure
thou art up roused by some distemperature 
or if not so  then here i hit it right 
our romeo hath not been in bed to night 


romeo

that last is true  the sweeter rest was mine 


friar laurence

god pardon sin  wast thou with rosaline 


romeo

with rosaline  my ghostly father  no 
i have forgot that name  and that name woe 


friar laurence

that my good son  but where hast thou been  then 


romeo

i tell thee  ere thou ask it me again 
i have been feasting with mine enemy 
where on a sudden one hath wounded me 
that by me wounded  both our remedies
within thy help and holy physic lies 
i bear no hatred  blessed man  for  lo 
my intercession likewise steads my foe 


friar laurence

be plain  good son  and homely in thy drift 
riddling confession finds but riddling shrift 


romeo

then plainly know my heart dear love is set
on the fair daughter of rich capulet 
as mine on hers  so hers is set on mine 
and all combined  save what thou must combine
by holy marriage  when and where and how
we met  we woo and made exchange of vow 
i tell thee as we pass  but this i pray 
that thou consent to marry us to day 


friar laurence

holy saint francis  what a change is here 
is rosaline  whom thou didst love so dear 
so soon forsaken  young men love then lies
not truly in their hearts  but in their eyes 
jesu maria  what a deal of brine
hath wash thy sallow cheeks for rosaline 
how much salt water thrown away in waste 
to season love  that of it doth not taste 
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears 
thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears 
lo  here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
of an old tear that is not wash off yet 
if e thou wast thyself and these woes thine 
thou and these woes were all for rosaline 
and art thou changed  pronounce this sentence then 
women may fall  when there no strength in men 


romeo

thou chid me oft for loving rosaline 


friar laurence

for doting  not for loving  pupil mine 


romeo

and bad me bury love 


friar laurence

not in a grave 
to lay one in  another out to have 


romeo

i pray thee  chide not  she whom i love now
doth grace for grace and love for love allow 
the other did not so 


friar laurence

o  she knew well
thy love did read by rote and could not spell 
but come  young waverer  come  go with me 
in one respect i thy assistant be 
for this alliance may so happy prove 
to turn your households  rancour to pure love 


romeo

o  let us hence  i stand on sudden haste 


friar laurence

wisely and slow  they stumble that run fast 
exeunt
