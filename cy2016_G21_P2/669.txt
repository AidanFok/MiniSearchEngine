the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse 
in half an hour she promised to return 
perchance she cannot meet him  that not so 
o  she is lame  love heralds should be thoughts 
which ten times faster glide than the sun beams 
driving back shadows over louring hills 
therefore do nimble pinion doves draw love 
and therefore hath the wind swift cupid wings 
now is the sun upon the highmost hill
of this day journey  and from nine till twelve
is three long hours  yet she is not come 
had she affections and warm youthful blood 
she would be as swift in motion as a ball 
my words would bandy her to my sweet love 
and his to me 
but old folks  many feign as they were dead 
unwieldy  slow  heavy and pale as lead 
o god  she comes 
enter nurse and peter
o honey nurse  what news 
hast thou met with him  send thy man away 


nurse

peter  stay at the gate 
exit peter


juliet

now  good sweet nurse o lord  why look thou sad 
though news be sad  yet tell them merrily 
if good  thou shamest the music of sweet news
by playing it to me with so sour a face 


nurse

i am a weary  give me leave awhile 
fie  how my bones ache  what a jaunt have i had 


juliet

i would thou hadst my bones  and i thy news 
nay  come  i pray thee  speak  good  good nurse  speak 


nurse

jesu  what haste  can you not stay awhile 
do you not see that i am out of breath 


juliet

how art thou out of breath  when thou hast breath
to say to me that thou art out of breath 
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay
is longer than the tale thou dost excuse 
is thy news good  or bad  answer to that 
say either  and i stay the circumstance 
let me be satisfied  is good or bad 


nurse

well  you have made a simple choice  you know not
how to choose a man  romeo  no  not he  though his
face be better than any man s  yet his leg excels
all men s  and for a hand  and a foot  and a body 
though they be not to be talked on  yet they are
past compare  he is not the flower of courtesy 
but  i warrant him  as gentle as a lamb  go thy
ways  wench  serve god  what  have you dined at home 


juliet

nurse

lord  how my head aches  what a head have i 
it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces 
my back o  t  other side o  my back  my back 
beshrew your heart for sending me about 
to catch my death with jaunting up and down 


juliet

there stays a husband to make you a wife 
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks 
they be in scarlet straight at any news 
hie you to church  i must another way 
to fetch a ladder  by the which your love
must climb a bird nest soon when it is dark 
i am the drudge and toil in your delight 
but you shall bear the burden soon at night 
go  i to dinner  hie you to the cell 


juliet

hie to high fortune  honest nurse  farewell
