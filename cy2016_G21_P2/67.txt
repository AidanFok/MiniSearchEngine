exeunt


queen margaret

my lord of suffolk  say  is this the guise 
is this the fashion in the court of england 
is this the government of britain isle 
and this the royalty of albion king 
what shall king henry be a pupil still
under the surly gloucester governance 
am i a queen in title and in style 
and must be made a subject to a duke 
i tell thee  pole  when in the city tours
thou ran a tilt in honour of my love
and stolest away the ladies  hearts of france 
i thought king henry had resembled thee
in courage  courtship and proportion 
but all his mind is bent to holiness 
to number ave maries on his beads 
his champions are the prophets and apostles 
his weapons holy saws of sacred writ 
his study is his tilt yard  and his loves
are brazen images of canonized saints 
i would the college of the cardinals
would choose him pope  and carry him to rome 
and set the triple crown upon his head 
that were a state fit for his holiness 


suffolk

madam  be patient  as i was cause
your highness came to england  so will i
in england work your grace full content 


queen margaret

beside the haughty protector  have we beaufort 
the imperious churchman  somerset  buckingham 
and grumbling york  and not the least of these
but can do more in england than the king 


suffolk

and he of these that can do most of all
cannot do more in england than the nevils 
salisbury and warwick are no simple peers 


queen margaret

not all these lords do vex me half so much
as that proud dame  the lord protector wife 
she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies 
more like an empress than duke humphrey wife 
strangers in court do take her for the queen 
she bears a duke revenues on her back 
and in her heart she scorns our poverty 
shall i not live to be avenged on her 
contemptuous base born callet as she is 
she vaunted  her minions t day 
the very train of her worst wearing gown
was better worth than all my father lands 
till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter 


suffolk

madam  myself have limed a bush for her 
and placed a quire of such enticing birds 
that she will light to listen to the lays 
and never mount to trouble you again 
so  let her rest  and  madam  list to me 
for i am bold to counsel you in this 
although we fancy not the cardinal 
yet must we join with him and with the lords 
till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace 
as for the duke of york  this late complaint
will make but little for his benefit 
so  one by one  we weed them all at last 
and you yourself shall steer the happy helm 
sound a sennet  enter king henry vi  gloucester   cardinal  buckingham  york  somerset  salisbury  warwick  and the duchess


king henry vi

for my part  noble lords  i care not which 
or somerset or york  all one to me 


york

if york have ill demean himself in france 
then let him be denay the regentship 


somerset

if somerset be unworthy of the place 
let york be regent  i will yield to him 


warwick

whether your grace be worthy  yea or no 
dispute not that  york is the worthier 


cardinal

ambitious warwick  let thy betters speak 


warwick

the cardinal not my better in the field 


buckingham

all in this presence are thy betters  warwick 


warwick

warwick may live to be the best of all 


salisbury

peace  son  and show some reason  buckingham 
why somerset should be preferred in this 


queen margaret

because the king  forsooth  will have it so 


gloucester

madam  the king is old enough himself
to give his censure  these are no women matters 


queen margaret

if he be old enough  what needs your grace
to be protector of his excellence 


gloucester

madam  i am protector of the realm 
and  at his pleasure  will resign my place 


suffolk

resign it then and leave thine insolence 
since thou wert king as who is king but thou 
the commonwealth hath daily run to wreck 
the dauphin hath prevail beyond the seas 
and all the peers and nobles of the realm
have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty 


cardinal

the commons hast thou rack d  the clergy bags
are lank and lean with thy extortions 


somerset

thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife attire
have cost a mass of public treasury 


buckingham

thy cruelty in execution
upon offenders  hath exceeded law 
and left thee to the mercy of the law 


queen margaret

they sale of offices and towns in france 
if they were known  as the suspect is great 
would make thee quickly hop without thy head 
exit gloucester  queen margaret drops her fan
give me my fan  what  minion  can ye not 
she gives the duchess a box on the ear
i cry you mercy  madam  was it you 


duchess

was i  yea  i it was  proud frenchwoman 
could i come near your beauty with my nails 
i set my ten commandments in your face 


king henry vi

sweet aunt  be quiet   against her will 


duchess

against her will  good king  look to in time 
she hamper thee  and dandle thee like a baby 
though in this place most master wear no breeches 
she shall not strike dame eleanor unrevenged 
exit


buckingham

lord cardinal  i will follow eleanor 
and listen after humphrey  how he proceeds 
she tickled now  her fume needs no spurs 
she gallop far enough to her destruction 
exit
re enter gloucester


gloucester

now  lords  my choler being over blown
with walking once about the quadrangle 
i come to talk of commonwealth affairs 
as for your spiteful false objections 
prove them  and i lie open to the law 
but god in mercy so deal with my soul 
as i in duty love my king and country 
but  to the matter that we have in hand 
i say  my sovereign  york is meetest man
to be your regent in the realm of france 


suffolk

before we make election  give me leave
to show some reason  of no little force 
that york is most unmeet of any man 


york

i tell thee  suffolk  why i am unmeet 
first  for i cannot flatter thee in pride 
next  if i be appointed for the place 
my lord of somerset will keep me here 
without discharge  money  or furniture 
till france be won into the dauphin hands 
last time  i danced attendance on his will
till paris was besieged  famish d  and lost 


warwick

that can i witness  and a fouler fact
did never traitor in the land commit 


suffolk

peace  headstrong warwick 


warwick

image of pride  why should i hold my peace 
enter horner  the armourer  and his man peter  guarded


suffolk

because here is a man accused of treason 
pray god the duke of york excuse himself 


york

doth any one accuse york for a traitor 


king henry vi

what mean thou  suffolk  tell me  what are these 


suffolk

please it your majesty  this is the man
that doth accuse his master of high treason 
his words were these  that richard  duke of york 
was rightful heir unto the english crown
and that your majesty was a usurper 


king henry vi

say  man  were these thy words 


horner

an shall please your majesty  i never said nor
thought any such matter  god is my witness  i am
falsely accused by the villain 


peter

by these ten bones  my lords  he did speak them to
me in the garret one night  as we were scouring my
lord of york armour 


york

base dunghill villain and mechanical 
i have thy head for this thy traitor speech 
i do beseech your royal majesty 
let him have all the rigor of the law 


horner

alas  my lord  hang me  if ever i spake the words 
my accuser is my  prentice  and when i did correct
him for his fault the other day  he did vow upon his
knees he would be even with me  i have good
witness of this  therefore i beseech your majesty 
do not cast away an honest man for a villain 
accusation 


king henry vi

uncle  what shall we say to this in law 


gloucester

this doom  my lord  if i may judge 
let somerset be regent over the french 
because in york this breeds suspicion 
and let these have a day appointed them
for single combat in convenient place 
for he hath witness of his servant malice 
this is the law  and this duke humphrey doom 


somerset

i humbly thank your royal majesty 


horner

and i accept the combat willingly 


peter

alas  my lord  i cannot fight  for god sake  pity
my case  the spite of man prevaileth against me  o
lord  have mercy upon me  i shall never be able to
fight a blow  o lord  my heart
