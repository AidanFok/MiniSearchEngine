scene ii  capulet orchard 


enter juliet


juliet

gallop apace  you fiery footed steeds 
towards phoebus  lodging  such a wagoner
as phaethon would whip you to the west 
and bring in cloudy night immediately 
spread thy close curtain  love performing night 
that runaway eyes may wink and romeo
leap to these arms  untalk of and unseen 
lovers can see to do their amorous rites
by their own beauties  or  if love be blind 
it best agrees with night  come  civil night 
thou sober suited matron  all in black 
and learn me how to lose a winning match 
play for a pair of stainless maidenhoods 
hood my unmann blood  bating in my cheeks 
with thy black mantle  till strange love  grown bold 
think true love acted simple modesty 
come  night  come  romeo  come  thou day in night 
for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
whiter than new snow on a raven back 
come  gentle night  come  loving  black brow night 
give me my romeo  and  when he shall die 
take him and cut him out in little stars 
and he will make the face of heaven so fine
that all the world will be in love with night
and pay no worship to the garish sun 
o  i have bought the mansion of a love 
but not possess it  and  though i am sold 
not yet enjoy d  so tedious is this day
as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child that hath new robes
and may not wear them  o  here comes my nurse 
and she brings news  and every tongue that speaks
but romeo name speaks heavenly eloquence 
enter nurse  with cords
now  nurse  what news  what hast thou there  the cords
that romeo bid thee fetch 


nurse

ay  ay  the cords 
throws them down


juliet

ay me  what news  why dost thou wring thy hands 


nurse

ah  well a day  he dead  he dead  he dead 
we are undone  lady  we are undone 
alack the day  he gone  he kill d  he dead 


juliet

can heaven be so envious 


nurse

romeo can 
though heaven cannot  o romeo  romeo 
who ever would have thought it  romeo 


juliet

what devil art thou  that dost torment me thus 
this torture should be roar in dismal hell 
hath romeo slain himself  say thou but  i 
and that bare vowel  i  shall poison more
than the death darting eye of cockatrice 
i am not i  if there be such an i 
or those eyes shut  that make thee answer  i 
if he be slain  say  i  or if not  no 
brief sounds determine of my weal or woe 


nurse

i saw the wound  i saw it with mine eyes 
god save the mark here on his manly breast 
a piteous corse  a bloody piteous corse 
pale  pale as ashes  all bedaub in blood 
all in gore blood  i swounded at the sight 


juliet

o  break  my heart  poor bankrupt  break at once 
to prison  eyes  ne look on liberty 
vile earth  to earth resign  end motion here 
and thou and romeo press one heavy bier 


nurse

o tybalt  tybalt  the best friend i had 
o courteous tybalt  honest gentleman 
that ever i should live to see thee dead 


juliet

what storm is this that blows so contrary 
is romeo slaughter d  and is tybalt dead 
my dear loved cousin  and my dearer lord 
then  dreadful trumpet  sound the general doom 
for who is living  if those two are gone 


nurse

tybalt is gone  and romeo banished 
romeo that kill him  he is banished 


juliet

o god  did romeo hand shed tybalt blood 


nurse

it did  it did  alas the day  it did 


juliet

o serpent heart  hid with a flowering face 
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave 
beautiful tyrant  fiend angelical 
dove feather raven  wolvish ravening lamb 
despised substance of divinest show 
just opposite to what thou justly seem st 
a damned saint  an honourable villain 
o nature  what hadst thou to do in hell 
when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
in moral paradise of such sweet flesh 
was ever book containing such vile matter
so fairly bound  o that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace 


nurse

there no trust 
no faith  no honesty in men  all perjured 
all forsworn  all naught  all dissemblers 
ah  where my man  give me some aqua vitae 
these griefs  these woes  these sorrows make me old 
shame come to romeo 


juliet

blister be thy tongue
for such a wish  he was not born to shame 
upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit 
for  a throne where honour may be crown 
sole monarch of the universal earth 
o  what a beast was i to chide at him 


nurse

will you speak well of him that kill your cousin 


juliet

shall i speak ill of him that is my husband 
ah  poor my lord  what tongue shall smooth thy name 
when i  thy three hours wife  have mangled it 
but  wherefore  villain  didst thou kill my cousin 
that villain cousin would have kill my husband 
back  foolish tears  back to your native spring 
your tributary drops belong to woe 
which you  mistaking  offer up to joy 
my husband lives  that tybalt would have slain 
and tybalt dead  that would have slain my husband 
all this is comfort  wherefore weep i then 
some word there was  worser than tybalt death 
that murder me  i would forget it fain 
but  o  it presses to my memory 
like damned guilty deeds to sinners  minds 
 is dead  and romeo banished 
that  banished  that one word  banished 
hath slain ten thousand tybalts  tybalt death
was woe enough  if it had ended there 
or  if sour woe delights in fellowship
and needly will be rank with other griefs 
why follow not  when she said  tybalt dead 
thy father  or thy mother  nay  or both 
which modern lamentations might have moved 
but with a rear ward following tybalt death 
 is banished  to speak that word 
is father  mother  tybalt  romeo  juliet 
all slain  all dead   is banished 
there is no end  no limit  measure  bound 
in that word death  no words can that woe sound 
where is my father  and my mother  nurse 


nurse

weeping and wailing over tybalt corse 
will you go to them  i will bring you thither 


juliet

wash they his wounds with tears  mine shall be spent 
when theirs are dry  for romeo banishment 
take up those cords  poor ropes  you are beguiled 
both you and i  for romeo is exiled 
he made you for a highway to my bed 
but i  a maid  die maiden widowed 
come  cords  come  nurse  i to my wedding bed 
and death  not romeo  take my maidenhead 


nurse

hie to your chamber  i find romeo
to comfort you  i wot well where he is 
hark ye  your romeo will be here at night 
i to him  he is hid at laurence  cell 


juliet

o  find him  give this ring to my true knight 
and bid him come to take his last farewell 
exeunt
