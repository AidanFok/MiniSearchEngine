enter friar laurence


friar laurence

romeo  come forth  come forth  thou fearful man 
affliction is enamour of thy parts 
and thou art wedded to calamity 
enter romeo


romeo

father  what news  what is the prince doom 
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand 
that i yet know not 


friar laurence

too familiar
is my dear son with such sour company 
i bring thee tidings of the prince doom 


romeo

what less than dooms day is the prince doom 


friar laurence

a gentler judgment vanish from his lips 
not body death  but body banishment 


romeo

ha  banishment  be merciful  say  death 
for exile hath more terror in his look 
much more than death  do not say  banishment 


friar laurence

hence from verona art thou banished 
be patient  for the world is broad and wide 


romeo

there is no world without verona walls 
but purgatory  torture  hell itself 
hence banished is banish from the world 
and world exile is death  then banished 
is death mis term d  calling death banishment 
thou cutt my head off with a golden axe 
and smilest upon the stroke that murders me 


friar laurence

o deadly sin  o rude unthankfulness 
thy fault our law calls death  but the kind prince 
taking thy part  hath rush aside the law 
and turn that black word death to banishment 
this is dear mercy  and thou seest it not 


romeo

 torture  and not mercy  heaven is here 
where juliet lives  and every cat and dog
and little mouse  every unworthy thing 
live here in heaven and may look on her 
but romeo may not  more validity 
more honourable state  more courtship lives
in carrion flies than romeo  they my seize
on the white wonder of dear juliet hand
and steal immortal blessing from her lips 
who even in pure and vestal modesty 
still blush  as thinking their own kisses sin 
but romeo may not  he is banished 
flies may do this  but i from this must fly 
they are free men  but i am banished 
and say thou yet that exile is not death 
hadst thou no poison mix d  no sharp ground knife 
no sudden mean of death  though ne so mean 
but  banished  to kill me banished 
o friar  the damned use that word in hell 
howlings attend it  how hast thou the heart 
being a divine  a ghostly confessor 
a sin absolver  and my friend profess d 
to mangle me with that word  banished 


friar laurence

thou fond mad man  hear me but speak a word 


romeo

o  thou wilt speak again of banishment 


friar laurence

i give thee armour to keep off that word 
adversity sweet milk  philosophy 
to comfort thee  though thou art banished 


romeo

yet  banished  hang up philosophy 
unless philosophy can make a juliet 
displant a town  reverse a prince doom 
it helps not  it prevails not  talk no more 


friar laurence

o  then i see that madmen have no ears 


romeo

how should they  when that wise men have no eyes 


friar laurence

let me dispute with thee of thy estate 


romeo

thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel 
wert thou as young as i  juliet thy love 
an hour but married  tybalt murdered 
doting like me and like me banished 
then mightst thou speak  then mightst thou tear thy hair 
and fall upon the ground  as i do now 
taking the measure of an unmade grave 
knocking within


friar laurence

arise  one knocks  good romeo  hide thyself 


romeo

not i  unless the breath of heartsick groans 
mist like  infold me from the search of eyes 
knocking


friar laurence

hark  how they knock  who there  romeo  arise 
thou wilt be taken  stay awhile  stand up 
knocking
run to my study  by and by  god will 
what simpleness is this  i come  i come 
knocking
who knocks so hard  whence come you  what your will 


nurse

 within   let me come in  and you shall know
my errand 
i come from lady juliet 


friar laurence

welcome  then 
enter nurse


nurse

o holy friar  o  tell me  holy friar 
where is my lady lord  where romeo 


friar laurence

there on the ground  with his own tears made drunk 


nurse

o  he is even in my mistress  case 
just in her case  o woful sympathy 
piteous predicament  even so lies she 
blubbering and weeping  weeping and blubbering 
stand up  stand up  stand  and you be a man 
for juliet sake  for her sake  rise and stand 
why should you fall into so deep an o 


romeo

nurse 


nurse

ah sir  ah sir  well  death the end of all 


romeo

spakest thou of juliet  how is it with her 
doth she not think me an old murderer 
now i have stain the childhood of our joy
with blood removed but little from her own 
where is she  and how doth she  and what says
my conceal lady to our cancell love 


nurse

o  she says nothing  sir  but weeps and weeps 
and now falls on her bed  and then starts up 
and tybalt calls  and then on romeo cries 
and then down falls again 


romeo

as if that name 
shot from the deadly level of a gun 
did murder her  as that name cursed hand
murder her kinsman  o  tell me  friar  tell me 
in what vile part of this anatomy
doth my name lodge  tell me  that i may sack
the hateful mansion 
drawing his sword


friar laurence

hold thy desperate hand 
art thou a man  thy form cries out thou art 
thy tears are womanish  thy wild acts denote
the unreasonable fury of a beast 
unseemly woman in a seeming man 
or ill beseeming beast in seeming both 
thou hast amazed me  by my holy order 
i thought thy disposition better temper d 
hast thou slain tybalt  wilt thou slay thyself 
and stay thy lady too that lives in thee 
by doing damned hate upon thyself 
why rail thou on thy birth  the heaven  and earth 
since birth  and heaven  and earth  all three do meet
in thee at once  which thou at once wouldst lose 
fie  fie  thou shamest thy shape  thy love  thy wit 
which  like a usurer  abound in all 
and usest none in that true use indeed
which should bedeck thy shape  thy love  thy wit 
thy noble shape is but a form of wax 
digressing from the valour of a man 
thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury 
killing that love which thou hast vow to cherish 
thy wit  that ornament to shape and love 
misshapen in the conduct of them both 
like powder in a skitless soldier flask 
is set afire by thine own ignorance 
and thou dismember with thine own defence 
what  rouse thee  man  thy juliet is alive 
for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead 
there art thou happy  tybalt would kill thee 
but thou slew tybalt  there are thou happy too 
the law that threaten death becomes thy friend
and turns it to exile  there art thou happy 
a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back 
happiness courts thee in her best array 
but  like a misbehaved and sullen wench 
thou pout upon thy fortune and thy love 
take heed  take heed  for such die miserable 
go  get thee to thy love  as was decreed 
ascend her chamber  hence and comfort her 
but look thou stay not till the watch be set 
for then thou canst not pass to mantua 
where thou shalt live  till we can find a time
to blaze your marriage  reconcile your friends 
beg pardon of the prince  and call thee back
with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
than thou went forth in lamentation 
go before  nurse  commend me to thy lady 
and bid her hasten all the house to bed 
which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto 
romeo is coming 


nurse

o lord  i could have stay here all the night
to hear good counsel  o  what learning is 
my lord  i tell my lady you will come 


romeo

do so  and bid my sweet prepare to chide 


nurse

here  sir  a ring she bid me give you  sir 
hie you  make haste  for it grows very late 
exit


romeo

how well my comfort is revived by this 


friar laurence

go hence  good night  and here stands all your state 
either be gone before the watch be set 
or by the break of day disguised from hence 
sojourn in mantua  i find out your man 
and he shall signify from time to time
every good hap to you that chances here 
give me thy hand   late  farewell  good night 


romeo

but that a joy past joy calls out on me 
it were a grief  so brief to part with thee  farewell 
exeunt
