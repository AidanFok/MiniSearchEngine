enter capulet  lady capulet  and paris


capulet

things have fall out  sir  so unluckily 
that we have had no time to move our daughter 
look you  she loved her kinsman tybalt dearly 
and so did i well  we were born to die 
 very late  she not come down to night 
i promise you  but for your company 
i would have been a bed an hour ago 


paris

these times of woe afford no time to woo 
madam  good night  commend me to your daughter 


lady capulet

i will  and know her mind early to morrow 
to night she is mew up to her heaviness 


capulet

sir paris  i will make a desperate tender
of my child love  i think she will be ruled
in all respects by me  nay  more  i doubt it not 
wife  go you to her ere you go to bed 
acquaint her here of my son paris  love 
and bid her  mark you me  on wednesday next 
but  soft  what day is this 


paris

monday  my lord 


capulet

monday  ha  ha  well  wednesday is too soon 
o  thursday let it be  o  thursday  tell her 
she shall be married to this noble earl 
will you be ready  do you like this haste 
we keep no great ado a friend or two 
for  hark you  tybalt being slain so late 
it may be thought we held him carelessly 
being our kinsman  if we revel much 
therefore we have some half a dozen friends 
and there an end  but what say you to thursday 


paris

my lord  i would that thursday were to morrow 


capulet

well get you gone  o  thursday be it  then 
go you to juliet ere you go to bed 
prepare her  wife  against this wedding day 
farewell  my lord  light to my chamber  ho 
afore me  it is so very very late 
that we may call it early by and by 
good night
