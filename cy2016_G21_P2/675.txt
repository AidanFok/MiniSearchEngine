scene v  capulet orchard 


enter romeo and juliet above  at the window


juliet

wilt thou be gone  it is not yet near day 
it was the nightingale  and not the lark 
that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear 
nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree 
believe me  love  it was the nightingale 


romeo

it was the lark  the herald of the morn 
no nightingale  look  love  what envious streaks
do lace the severing clouds in yonder east 
night candles are burnt out  and jocund day
stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops 
i must be gone and live  or stay and die 


juliet

yon light is not day light  i know it  i 
it is some meteor that the sun exhales 
to be to thee this night a torch bearer 
and light thee on thy way to mantua 
therefore stay yet  thou need not to be gone 


romeo

let me be ta en  let me be put to death 
i am content  so thou wilt have it so 
i say yon grey is not the morning eye 
 but the pale reflex of cynthia brow 
nor that is not the lark  whose notes do beat
the vaulty heaven so high above our heads 
i have more care to stay than will to go 
come  death  and welcome  juliet wills it so 
how is t  my soul  let talk  it is not day 


juliet

it is  it is  hie hence  be gone  away 
it is the lark that sings so out of tune 
straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps 
some say the lark makes sweet division 
this doth not so  for she divideth us 
some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes 
o  now i would they had changed voices too 
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray 
hunting thee hence with hunt s up to the day 
o  now be gone  more light and light it grows 


romeo

more light and light  more dark and dark our woes 
enter nurse  to the chamber


nurse

madam 


juliet

nurse 


nurse

your lady mother is coming to your chamber 
the day is broke  be wary  look about 
exit


juliet

then  window  let day in  and let life out 


romeo

farewell  farewell  one kiss  and i descend 
he goeth down


juliet

art thou gone so  love  lord  ay  husband  friend 
i must hear from thee every day in the hour 
for in a minute there are many days 
o  by this count i shall be much in years
ere i again behold my romeo 


romeo

farewell 
i will omit no opportunity
that may convey my greetings  love  to thee 


juliet

o think thou we shall ever meet again 


romeo

i doubt it not  and all these woes shall serve
for sweet discourses in our time to come 


juliet

o god  i have an ill divining soul 
methinks i see thee  now thou art below 
as one dead in the bottom of a tomb 
either my eyesight fails  or thou look pale 


romeo

and trust me  love  in my eye so do you 
dry sorrow drinks our blood  adieu  adieu 
exit


juliet

o fortune  fortune  all men call thee fickle 
if thou art fickle  what dost thou with him 
that is renown for faith  be fickle  fortune 
for then  i hope  thou wilt not keep him long 
but send him back 


lady capulet

 within          ho  daughter  are you up 


juliet

who is that calls  is it my lady mother 
is she not down so late  or up so early 
what unaccustom cause procures her hither 
enter lady capulet


lady capulet

why  how now  juliet 


juliet

madam  i am not well 


lady capulet

evermore weeping for your cousin death 
what  wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears 
an if thou couldst  thou couldst not make him live 
therefore  have done  some grief shows much of love 
but much of grief shows still some want of wit 


juliet

yet let me weep for such a feeling loss 


lady capulet

so shall you feel the loss  but not the friend
which you weep for 


juliet

feeling so the loss 
cannot choose but ever weep the friend 


lady capulet

well  girl  thou weep not so much for his death 
as that the villain lives which slaughter him 


juliet

what villain madam 


lady capulet

that same villain  romeo 


juliet

 aside   villain and he be many miles asunder 
god pardon him  i do  with all my heart 
and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart 


lady capulet

that is  because the traitor murderer lives 


juliet

ay  madam  from the reach of these my hands 
would none but i might venge my cousin death 


lady capulet

we will have vengeance for it  fear thou not 
then weep no more  i send to one in mantua 
where that same banish runagate doth live 
shall give him such an unaccustom dram 
that he shall soon keep tybalt company 
and then  i hope  thou wilt be satisfied 


juliet

indeed  i never shall be satisfied
with romeo  till i behold him dead 
is my poor heart for a kinsman vex d 
madam  if you could find out but a man
to bear a poison  i would temper it 
that romeo should  upon receipt thereof 
soon sleep in quiet  o  how my heart abhors
to hear him named  and cannot come to him 
to wreak the love i bore my cousin
upon his body that slaughter him 


lady capulet

find thou the means  and i find such a man 
but now i tell thee joyful tidings  girl 


juliet

and joy comes well in such a needy time 
what are they  i beseech your ladyship 


lady capulet

well  well  thou hast a careful father  child 
one who  to put thee from thy heaviness 
hath sorted out a sudden day of joy 
that thou expect not nor i look not for 


juliet

madam  in happy time  what day is that 


lady capulet

marry  my child  early next thursday morn 
the gallant  young and noble gentleman 
the county paris  at saint peter church 
shall happily make thee there a joyful bride 


juliet

now  by saint peter church and peter too 
he shall not make me there a joyful bride 
i wonder at this haste  that i must wed
ere he  that should be husband  comes to woo 
i pray you  tell my lord and father  madam 
i will not marry yet  and  when i do  i swear 
it shall be romeo  whom you know i hate 
rather than paris  these are news indeed 


lady capulet

here comes your father  tell him so yourself 
and see how he will take it at your hands 
enter capulet and nurse


capulet

when the sun sets  the air doth drizzle dew 
but for the sunset of my brother son
it rains downright 
how now  a conduit  girl  what  still in tears 
evermore showering  in one little body
thou counterfeit a bark  a sea  a wind 
for still thy eyes  which i may call the sea 
do ebb and flow with tears  the bark thy body is 
sailing in this salt flood  the winds  thy sighs 
who  raging with thy tears  and they with them 
without a sudden calm  will overset
thy tempest tossed body  how now  wife 
have you deliver to her our decree 


lady capulet

ay  sir  but she will none  she gives you thanks 
i would the fool were married to her grave 


capulet

soft  take me with you  take me with you  wife 
how  will she none  doth she not give us thanks 
is she not proud  doth she not count her blest 
unworthy as she is  that we have wrought
so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom 


juliet

not proud  you have  but thankful  that you have 
proud can i never be of what i hate 
but thankful even for hate  that is meant love 


capulet

how now  how now  chop logic  what is this 
 proud  and  thank you  and  thank you not 
and yet  proud  mistress minion  you 
thank me no thankings  nor  proud me no prouds 
but fettle your fine joints  thursday next 
to go with paris to saint peter church 
or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither 
out  you green sickness carrion  out  you baggage 
you tallow face 


lady capulet

                  fie  fie  what  are you mad 


juliet

good father  i beseech you on my knees 
hear me with patience but to speak a word 


capulet

hang thee  young baggage  disobedient wretch 
i tell thee what  get thee to church o  thursday 
or never after look me in the face 
speak not  reply not  do not answer me 
my fingers itch  wife  we scarce thought us blest
that god had lent us but this only child 
but now i see this one is one too much 
and that we have a curse in having her 
out on her  hilding 


nurse

god in heaven bless her 
you are to blame  my lord  to rate her so 


capulet

and why  my lady wisdom  hold your tongue 
good prudence  smatter with your gossips  go 


nurse

i speak no treason 


capulet

o  god ye god den 


nurse

may not one speak 


capulet

                  peace  you mumbling fool 
utter your gravity o a gossip bowl 
for here we need it not 


lady capulet

you are too hot 


capulet

god bread  it makes me mad 
day  night  hour  tide  time  work  play 
alone  in company  still my care hath been
to have her match d  and having now provided
a gentleman of noble parentage 
of fair demesnes  youthful  and nobly train d 
stuff d  as they say  with honourable parts 
proportion as one thought would wish a man 
and then to have a wretched puling fool 
a whining mammet  in her fortune tender 
to answer  i not wed  i cannot love 
i am too young  i pray you  pardon me 
but  as you will not wed  i pardon you 
graze where you will you shall not house with me 
look to t  think on t  i do not use to jest 
thursday is near  lay hand on heart  advise 
an you be mine  i give you to my friend 
and you be not  hang  beg  starve  die in
the streets 
for  by my soul  i ne acknowledge thee 
nor what is mine shall never do thee good 
trust to t  bethink you  i not be forsworn 
exit


juliet

is there no pity sitting in the clouds 
that sees into the bottom of my grief 
o  sweet my mother  cast me not away 
delay this marriage for a month  a week 
or  if you do not  make the bridal bed
in that dim monument where tybalt lies 


lady capulet

talk not to me  for i not speak a word 
do as thou wilt  for i have done with thee 
exit


juliet

o god o nurse  how shall this be prevented 
my husband is on earth  my faith in heaven 
how shall that faith return again to earth 
unless that husband send it me from heaven
by leaving earth  comfort me  counsel me 
alack  alack  that heaven should practise stratagems
upon so soft a subject as myself 
what say thou  hast thou not a word of joy 
some comfort  nurse 


nurse

faith  here it is 
romeo is banish d  and all the world to nothing 
that he dares ne come back to challenge you 
or  if he do  it needs must be by stealth 
then  since the case so stands as now it doth 
i think it best you married with the county 
o  he a lovely gentleman 
romeo a dishclout to him  an eagle  madam 
hath not so green  so quick  so fair an eye
as paris hath  beshrew my very heart 
i think you are happy in this second match 
for it excels your first  or if it did not 
your first is dead  or  as good he were 
as living here and you no use of him 


juliet

speakest thou from thy heart 


nurse

and from my soul too 
or else beshrew them both 


juliet

amen 


nurse

what 


juliet

well  thou hast comforted me marvellous much 
go in  and tell my lady i am gone 
having displeased my father  to laurence  cell 
to make confession and to be absolved 


nurse

marry  i will  and this is wisely done 
exit


juliet

ancient damnation  o most wicked fiend 
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn 
or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
which she hath praised him with above compare
so many thousand times  go  counsellor 
thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain 
i to the friar  to know his remedy 
if all else fail  myself have power to die
