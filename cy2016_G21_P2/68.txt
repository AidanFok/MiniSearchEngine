bolingbroke

patience  good lady  wizards know their times 
deep night  dark night  the silent of the night 
the time of night when troy was set on fire 
the time when screech owls cry and ban dogs howl 
and spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves 
that time best fits the work we have in hand 
madam  sit you and fear not  whom we raise 
we will make fast within a hallow verge 
here they do the ceremonies belonging  and make the  circle  bolingbroke or southwell reads  conjuro te    c  it thunders and lightens terribly  then the spirit riseth

 of the king  what shall of him become 
reading out of a paper


spirit

the duke yet lives that henry shall depose 
but him outlive  and die a violent death 
as the spirit speaks  southwell writes the answer


bolingbroke

 fates await the duke of suffolk 


spirit

by water shall he die  and take his end 


bolingbroke

 shall befall the duke of somerset 


spirit

let him shun castles 
safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
than where castles mounted stand 
have done  for more i hardly can endure 


bolingbroke

false fiend  avoid 
thunder and lightning  exit spirit

these oracles are hardly attain d 
and hardly understood 
the king is now in progress towards saint alban s
