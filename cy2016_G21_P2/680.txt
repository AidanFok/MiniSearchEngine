friar laurence

peace  ho  for shame  confusion cure lives not
in these confusions  heaven and yourself
had part in this fair maid  now heaven hath all 
and all the better is it for the maid 
your part in her you could not keep from death 
but heaven keeps his part in eternal life 
the most you sought was her promotion 
for  your heaven she should be advanced 
and weep ye now  seeing she is advanced
above the clouds  as high as heaven itself 
o  in this love  you love your child so ill 
that you run mad  seeing that she is well 
she not well married that lives married long 
but she best married that dies married young 
dry up your tears  and stick your rosemary
on this fair corse  and  as the custom is 
in all her best array bear her to church 
for though fond nature bids us an lament 
yet nature tears are reason merriment 


capulet

all things that we ordained festival 
turn from their office to black funeral 
our instruments to melancholy bells 
our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast 
our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change 
our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse 
and all things change them to the contrary 


friar laurence

sir  go you in  and  madam  go with him 
and go  sir paris  every one prepare
to follow this fair corse unto her grave 
the heavens do lour upon you for some ill 
move them no more by crossing their high will
