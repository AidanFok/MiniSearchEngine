this same should be the voice of friar john 
welcome from mantua  what says romeo 
or  if his mind be writ  give me his letter 


friar john

going to find a bare foot brother out
one of our order  to associate me 
here in this city visiting the sick 
and finding him  the searchers of the town 
suspecting that we both were in a house
where the infectious pestilence did reign 
seal up the doors  and would not let us forth 
so that my speed to mantua there was stay d 


friar laurence

who bare my letter  then  to romeo 


friar john

i could not send it here it is again 
nor get a messenger to bring it thee 
so fearful were they of infection 


friar laurence

unhappy fortune  by my brotherhood 
the letter was not nice but full of charge
of dear import  and the neglecting it
may do much danger  friar john  go hence 
get me an iron crow  and bring it straight
unto my cell 


friar john

brother  i go and bring it thee 
exit


friar laurence

now must i to the monument alone 
within three hours will fair juliet wake 
she will beshrew me much that romeo
hath had no notice of these accidents 
but i will write again to mantua 
and keep her at my cell till romeo come 
poor living corse  closed in a dead man tomb 
exit
