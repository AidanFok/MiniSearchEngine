enter paris  and his page bearing flowers and a torch


paris

give me thy torch  boy  hence  and stand aloof 
yet put it out  for i would not be seen 
under yond yew trees lay thee all along 
holding thine ear close to the hollow ground 
so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread 
being loose  unfirm  with digging up of graves 
but thou shalt hear it  whistle then to me 
as signal that thou hear something approach 
give me those flowers  do as i bid thee  go 


page

 aside   i am almost afraid to stand alone
here in the churchyard  yet i will adventure 
retires


paris

sweet flower  with flowers thy bridal bed i strew 
o woe  thy canopy is dust and stones 
which with sweet water nightly i will dew 
or  wanting that  with tears distill by moans 
the obsequies that i for thee will keep
nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep 
the page whistles
the boy gives warning something doth approach 
what cursed foot wanders this way to night 
to cross my obsequies and true love rite 
what with a torch  muffle me  night  awhile 
retires
enter romeo and balthasar  with a torch  mattock     c


romeo

give me that mattock and the wrenching iron 
hold  take this letter  early in the morning
see thou deliver it to my lord and father 
give me the light  upon thy life  i charge thee 
whate thou hear or seest  stand all aloof 
and do not interrupt me in my course 
why i descend into this bed of death 
is partly to behold my lady face 
but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
a precious ring  a ring that i must use
in dear employment  therefore hence  be gone 
but if thou  jealous  dost return to pry
in what i further shall intend to do 
by heaven  i will tear thee joint by joint
and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs 
the time and my intents are savage wild 
more fierce and more inexorable far
than empty tigers or the roaring sea 


balthasar

i will be gone  sir  and not trouble you 


romeo

so shalt thou show me friendship  take thou that 
live  and be prosperous  and farewell  good fellow 


balthasar

 aside   for all this same  i hide me hereabout 
his looks i fear  and his intents i doubt 
retires


romeo

thou detestable maw  thou womb of death 
gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth 
thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open 
and  in despite  i cram thee with more food 
opens the tomb


paris

this is that banish haughty montague 
that murder my love cousin  with which grief 
it is supposed  the fair creature died 
and here is come to do some villanous shame
to the dead bodies  i will apprehend him 
comes forward
stop thy unhallow toil  vile montague 
can vengeance be pursued further than death 
condemned villain  i do apprehend thee 
obey  and go with me  for thou must die 


romeo

i must indeed  and therefore came i hither 
good gentle youth  tempt not a desperate man 
fly hence  and leave me  think upon these gone 
let them affright thee  i beseech thee  youth 
put not another sin upon my head 
by urging me to fury  o  be gone 
by heaven  i love thee better than myself 
for i come hither arm against myself 
stay not  be gone  live  and hereafter say 
a madman mercy bade thee run away 


paris

i do defy thy conjurations 
and apprehend thee for a felon here 


romeo

wilt thou provoke me  then have at thee  boy 
they fight


page

o lord  they fight  i will go call the watch 
exit


paris

o  i am slain 
falls
if thou be merciful 
open the tomb  lay me with juliet 
dies


romeo

in faith  i will  let me peruse this face 
mercutio kinsman  noble county paris 
what said my man  when my betossed soul
did not attend him as we rode  i think
he told me paris should have married juliet 
said he not so  or did i dream it so 
or am i mad  hearing him talk of juliet 
to think it was so  o  give me thy hand 
one writ with me in sour misfortune book 
i bury thee in a triumphant grave 
a grave  o no  a lantern  slaughter youth 
for here lies juliet  and her beauty makes
this vault a feasting presence full of light 
death  lie thou there  by a dead man interr d 
laying paris in the tomb
how oft when men are at the point of death
have they been merry  which their keepers call
a lightning before death  o  how may i
call this a lightning  o my love  my wife 
death  that hath suck the honey of thy breath 
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty 
thou art not conquer d  beauty ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks 
and death pale flag is not advanced there 
tybalt  liest thou there in thy bloody sheet 
o  what more favour can i do to thee 
than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
to sunder his that was thine enemy 
forgive me  cousin  ah  dear juliet 
why art thou yet so fair  shall i believe
that unsubstantial death is amorous 
and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
thee here in dark to be his paramour 
for fear of that  i still will stay with thee 
and never from this palace of dim night
depart again  here  here will i remain
with worms that are thy chamber maids  o  here
will i set up my everlasting rest 
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world wearied flesh  eyes  look your last 
arms  take your last embrace  and  lips  o you
the doors of breath  seal with a righteous kiss
a dateless bargain to engrossing death 
come  bitter conduct  come  unsavoury guide 
thou desperate pilot  now at once run on
the dashing rocks thy sea sick weary bark 
here to my love 
drinks
o true apothecary 
thy drugs are quick  thus with a kiss i die 
dies
enter  at the other end of the churchyard  friar laurence  with a lantern  crow  and spade

friar laurence

o  much i fear some ill unlucky thing 


balthasar

i dreamt my master and another fought 
and that my master slew him 


friar laurence

that warns my old age to a sepulchre 
enter montague and others


prince

come  montague  for thou art early up 
to see thy son and heir more early down

grief of my son exile hath stopp her breath 
what further woe conspires against mine age 


prince

look  and thou shalt see 


montague

o thou untaught  what manners is in this 
to press before thy father to a grave 


prince

seal up the mouth of outrage for a while 
till we can clear these ambiguities 
and know their spring  their head  their
true descent 
and then will i be general of your woes 
and lead you even to death  meantime forbear 
and let mischance be slave to patience 
bring forth the parties of suspicion 


friar laurence

i am the greatest  able to do least 
yet most suspected  as the time and place
doth make against me of this direful murder 
and here i stand  both to impeach and purge
myself condemned and myself excused 


prince

then say at once what thou dost know in this 


friar laurence

i will be brief  for my short date of breath
is not so long as is a tedious tale 
romeo  there dead  was husband to that juliet 
and she  there dead  that romeo faithful wife 
i married them  and their stol marriage day
was tybalt dooms day  whose untimely death
banish the new made bridegroom from the city 
for whom  and not for tybalt  juliet pined 
you  to remove that siege of grief from her 
betroth and would have married her perforce
to county paris  then comes she to me 
and  with wild looks  bid me devise some mean
to rid her from this second marriage 
or in my cell there would she kill herself 
then gave i her  so tutor by my art 
a sleeping potion  which so took effect
as i intended  for it wrought on her
the form of death  meantime i writ to romeo 
that he should hither come as this dire night 
to help to take her from her borrow grave 
being the time the potion force should cease 
but he which bore my letter  friar john 
was stay by accident  and yesternight
return my letter back  then all alone
at the prefixed hour of her waking 
came i to take her from her kindred vault 
meaning to keep her closely at my cell 
till i conveniently could send to romeo 
but when i came  some minute ere the time
of her awaking  here untimely lay
the noble paris and true romeo dead 
she wakes  and i entreated her come forth 
and bear this work of heaven with patience 
but then a noise did scare me from the tomb 
and she  too desperate  would not go with me 
but  as it seems  did violence on herself 
all this i know  and to the marriage
her nurse is privy  and  if aught in this
miscarried by my fault  let my old life
be sacrificed  some hour before his time 
unto the rigour of severest law 


prince

we still have known thee for a holy man 
where romeo man  what can he say in this 


balthasar

i brought my master news of juliet death 
and then in post he came from mantua
to this same place  to this same monument 
this letter he early bid me give his father 
and threatened me with death  going in the vault 
i departed not and left him there 


prince

give me the letter  i will look on it 
where is the county page  that raised the watch 
sirrah  what made your master in this place 


page

he came with flowers to strew his lady grave 
and bid me stand aloof  and so i did 
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb 
and by and by my master drew on him 
and then i ran away to call the watch 


prince

this letter doth make good the friar words 
their course of love  the tidings of her death 
and here he writes that he did buy a poison
of a poor  pothecary  and therewithal
came to this vault to die  and lie with juliet 
where be these enemies  capulet  montague 
see  what a scourge is laid upon your hate 
that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love 
and i for winking at your discords too
have lost a brace of kinsmen  all are punish d 


capulet

o brother montague  give me thy hand 
this is my daughter jointure  for no more
can i demand 


montague

                  but i can give thee more 
for i will raise her statue in pure gold 
that while verona by that name is known 
there shall no figure at such rate be set
as that of true and faithful juliet 


capulet

as rich shall romeo by his lady lie 
poor sacrifices of our enmity 


prince

a glooming peace this morning with it brings 
the sun  for sorrow  will not show his head 
go hence  to have more talk of these sad things 
some shall be pardon d  and some punished 
for never was a story of more woe
than this of juliet and her romeo 
exeunt
