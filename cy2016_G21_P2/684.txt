where art thou  muse  that thou forget so long
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might 
spend thou thy fury on some worthless song 
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light 
return  forgetful muse  and straight redeem
in gentle numbers time so idly spent 
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
and gives thy pen both skill and argument 
rise  resty muse  my love sweet face survey 
if time have any wrinkle graven there 
if any  be a satire to decay 
and make time spoils despised every where 
  give my love fame faster than time wastes life 
  so thou prevent his scythe and crooked knife
