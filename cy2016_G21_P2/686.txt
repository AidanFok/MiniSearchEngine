sonnet cii

my love is strengthen d  though more weak in seeming 
i love not less  though less the show appear 
that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
the owner tongue doth publish every where 
our love was new and then but in the spring
when i was wont to greet it with my lays 
as philomel in summer front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days 
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night 
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight 
  therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue 
  because i would not dull you with my song
