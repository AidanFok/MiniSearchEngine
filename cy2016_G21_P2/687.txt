sonnet ciii

alack  what poverty my muse brings forth 
that having such a scope to show her pride 
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside 
o  blame me not  if i no more can write 
look in your glass  and there appears a face
that over goes my blunt invention quite 
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace 
were it not sinful then  striving to mend 
to mar the subject that before was well 
for to no other pass my verses tend
than of your graces and your gifts to tell 
  and more  much more  than in my verse can sit
  your own glass shows you when you look in it
