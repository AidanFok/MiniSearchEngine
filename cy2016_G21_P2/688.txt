to me  fair friend  you never can be old 
for as you were when first your eye i eyed 
such seems your beauty still  three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers  pride 
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn 
in process of the seasons have i seen 
three april perfumes in three hot junes burn d 
since first i saw you fresh  which yet are green 
ah  yet doth beauty  like a dial hand 
steal from his figure and no pace perceived 
so your sweet hue  which methinks still doth stand 
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived 
  for fear of which  hear this  thou age unbred 
  ere you were born was beauty summer dead
