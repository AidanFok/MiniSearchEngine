sonnet cix

o  never say that i was false of heart 
though absence seem my flame to qualify 
as easy might i from myself depart
as from my soul  which in thy breast doth lie 
that is my home of love  if i have ranged 
like him that travels i return again 
just to the time  not with the time exchanged 
so that myself bring water for my stain 
never believe  though in my nature reign 
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood 
that it could so preposterously be stain d 
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good 
  for nothing this wide universe i call 
  save thou  my rose  in it thou art my all
