queen margaret

believe me  lords  for flying at the brook 
i saw not better sport these seven years  day 
yet  by your leave  the wind was very high 
and  ten to one  old joan had not gone out 


king henry vi

but what a point  my lord  your falcon made 
and what a pitch she flew above the rest 
to see how god in all his creatures works 
yea  man and birds are fain of climbing high 


suffolk

no marvel  an it like your majesty 
my lord protector hawks do tower so well 
they know their master loves to be aloft 
and bears his thoughts above his falcon pitch 


gloucester

my lord   but a base ignoble mind
that mounts no higher than a bird can soar 


cardinal

i thought as much  he would be above the clouds

christendom  if thou hadst been born blind  thou
mightest as well have known all our names as thus to
name the several colours we do wear  sight may
distinguish of colours  but suddenly to nominate them
all  it is impossible  my lords  saint alban here
hath done a miracle  and would ye not think his
cunning to be great  that could restore this cripple
to his legs again 


simpcox

o master  that you could 


gloucester

my masters of saint alban s  have you not beadles in
your town  and things called whips

if you mean to save yourself from whipping  leap me
over this stool and run away

beadle  whip him till he leap over that same stool 


beadle

doublet quickly 


simpcox

alas  master  what shall i do  i am not able to stand 
after the beadle hath hit him once  he leaps over the stool and runs away  and they follow and cry   miracle 


king henry vi

o god  seest thou this  and bearest so long 


queen margaret

it made me laugh to see the villain run 


gloucester

follow the knave  and take this drab away 


wife

alas  sir  we did it for pure need 


gloucester

let them be whipped through every market town  till
they come to berwick  from whence they came 
exeunt wife  beadle  mayor     c


cardinal

duke humphrey has done a miracle to day 


suffolk

true  made the lame to leap and fly away 


gloucester

but you have done more miracles than i 
you made in a day  my lord  whole towns to fly 
enter buckingham


king henry vi

what tidings with our cousin buckingham 


buckingham

such as my heart doth tremble to unfold 
a sort of naughty persons  lewdly bent 
under the countenance and confederacy
of lady eleanor  the protector wife 
the ringleader and head of all this rout 
have practised dangerously against your state 
dealing with witches and with conjurers 
whom we have apprehended in the fact 
raising up wicked spirits from under ground 
demanding of king henry life and death 
and other of your highness  privy council 
as more at large your grace shall understand 


cardinal

 aside to gloucester   and so  my lord protector 
by this means
your lady is forthcoming yet at london 
this news  i think  hath turn your weapon edge 
 like  my lord  you will not keep your hour 


gloucester

ambitious churchman  leave to afflict my heart 
sorrow and grief have vanquish all my powers 
and  vanquish as i am  i yield to thee 
or to the meanest groom 


king henry vi

o god  what mischiefs work the wicked ones 
heaping confusion on their own heads thereby 


queen margaret

gloucester  see here the tainture of thy nest 
and look thyself be faultless  thou wert best 


gloucester

madam  for myself  to heaven i do appeal 
how i have loved my king and commonweal 
and  for my wife  i know not how it stands 
sorry i am to hear what i have heard 
noble she is  but if she have forgot
honour and virtue and conversed with such
as  like to pitch  defile nobility 
i banish her my bed and company
and give her as a prey to law and shame 
that hath dishonour gloucester honest name 


king henry vi

well  for this night we will repose us here 
to morrow toward london back again 
to look into this business thoroughly
and call these foul offenders to their answers
and poise the cause in justice  equal scales 
whose beam stands sure  whose rightful cause prevails 
flourish  exeunt
