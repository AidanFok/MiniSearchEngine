sonnet cl

o  from what power hast thou this powerful might
with insufficiency my heart to sway 
to make me give the lie to my true sight 
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day 
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill 
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantize of skill
that  in my mind  thy worst all best exceeds 
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate 
o  though i love what others do abhor 
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state 
  if thy unworthiness raised love in me 
  more worthy i to be beloved of thee
