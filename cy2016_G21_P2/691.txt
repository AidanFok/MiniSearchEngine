love is too young to know what conscience is 
yet who knows not conscience is born of love 
then  gentle cheater  urge not my amiss 
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove 
for  thou betraying me  i do betray
my nobler part to my gross body treason 
my soul doth tell my body that he may
triumph in love  flesh stays no father reason 
but  rising at thy name  doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize  proud of this pride 
he is contented thy poor drudge to be 
to stand in thy affairs  fall by thy side 
  no want of conscience hold it that i call
  her  love  for whose dear love i rise and fall
