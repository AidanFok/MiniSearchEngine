sonnet clii

in loving thee thou know i am forsworn 
but thou art twice forsworn  to me love swearing 
in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn 
in vowing new hate after new love bearing 
but why of two oaths  breach do i accuse thee 
when i break twenty  i am perjured most 
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and all my honest faith in thee is lost 
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness 
oaths of thy love  thy truth  thy constancy 
and  to enlighten thee  gave eyes to blindness 
or made them swear against the thing they see 
  for i have sworn thee fair  more perjured i 
  to swear against the truth so foul a lie
