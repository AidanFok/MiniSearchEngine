sonnet cliii

cupid laid by his brand  and fell asleep 
a maid of dian this advantage found 
and his love kindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valley fountain of that ground 
which borrow from this holy fire of love
a dateless lively heat  still to endure 
and grew a seething bath  which yet men prove
against strange maladies a sovereign cure 
but at my mistress  eye love brand new fired 
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast 
i  sick withal  the help of bath desired 
and thither hied  a sad distemper guest 
  but found no cure  the bath for my help lies
  where cupid got new fire my mistress  eyes
