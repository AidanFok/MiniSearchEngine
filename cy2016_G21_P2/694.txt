the little love god lying once asleep
laid by his side his heart inflaming brand 
whilst many nymphs that vow chaste life to keep
came tripping by  but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warm d 
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm d 
this brand she quenched in a cool well by 
which from love fire took heat perpetual 
growing a bath and healthful remedy
for men diseased  but i  my mistress  thrall 
  came there for cure  and this by that i prove 
  love fire heats water  water cools not love
