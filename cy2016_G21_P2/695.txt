let not my love be call idolatry 
nor my beloved as an idol show 
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one  of one  still such  and ever so 
kind is my love to day  to morrow kind 
still constant in a wondrous excellence 
therefore my verse to constancy confined 
one thing expressing  leaves out difference 
 fair  kind and true  is all my argument 
 fair  kind  and true  varying to other words 
and in this change is my invention spent 
three themes in one  which wondrous scope affords 
   fair  kind  and true  have often lived alone 
  which three till now never kept seat in one
