when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights 
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights 
then  in the blazon of sweet beauty best 
of hand  of foot  of lip  of eye  of brow 
i see their antique pen would have express 
even such a beauty as you master now 
so all their praises are but prophecies
of this our time  all you prefiguring 
and  for they look but with divining eyes 
they had not skill enough your worth to sing 
  for we  which now behold these present days 
  had eyes to wonder  but lack tongues to praise
