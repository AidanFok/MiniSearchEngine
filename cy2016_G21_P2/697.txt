sonnet cvii
sonnet cvii

not mine own fears  nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world dreaming on things to come 
can yet the lease of my true love control 
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom 
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
and the sad augurs mock their own presage 
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age 
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh  and death to me subscribes 
since  spite of him  i live in this poor rhyme 
while he insults o dull and speechless tribes 
  and thou in this shalt find thy monument 
  when tyrants  crests and tombs of brass are spent
