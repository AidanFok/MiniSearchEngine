sonnet cviii

what in the brain that ink may character
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit 
what new to speak  what new to register 
that may express my love or thy dear merit 
nothing  sweet boy  but yet  like prayers divine 
i must  each day say o the very same 
counting no old thing old  thou mine  i thine 
even as when first i hallow thy fair name 
so that eternal love in love fresh case
weighs not the dust and injury of age 
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place 
but makes antiquity for aye his page 
  finding the first conceit of love there bred
  where time and outward form would show it dead
