alas   true i have gone here and there
and made myself a motley to the view 
gored mine own thoughts  sold cheap what is most dear 
made old offences of affections new 
most true it is that i have look on truth
askance and strangely  but  by all above 
these blenches gave my heart another youth 
and worse essays proved thee my best of love 
now all is done  have what shall have no end 
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof  to try an older friend 
a god in love  to whom i am confined 
  then give me welcome  next my heaven the best 
  even to thy pure and most most loving breast
