mortimer

these promises are fair  the parties sure 
and our induction full of prosperous hope 


hotspur

lord mortimer  and cousin glendower 
will you sit down 
and uncle worcester  a plague upon it 
i have forgot the map 


glendower

no  here it is 
sit  cousin percy  sit  good cousin hotspur 
for by that name as oft as lancaster
doth speak of you  his cheek looks pale and with
a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven 


hotspur

and you in hell  as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of 


glendower

i cannot blame him  at my nativity
the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes 
of burning cressets  and at my birth
the frame and huge foundation of the earth
shaked like a coward 


hotspur

why  so it would have done at the same season  if
your mother cat had but kittened  though yourself
had never been born 


glendower

i say the earth did shake when i was born 


hotspur

and i say the earth was not of my mind 
if you suppose as fearing you it shook 


glendower

the heavens were all on fire  the earth did tremble 


hotspur

o  then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire 
and not in fear of your nativity 
diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
in strange eruptions  oft the teeming earth
is with a kind of colic pinch and vex 
by the imprisoning of unruly wind
within her womb  which  for enlargement striving 
shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
steeples and moss grown towers  at your birth
our grandam earth  having this distemperature 
in passion shook 


glendower

                  cousin  of many men
i do not bear these crossings  give me leave
to tell you once again that at my birth
the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes 
the goats ran from the mountains  and the herds
were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields 
these signs have mark me extraordinary 
and all the courses of my life do show
i am not in the roll of common men 
where is he living  clipp in with the sea
that chides the banks of england  scotland  wales 
which calls me pupil  or hath read to me 
and bring him out that is but woman son
can trace me in the tedious ways of art
and hold me pace in deep experiments 


hotspur

i think there no man speaks better welsh 
i to dinner 


mortimer

peace  cousin percy  you will make him mad 


glendower

i can call spirits from the vasty deep 


hotspur

why  so can i  or so can any man 
but will they come when you do call for them 


glendower

why  i can teach you  cousin  to command
the devil 


hotspur

and i can teach thee  coz  to shame the devil
by telling truth  tell truth and shame the devil 
if thou have power to raise him  bring him hither 
and i be sworn i have power to shame him hence 
o  while you live  tell truth and shame the devil 


mortimer

come  come  no more of this unprofitable chat 


glendower

three times hath henry bolingbroke made head
against my power  thrice from the banks of wye
and sandy bottom severn have i sent him
bootless home and weather beaten back 


hotspur

home without boots  and in foul weather too 
how  he agues  in the devil name 


glendower

come  here the map  shall we divide our right
according to our threefold order ta en 


mortimer

the archdeacon hath divided it
into three limits very equally 
england  from trent and severn hitherto 
by south and east is to my part assign d 
all westward  wales beyond the severn shore 
and all the fertile land within that bound 
to owen glendower  and  dear coz  to you
the remnant northward  lying off from trent 
and our indentures tripartite are drawn 
which being sealed interchangeably 
a business that this night may execute 
to morrow  cousin percy  you and i
and my good lord of worcester will set forth
to meet your father and the scottish power 
as is appointed us  at shrewsbury 
my father glendower is not ready yet 
not shall we need his help these fourteen days 
within that space you may have drawn together
your tenants  friends and neighbouring gentlemen 


glendower

a shorter time shall send me to you  lords 
and in my conduct shall your ladies come 
from whom you now must steal and take no leave 
for there will be a world of water shed
upon the parting of your wives and you 


hotspur

methinks my moiety  north from burton here 
in quantity equals not one of yours 
see how this river comes me cranking in 
and cuts me from the best of all my land
a huge half moon  a monstrous cantle out 
i have the current in this place damm up 
and here the smug and silver trent shall run
in a new channel  fair and evenly 
it shall not wind with such a deep indent 
to rob me of so rich a bottom here 


glendower

not wind  it shall  it must  you see it doth 


mortimer

yea  but
mark how he bears his course  and runs me up
with like advantage on the other side 
gelding the opposed continent as much
as on the other side it takes from you 


earl of worcester

yea  but a little charge will trench him here
and on this north side win this cape of land 
and then he runs straight and even 


hotspur

i have it so  a little charge will do it 


glendower

i not have it alter d 


hotspur

will not you 


glendower

no  nor you shall not 


hotspur

who shall say me nay 


glendower

why  that will i 


hotspur

let me not understand you  then  speak it in welsh 


glendower

i can speak english  lord  as well as you 
for i was train up in the english court 
where  being but young  i framed to the harp
many an english ditty lovely well
and gave the tongue a helpful ornament 
a virtue that was never seen in you 


hotspur

marry 
and i am glad of it with all my heart 
i had rather be a kitten and cry mew
than one of these same metre ballad mongers 
i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn d 
or a dry wheel grate on the axle tree 
and that would set my teeth nothing on edge 
nothing so much as mincing poetry 
 like the forced gait of a shuffling nag 


glendower

come  you shall have trent turn d 


hotspur

i do not care  i give thrice so much land
to any well deserving friend 
but in the way of bargain  mark ye me 
i cavil on the ninth part of a hair 
are the indentures drawn  shall we be gone 


glendower

the moon shines fair  you may away by night 
i haste the writer and withal
break with your wives of your departure hence 
i am afraid my daughter will run mad 
so much she doteth on her mortimer 
exit glendower


mortimer

fie  cousin percy  how you cross my father 


hotspur

i cannot choose  sometime he angers me
with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant 
of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies 
and of a dragon and a finless fish 
a clip wing griffin and a moulten raven 
a couching lion and a ramping cat 
and such a deal of skimble skamble stuff
as puts me from my faith  i tell you what 
he held me last night at least nine hours
in reckoning up the several devils  names
that were his lackeys  i cried  hum  and  well  go to 
but mark him not a word  o  he is as tedious
as a tired horse  a railing wife 
worse than a smoky house  i had rather live
with cheese and garlic in a windmill  far 
than feed on cates and have him talk to me
in any summer house in christendom 


mortimer

in faith  he is a worthy gentleman 
exceedingly well read  and profited
in strange concealments  valiant as a lion
and as wondrous affable and as bountiful
as mines of india  shall i tell you  cousin 
he holds your temper in a high respect
and curbs himself even of his natural scope
when you come  his humour  faith  he does 
i warrant you  that man is not alive
might so have tempted him as you have done 
without the taste of danger and reproof 
but do not use it oft  let me entreat you 


earl of worcester

in faith  my lord  you are too wilful blame 
and since your coming hither have done enough
to put him quite beside his patience 
you must needs learn  lord  to amend this fault 
though sometimes it show greatness  courage  blood 
and that the dearest grace it renders you 
yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage 
defect of manners  want of government 
pride  haughtiness  opinion and disdain 
the least of which haunting a nobleman
loseth men hearts and leaves behind a stain
upon the beauty of all parts besides 
beguiling them of commendation 


hotspur

well  i am school d  good manners be your speed 
here come our wives  and let us take our leave 
re enter glendower with the ladies


mortimer

this is the deadly spite that angers me 
my wife can speak no english  i no welsh 


glendower

my daughter weeps  she will not part with you 
she be a soldier too  she to the wars 


mortimer

good father  tell her that she and my aunt percy
shall follow in your conduct speedily 
glendower speaks to her in welsh  and she answers him in the same


glendower

she is desperate here  a peevish self wind harlotry 
one that no persuasion can do good upon 
the lady speaks in welsh


mortimer

i understand thy looks  that pretty welsh
which thou pour down from these swelling heavens
i am too perfect in  and  but for shame 
in such a parley should i answer thee 
the lady speaks again in welsh
i understand thy kisses and thou mine 
and that a feeling disputation 
but i will never be a truant  love 
till i have learned thy language  for thy tongue
makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn d 
sung by a fair queen in a summer bower 
with ravishing division  to her lute 


glendower

nay  if you melt  then will she run mad 
the lady speaks again in welsh


mortimer

o  i am ignorance itself in this 


glendower

she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
and rest your gentle head upon her lap 
and she will sing the song that pleaseth you
and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep 
charming your blood with pleasing heaviness 
making such difference  wake and sleep
as is the difference betwixt day and night
the hour before the heavenly harness team
begins his golden progress in the east 


mortimer

with all my heart i sit and hear her sing 
by that time will our book  i think  be drawn


glendower

do so 
and those musicians that shall play to you
hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence 
and straight they shall be here  sit  and attend 


hotspur

come  kate  thou art perfect in lying down  come 
quick  quick  that i may lay my head in thy lap 


lady percy

go  ye giddy goose 
the music plays


hotspur

now i perceive the devil understands welsh 
and  no marvel he is so humorous 
by lady  he is a good musician 


lady percy

then should you be nothing but musical for you are
altogether governed by humours  lie still  ye thief 
and hear the lady sing in welsh 


hotspur

i had rather hear lady  my brach  howl in irish 


lady percy

wouldst thou have thy head broken 


hotspur

no 


lady percy

then be still 


hotspur

neither a woman fault 


lady percy

now god help thee 


hotspur

to the welsh lady bed 


lady percy

what that 


hotspur

peace  she sings 
here the lady sings a welsh song


hotspur

come  kate  i have your song too 


lady percy

not mine  in good sooth 


hotspur

not yours  in good sooth  heart  you swear like a
comfit maker wife   you  in good sooth  and
 true as i live  and  god shall mend me  and
 sure as day 
and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths 
as if thou never walk further than finsbury 
swear me  kate  like a lady as thou art 
a good mouth filling oath  and leave  sooth 
and such protest of pepper gingerbread 
to velvet guards and sunday citizens 
come  sing 


lady percy

i will not sing 


hotspur

 the next way to turn tailor  or be red breast
teacher  an the indentures be drawn  i away
within these two hours  and so  come in when ye will 
exit


glendower

come  come  lord mortimer  you are as slow
as hot lord percy is on fire to go 
by this our book is drawn  we but seal 
and then to horse immediately 


mortimer

with all my heart 
exeunt
