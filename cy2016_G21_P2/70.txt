scene ii  london  york garden 


enter york  salisbury  and warwick


york

now  my good lords of salisbury and warwick 
our simple supper ended  give me leave
in this close walk to satisfy myself 
in craving your opinion of my title 
which is infallible  to england crown 


salisbury

my lord  i long to hear it at full 


warwick

sweet york  begin  and if thy claim be good 
the nevils are thy subjects to command 


york

then thus 
edward the third  my lords  had seven sons 
the first  edward the black prince  prince of wales 
the second  william of hatfield  and the third 
lionel duke of clarence  next to whom
was john of gaunt  the duke of lancaster 
the fifth was edmund langley  duke of york 
the sixth was thomas of woodstock  duke of gloucester 
william of windsor was the seventh and last 
edward the black prince died before his father
and left behind him richard  his only son 
who after edward the third death reign as king 
till henry bolingbroke  duke of lancaster 
the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt 
crown by the name of henry the fourth 
seized on the realm  deposed the rightful king 
sent his poor queen to france  from whence she came 
and him to pomfret  where  as all you know 
harmless richard was murder traitorously 


warwick

father  the duke hath told the truth 
thus got the house of lancaster the crown 


york

which now they hold by force and not by right 
for richard  the first son heir  being dead 
the issue of the next son should have reign d 


salisbury

but william of hatfield died without an heir 


york

the third son  duke of clarence  from whose line
i claimed the crown  had issue  philippe  a daughter 
who married edmund mortimer  earl of march 
edmund had issue  roger earl of march 
roger had issue  edmund  anne and eleanor 


salisbury

this edmund  in the reign of bolingbroke 
as i have read  laid claim unto the crown 
and  but for owen glendower  had been king 
who kept him in captivity till he died 
but to the rest 


york

       his eldest sister  anne 
my mother  being heir unto the crown
married richard earl of cambridge  who was son
to edmund langley  edward the third fifth son 
by her i claim the kingdom  she was heir
to roger earl of march  who was the son
of edmund mortimer  who married philippe 
sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence 
so  if the issue of the elder son
succeed before the younger  i am king 


warwick

what plain proceeding is more plain than this 
henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt 
the fourth son  york claims it from the third 
till lionel issue fails  his should not reign 
it fails not yet  but flourishes in thee
and in thy sons  fair slips of such a stock 
then  father salisbury  kneel we together 
and in this private plot be we the first
that shall salute our rightful sovereign
with honour of his birthright to the crown 


both

long live our sovereign richard  england king 


york

we thank you  lords  but i am not your king
till i be crown and that my sword be stain 
with heart blood of the house of lancaster 
and that not suddenly to be perform d 
but with advice and silent secrecy 
do you as i do in these dangerous days 
wink at the duke of suffolk insolence 
at beaufort pride  at somerset ambition 
at buckingham and all the crew of them 
till they have snared the shepherd of the flock 
that virtuous prince  the good duke humphrey 
 that they seek  and they in seeking that
shall find their deaths  if york can prophesy 


salisbury

my lord  break we off  we know your mind at full 


warwick

my heart assures me that the earl of warwick
shall one day make the duke of york a king 


york

and  nevil  this i do assure myself 
richard shall live to make the earl of warwick
the greatest man in england but the king
