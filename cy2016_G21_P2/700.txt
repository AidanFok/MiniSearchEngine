sonnet cxi

o  for my sake do you with fortune chide 
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds 
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds 
thence comes it that my name receives a brand 
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in  like the dyer hand 
pity me then and wish i were renew d 
whilst  like a willing patient  i will drink
potions of eisel  my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think 
nor double penance  to correct correction 
  pity me then  dear friend  and i assure ye
  even that your pity is enough to cure me
