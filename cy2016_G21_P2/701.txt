sonnet cxii

your love and pity doth the impression fill
which vulgar scandal stamp upon my brow 
for what care i who calls me well or ill 
so you o er green my bad  my good allow 
you are my all the world  and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue 
none else to me  nor i to none alive 
that my steel sense or changes right or wrong 
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others  voices  that my adder sense
to critic and to flatterer stopped are 
mark how with my neglect i do dispense 
  you are so strongly in my purpose bred
  that all the world besides methinks are dead
