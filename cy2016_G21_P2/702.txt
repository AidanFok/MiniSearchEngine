sonnet cxiii

since i left you  mine eye is in my mind 
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function and is partly blind 
seems seeing  but effectually is out 
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird of flower  or shape  which it doth latch 
of his quick objects hath the mind no part 
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch 
for if it see the rudest or gentlest sight 
the most sweet favour or deformed creature 
the mountain or the sea  the day or night 
the crow or dove  it shapes them to your feature 
  incapable of more  replete with you 
  my most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue
