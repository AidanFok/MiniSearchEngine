or whether doth my mind  being crown with you 
drink up the monarch plague  this flattery 
or whether shall i say  mine eye saith true 
and that your love taught it this alchemy 
to make of monsters and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble 
creating every bad a perfect best 
as fast as objects to his beams assemble 
o the first   flattery in my seeing 
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up 
mine eye well knows what with his gust is  greeing 
and to his palate doth prepare the cup 
  if it be poison d   the lesser sin
  that mine eye loves it and doth first begin
