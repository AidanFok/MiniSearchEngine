sonnet cxix

what potions have i drunk of siren tears 
distill from limbecks foul as hell within 
applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears 
still losing when i saw myself to win 
what wretched errors hath my heart committed 
whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never 
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
in the distraction of this madding fever 
o benefit of ill  now i find true
that better is by evil still made better 
and ruin love  when it is built anew 
grows fairer than at first  more strong  far greater 
  so i return rebuked to my content
  and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent
