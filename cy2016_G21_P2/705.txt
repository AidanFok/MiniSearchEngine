sonnet cxl

be wise as thou art cruel  do not press
my tongue tied patience with too much disdain 
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pity wanting pain 
if i might teach thee wit  better it were 
though not to love  yet  love  to tell me so 
as testy sick men  when their deaths be near 
no news but health from their physicians know 
for if i should despair  i should grow mad 
and in my madness might speak ill of thee 
now this ill wresting world is grown so bad 
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be 
  that i may not be so  nor thou belied 
  bear thine eyes straight  though thy proud heart go wide
