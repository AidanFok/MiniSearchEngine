sonnet cxli

in faith  i do not love thee with mine eyes 
for they in thee a thousand errors note 
but  my heart that loves what they despise 
who in despite of view is pleased to dote 
nor are mine ears with thy tongue tune delighted 
nor tender feeling  to base touches prone 
nor taste  nor smell  desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone 
but my five wits nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee 
who leaves unsway the likeness of a man 
thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be 
  only my plague thus far i count my gain 
  that she that makes me sin awards me pain
