sonnet cxliii

lo  as a careful housewife runs to catch
one of her feather creatures broke away 
sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay 
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase 
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
to follow that which flies before her face 
not prizing her poor infant discontent 
so runn thou after that which flies from thee 
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind 
but if thou catch thy hope  turn back to me 
and play the mother part  kiss me  be kind 
  so will i pray that thou mayst have thy  will 
  if thou turn back  and my loud crying still
