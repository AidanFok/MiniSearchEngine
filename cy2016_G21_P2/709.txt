sonnet cxliv

two loves i have of comfort and despair 
which like two spirits do suggest me still 
the better angel is a man right fair 
the worser spirit a woman colour ill 
to win me soon to hell  my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side 
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil 
wooing his purity with her foul pride 
and whether that my angel be turn fiend
suspect i may  but not directly tell 
but being both from me  both to each friend 
i guess one angel in another hell 
  yet this shall i ne know  but live in doubt 
  till my bad angel fire my good one out
