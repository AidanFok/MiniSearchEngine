sonnet cxlix

canst thou  o cruel  say i love thee not 
when i against myself with thee partake 
do i not think on thee  when i forgot
am of myself  all tyrant  for thy sake 
who hateth thee that i do call my friend 
on whom frown thou that i do fawn upon 
nay  if thou lour on me  do i not spend
revenge upon myself with present moan 
what merit do i in myself respect 
that is so proud thy service to despise 
when all my best doth worship thy defect 
commanded by the motion of thine eyes 
  but  love  hate on  for now i know thy mind 
  those that can see thou lovest  and i am blind
