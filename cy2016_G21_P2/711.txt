sonnet cxlv

those lips that love own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said  hate 
to me that languish for her sake 
but when she saw my woeful state 
straight in her heart did mercy come 
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
was used in giving gentle doom 
and taught it thus anew to greet 
 hate  she alter with an end 
that follow it as gentle day
doth follow night  who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away 
   hate  from hate away she threw 
  and saved my life  saying  you
