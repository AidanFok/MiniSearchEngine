sonnet cxlvi

poor soul  the centre of my sinful earth 
            these rebel powers that thee array 
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth 
painting thy outward walls so costly gay 
why so large cost  having so short a lease 
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend 
shall worms  inheritors of this excess 
eat up thy charge  is this thy body end 
then soul  live thou upon thy servant loss 
and let that pine to aggravate thy store 
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross 
within be fed  without be rich no more 
  so shalt thou feed on death  that feeds on men 
  and death once dead  there no more dying then
