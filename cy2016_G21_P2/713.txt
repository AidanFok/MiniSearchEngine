sonnet cxlvii

my love is as a fever  longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease 
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill 
the uncertain sickly appetite to please 
my reason  the physician to my love 
angry that his prescriptions are not kept 
hath left me  and i desperate now approve
desire is death  which physic did except 
past cure i am  now reason is past care 
and frantic mad with evermore unrest 
my thoughts and my discourse as madmen are 
at random from the truth vainly express d 
  for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright 
  who art as black as hell  as dark as night
