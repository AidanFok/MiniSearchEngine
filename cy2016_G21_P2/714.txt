sonnet cxlviii

o me  what eyes hath love put in my head 
which have no correspondence with true sight 
or  if they have  where is my judgment fled 
that censures falsely what they see aright 
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote 
what means the world to say it is not so 
if it be not  then love doth well denote
love eye is not so true as all men no 
how can it  o  how can love eye be true 
that is so vex with watching and with tears 
no marvel then  though i mistake my view 
the sun itself sees not till heaven clears 
  o cunning love  with tears thou keep me blind 
  lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find
