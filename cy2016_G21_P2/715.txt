sonnet cxv

those lines that i before have writ do lie 
even those that said i could not love you dearer 
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer 
but reckoning time  whose million accidents
creep in  vows and change decrees of kings 
tan sacred beauty  blunt the sharp intents 
divert strong minds to the course of altering things 
alas  why  fearing of time tyranny 
might i not then say  i love you best 
when i was certain o incertainty 
crowning the present  doubting of the rest 
  love is a babe  then might i not say so 
  to give full growth to that which still doth grow
