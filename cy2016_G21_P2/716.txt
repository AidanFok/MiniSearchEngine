sonnet cxvi

let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments  love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds 
or bends with the remover to remove 
o no  it is an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken 
it is the star to every wandering bark 
whose worth unknown  although his height be taken 
love not time fool  though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickle compass come 
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks 
but bears it out even to the edge of doom 
  if this be error and upon me proved 
  i never writ  nor no man ever loved
