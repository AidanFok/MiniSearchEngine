sonnet cxvii

accuse me thus  that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay 
forgot upon your dearest love to call 
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day 
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
and given to time your own dear purchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight 
book both my wilfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise accumulate 
bring me within the level of your frown 
but shoot not at me in your waken hate 
  since my appeal says i did strive to prove
  the constancy and virtue of your love
