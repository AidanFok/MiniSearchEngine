sonnet cxviii

like as  to make our appetites more keen 
with eager compounds we our palate urge 
as  to prevent our maladies unseen 
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge 
even so  being tuff of your ne er cloying sweetness 
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding
and  sick of welfare  found a kind of meetness
to be diseased ere that there was true needing 
thus policy in love  to anticipate
the ills that were not  grew to faults assured
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which  rank of goodness  would by ill be cured 
  but thence i learn  and find the lesson true 
  drugs poison him that so fell sick of you
