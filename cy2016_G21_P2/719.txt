that you were once unkind befriends me now 
and for that sorrow which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow 
unless my nerves were brass or hammer steel 
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours  you pass a hell of time 
and i  a tyrant  have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime 
o  that our night of woe might have remember 
my deepest sense  how hard true sorrow hits 
and soon to you  as you to me  then tender 
the humble slave which wounded bosoms fits 
  but that your trespass now becomes a fee 
  mine ransoms yours  and yours must ransom me
