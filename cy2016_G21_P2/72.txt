scene iv  a street 


enter gloucester and his servingmen  in mourning cloaks


gloucester

thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud 
and after summer evermore succeeds
barren winter  with his wrathful nipping cold 
so cares and joys abound  as seasons fleet 
sirs  what o clock 


servants

ten  my lord 


gloucester

ten is the hour that was appointed me
to watch the coming of my punish duchess 
uneath may she endure the flinty streets 
to tread them with her tender feeling feet 
sweet nell  ill can thy noble mind abrook
the abject people gazing on thy face 
with envious looks  laughing at thy shame 
that erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels
when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets 
but  soft  i think she comes  and i prepare
my tear stain eyes to see her miseries 
enter the duchess in a white sheet  and a taper  burning in her hand  with stanley  the sheriff  and officers


servant

so please your grace  we take her from the sheriff 


gloucester

no  stir not  for your lives  let her pass by 


duchess

come you  my lord  to see my open shame 
now thou dost penance too  look how they gaze 
see how the giddy multitude do point 
and nod their heads  and throw their eyes on thee 
ah  gloucester  hide thee from their hateful looks 
and  in thy closet pent up  rue my shame 
and ban thine enemies  both mine and thine 


gloucester

be patient  gentle nell  forget this grief 


duchess

ah  gloucester  teach me to forget myself 
for whilst i think i am thy married wife
and thou a prince  protector of this land 
methinks i should not thus be led along 
mail up in shame  with papers on my back 
and followed with a rabble that rejoice
to see my tears and hear my deep fet groans 
the ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet 
and when i start  the envious people laugh
and bid me be advised how i tread 
ah  humphrey  can i bear this shameful yoke 
trow thou that e i look upon the world 
or count them happy that enjoy the sun 
no  dark shall be my light and night my day 
to think upon my pomp shall be my hell 
sometime i say  i am duke humphrey wife 
and he a prince and ruler of the land 
yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
as he stood by whilst i  his forlorn duchess 
was made a wonder and a pointing stock
to every idle rascal follower 
but be thou mild and blush not at my shame 
nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
hang over thee  as  sure  it shortly will 
for suffolk  he that can do all in all
with her that hateth thee and hates us all 
and york and impious beaufort  that false priest 
have all limed bushes to betray thy wings 
and  fly thou how thou canst  they tangle thee 
but fear not thou  until thy foot be snared 
nor never seek prevention of thy foes 


gloucester

ah  nell  forbear  thou aimest all awry 
i must offend before i be attainted 
and had i twenty times so many foes 
and each of them had twenty times their power 
all these could not procure me any scathe 
so long as i am loyal  true and crimeless 
wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach 
why  yet thy scandal were not wiped away
but i in danger for the breach of law 
thy greatest help is quiet  gentle nell 
i pray thee  sort thy heart to patience 
these few days  wonder will be quickly worn 
enter a herald


herald

holden at bury the first of this next month

there to be used according to your state 


duchess

and shall i then be used reproachfully

according to that state you shall be used 


duchess

and show itself  attire me how i can
