sonnet cxxi

 better to be vile than vile esteem d 
when not to be receives reproach of being 
and the just pleasure lost which is so deem 
not by our feeling but by others  seeing 
for why should others false adulterate eyes
give salutation to my sportive blood 
or on my frailties why are frailer spies 
which in their wills count bad what i think good 
no  i am that i am  and they that level
at my abuses reckon up their own 
i may be straight  though they themselves be bevel 
by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown 
  unless this general evil they maintain 
  all men are bad  and in their badness reign
