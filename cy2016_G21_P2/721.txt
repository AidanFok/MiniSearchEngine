sonnet cxxii

thy gift  thy tables  are within my brain
full character with lasting memory 
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date  even to eternity 
or at the least  so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist 
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee  thy record never can be miss d 
that poor retention could not so much hold 
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score 
therefore to give them from me was i bold 
to trust those tables that receive thee more 
  to keep an adjunct to remember thee
  were to import forgetfulness in me
