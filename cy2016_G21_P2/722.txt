sonnet cxxiii

no  time  thou shalt not boast that i do change 
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel  nothing strange 
they are but dressings of a former sight 
our dates are brief  and therefore we admire
what thou dost foist upon us that is old 
and rather make them born to our desire
than think that we before have heard them told 
thy registers and thee i both defy 
not wondering at the present nor the past 
for thy records and what we see doth lie 
made more or less by thy continual haste 
  this i do vow and this shall ever be 
  i will be true  despite thy scythe and thee
