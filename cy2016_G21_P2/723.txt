sonnet cxxiv

if my dear love were but the child of state 
it might for fortune bastard be unfather d 
as subject to time love or to time hate 
weeds among weeds  or flowers with flowers gather d 
no  it was builded far from accident 
it suffers not in smiling pomp  nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent 
whereto the inviting time our fashion calls 
it fears not policy  that heretic 
which works on leases of short number hours 
but all alone stands hugely politic 
that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers 
  to this i witness call the fools of time 
  which die for goodness  who have lived for crime
