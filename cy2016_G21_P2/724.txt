sonnet cxxix

the expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action  and till action  lust
is perjured  murderous  bloody  full of blame 
savage  extreme  rude  cruel  not to trust 
enjoy no sooner but despised straight 
past reason hunted  and no sooner had
past reason hated  as a swallow bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad 
mad in pursuit and in possession so 
had  having  and in quest to have  extreme 
a bliss in proof  and proved  a very woe 
before  a joy proposed  behind  a dream 
  all this the world well knows  yet none knows well
  to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
