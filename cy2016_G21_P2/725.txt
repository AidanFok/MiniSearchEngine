were  aught to me i bore the canopy 
with my extern the outward honouring 
or laid great bases for eternity 
which prove more short than waste or ruining 
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
lose all  and more  by paying too much rent 
for compound sweet forgoing simple savour 
pitiful thrivers  in their gazing spent 
no  let me be obsequious in thy heart 
and take thou my oblation  poor but free 
which is not mix with seconds  knows no art 
but mutual render  only me for thee 
  hence  thou suborn informer  a true soul
  when most impeach stands least in thy control
