sonnet cxxvi

o thou  my lovely boy  who in thy power
dost hold time fickle glass  his sickle  hour 
who hast by waning grown  and therein show 
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow st 
if nature  sovereign mistress over wrack 
as thou goest onwards  still will pluck thee back 
she keeps thee to this purpose  that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill 
yet fear her  o thou minion of her pleasure 
she may detain  but not still keep  her treasure 
  her audit  though delay d  answer must be 
  and her quietus is to render thee
