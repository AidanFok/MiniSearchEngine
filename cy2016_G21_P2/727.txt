sonnet cxxvii

in the old age black was not counted fair 
or if it were  it bore not beauty name 
but now is black beauty successive heir 
and beauty slander with a bastard shame 
for since each hand hath put on nature power 
fairing the foul with art false borrow face 
sweet beauty hath no name  no holy bower 
but is profaned  if not lives in disgrace 
therefore my mistress  brows are raven black 
her eyes so suited  and they mourners seem
at such who  not born fair  no beauty lack 
slandering creation with a false esteem 
  yet so they mourn  becoming of their woe 
  that every tongue says beauty should look so
