sonnet cxxviii

how oft  when thou  my music  music play st 
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers  when thou gently sway 
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds 
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand 
whilst my poor lips  which should that harvest reap 
at the wood boldness by thee blushing stand 
to be so tickled  they would change their state
and situation with those dancing chips 
o whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait 
making dead wood more blest than living lips 
  since saucy jacks so happy are in this 
  give them thy fingers  me thy lips to kiss
