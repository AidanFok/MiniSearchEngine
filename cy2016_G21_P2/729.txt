sonnet cxxx

my mistress  eyes are nothing like the sun 
coral is far more red than her lips  red 
if snow be white  why then her breasts are dun 
if hairs be wires  black wires grow on her head 
i have seen roses damask d  red and white 
but no such roses see i in her cheeks 
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks 
i love to hear her speak  yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound 
i grant i never saw a goddess go 
my mistress  when she walks  treads on the ground 
  and yet  by heaven  i think my love as rare
  as any she belied with false compare
