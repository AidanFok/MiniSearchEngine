king henry vi

i muse my lord of gloucester is not come 
 not his wont to be the hindmost man 
whate occasion keeps him from us now 


queen margaret

can you not see  or will ye not observe
the strangeness of his alter countenance 
with what a majesty he bears himself 
how insolent of late he is become 
how proud  how peremptory  and unlike himself 
we know the time since he was mild and affable 
and if we did but glance a far off look 
immediately he was upon his knee 
that all the court admired him for submission 
but meet him now  and  be it in the morn 
when every one will give the time of day 
he knits his brow and shows an angry eye 
and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee 
disdaining duty that to us belongs 
small curs are not regarded when they grin 
but great men tremble when the lion roars 
and humphrey is no little man in england 
first note that he is near you in descent 
and should you fall  he as the next will mount 
me seemeth then it is no policy 
respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
and his advantage following your decease 
that he should come about your royal person
or be admitted to your highness  council 
by flattery hath he won the commons  hearts 
and when he please to make commotion 
 to be fear they all will follow him 
now  the spring  and weeds are shallow rooted 
suffer them now  and they o the garden
and choke the herbs for want of husbandry 
the reverent care i bear unto my lord
made me collect these dangers in the duke 
if it be fond  call it a woman fear 
which fear if better reasons can supplant 
i will subscribe and say i wrong the duke 
my lord of suffolk  buckingham  and york 
reprove my allegation  if you can 
or else conclude my words effectual 


suffolk

well hath your highness seen into this duke 
and  had i first been put to speak my mind 
i think i should have told your grace tale 
the duchess  by his subornation 
upon my life  began her devilish practises 
or  if he were not privy to those faults 
yet  by reputing of his high descent 
as next the king he was successive heir 
and such high vaunts of his nobility 
did instigate the bedlam brain sick duchess
by wicked means to frame our sovereign fall 
smooth runs the water where the brook is deep 
and in his simple show he harbours treason 
the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb 
no  no  my sovereign  gloucester is a man
unsounded yet and full of deep deceit 


cardinal

did he not  contrary to form of law 
devise strange deaths for small offences done 


york

and did he not  in his protectorship 
levy great sums of money through the realm
for soldiers  pay in france  and never sent it 
by means whereof the towns each day revolted 


buckingham

tut  these are petty faults to faults unknown 
which time will bring to light in smooth
duke humphrey 


king henry vi

my lords  at once  the care you have of us 
to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot 
is worthy praise  but  shall i speak my conscience 
our kinsman gloucester is as innocent
from meaning treason to our royal person
as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove 
the duke is virtuous  mild and too well given
to dream on evil or to work my downfall 


queen margaret

ah  what more dangerous than this fond affiance 
seems he a dove  his feathers are but borrowed 
for he disposed as the hateful raven 
is he a lamb  his skin is surely lent him 
for he inclined as is the ravenous wolf 
who cannot steal a shape that means deceit 
take heed  my lord  the welfare of us all
hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man 
enter somerset


somerset

all health unto my gracious sovereign 


king henry vi

welcome  lord somerset  what news from france 


somerset

that all your interest in those territories
is utterly bereft you  all is lost 


king henry vi

cold news  lord somerset  but god will be done 


york

 aside   cold news for me  for i had hope of france
as firmly as i hope for fertile england 
thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
and caterpillars eat my leaves away 
but i will remedy this gear ere long 
or sell my title for a glorious grave 
enter gloucester


gloucester

all happiness unto my lord the king 
pardon  my liege  that i have stay so long 


suffolk

nay  gloucester  know that thou art come too soon 
unless thou wert more loyal than thou art 
i do arrest thee of high treason here 


gloucester

well  suffolk  thou shalt not see me blush
nor change my countenance for this arrest 
a heart unspotted is not easily daunted 
the purest spring is not so free from mud
as i am clear from treason to my sovereign 
who can accuse me  wherein am i guilty 


york

 thought  my lord  that you took bribes of france 
and  being protector  stayed the soldiers  pay 
by means whereof his highness hath lost france 


gloucester

is it but thought so  what are they that think it 
i never robb the soldiers of their pay 
nor ever had one penny bribe from france 
so help me god  as i have watch the night 
ay  night by night  in studying good for england 
that doit that e i wrested from the king 
or any groat i hoarded to my use 
be brought against me at my trial day 
no  many a pound of mine own proper store 
because i would not tax the needy commons 
have i disbursed to the garrisons 
and never ask for restitution 


cardinal

it serves you well  my lord  to say so much 


gloucester

i say no more than truth  so help me god 


york

in your protectorship you did devise
strange tortures for offenders never heard of 
that england was defamed by tyranny 


gloucester

why   well known that  whiles i was
protector 
pity was all the fault that was in me 
for i should melt at an offender tears 
and lowly words were ransom for their fault 
unless it were a bloody murderer 
or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers 
i never gave them condign punishment 
murder indeed  that bloody sin  i tortured
above the felon or what trespass else 


suffolk

my lord  these faults are easy  quickly answered 
but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge 
whereof you cannot easily purge yourself 
i do arrest you in his highness  name 
and here commit you to my lord cardinal
to keep  until your further time of trial 


king henry vi

my lord of gloucester   my special hope
that you will clear yourself from all suspect 
my conscience tells me you are innocent 


gloucester

ah  gracious lord  these days are dangerous 
virtue is choked with foul ambition
and charity chased hence by rancour hand 
foul subornation is predominant
and equity exiled your highness  land 
i know their complot is to have my life 
and if my death might make this island happy 
and prove the period of their tyranny 
i would expend it with all willingness 
but mine is made the prologue to their play 
for thousands more  that yet suspect no peril 
will not conclude their plotted tragedy 
beaufort red sparkling eyes blab his heart malice 
and suffolk cloudy brow his stormy hate 
sharp buckingham unburthens with his tongue
the envious load that lies upon his heart 
and dogged york  that reaches at the moon 
whose overweening arm i have pluck back 
by false accuse doth level at my life 
and you  my sovereign lady  with the rest 
causeless have laid disgraces on my head 
and with your best endeavour have stirr up
my liefest liege to be mine enemy 
ay  all you have laid your heads together 
myself had notice of your conventicles 
and all to make away my guiltless life 
i shall not want false witness to condemn me 
nor store of treasons to augment my guilt 
the ancient proverb will be well effected 
 staff is quickly found to beat a dog 


cardinal

my liege  his railing is intolerable 
if those that care to keep your royal person
from treason secret knife and traitors  rage
be thus upbraided  chid and rated at 
and the offender granted scope of speech 
 make them cool in zeal unto your grace 


suffolk

hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
with ignominious words  though clerkly couch d 
as if she had suborned some to swear
false allegations to o his state 


queen margaret

but i can give the loser leave to chide 


gloucester

far truer spoke than meant  i lose  indeed 
beshrew the winners  for they play me false 
and well such losers may have leave to speak 


buckingham

he wrest the sense and hold us here all day 
lord cardinal  he is your prisoner 


cardinal

sirs  take away the duke  and guard him sure 


gloucester

ah  thus king henry throws away his crutch
before his legs be firm to bear his body 
thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side 
and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first 
ah  that my fear were false  ah  that it were 
for  good king henry  thy decay i fear 
exit  guarded


king henry vi

my lords  what to your wisdoms seemeth best 
do or undo  as if ourself were here 


queen margaret

what  will your highness leave the parliament 


king henry vi

ay  margaret  my heart is drown with grief 
whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes 
my body round engirt with misery 
for what more miserable than discontent 
ah  uncle humphrey  in thy face i see
the map of honour  truth and loyalty 
and yet  good humphrey  is the hour to come
that e i proved thee false or fear thy faith 
what louring star now envies thy estate 
that these great lords and margaret our queen
do seek subversion of thy harmless life 
thou never didst them wrong  nor no man wrong 
and as the butcher takes away the calf
and binds the wretch  and beats it when it strays 
bearing it to the bloody slaughter house 
even so remorseless have they borne him hence 
and as the dam runs lowing up and down 
looking the way her harmless young one went 
and can do nought but wail her darling loss 
even so myself bewails good gloucester case
with sad unhelpful tears  and with dimm eyes
look after him and cannot do him good 
so mighty are his vowed enemies 
his fortunes i will weep  and   each groan
say  who a traitor  gloucester he is none 
exeunt all but queen margaret  cardinal  suffolk  and york  somerset remains apart


queen margaret

free lords  cold snow melts with the sun hot beams 
henry my lord is cold in great affairs 
too full of foolish pity  and gloucester show
beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
with sorrow snares relenting passengers 
or as the snake roll in a flowering bank 
with shining chequer slough  doth sting a child
that for the beauty thinks it excellent 
believe me  lords  were none more wise than i 
and yet herein i judge mine own wit good 
this gloucester should be quickly rid the world 
to rid us of the fear we have of him 


cardinal

that he should die is worthy policy 
but yet we want a colour for his death 
 meet he be condemn by course of law 


suffolk

but  in my mind  that were no policy 
the king will labour still to save his life 
the commons haply rise  to save his life 
and yet we have but trivial argument 
more than mistrust  that shows him worthy death 


york

so that  by this  you would not have him die 


suffolk

ah  york  no man alive so fain as i 


york

 york that hath more reason for his death 
but  my lord cardinal  and you  my lord of suffolk 
say as you think  and speak it from your souls 
were not all one  an empty eagle were set
to guard the chicken from a hungry kite 
as place duke humphrey for the king protector 


queen margaret

so the poor chicken should be sure of death 


suffolk

madam   true  and were not madness  then 
to make the fox surveyor of the fold 
who being accused a crafty murderer 
his guilt should be but idly posted over 
because his purpose is not executed 
no  let him die  in that he is a fox 
by nature proved an enemy to the flock 
before his chaps be stain with crimson blood 
as humphrey  proved by reasons  to my liege 
and do not stand on quillets how to slay him 
be it by gins  by snares  by subtlety 
sleeping or waking   no matter how 
so he be dead  for that is good deceit
which mates him first that first intends deceit 


queen margaret

thrice noble suffolk   resolutely spoke 


suffolk

not resolute  except so much were done 
for things are often spoke and seldom meant 
but that my heart accordeth with my tongue 
seeing the deed is meritorious 
and to preserve my sovereign from his foe 
say but the word  and i will be his priest 


cardinal

but i would have him dead  my lord of suffolk 
ere you can take due orders for a priest 
say you consent and censure well the deed 
and i provide his executioner 
i tender so the safety of my liege 


suffolk

here is my hand  the deed is worthy doing 


queen margaret

and so say i 


york

and i    and now we three have spoke it 
it skills not greatly who impugns our doom 
enter a post


post

great lords  from ireland am i come amain 
to signify that rebels there are up
and put the englishmen unto the sword 
send succors  lords  and stop the rage betime 
before the wound do grow uncurable 
for  being green  there is great hope of help 


cardinal

a breach that craves a quick expedient stop 
what counsel give you in this weighty cause 


york

that somerset be sent as regent thither 
 meet that lucky ruler be employ d 
witness the fortune he hath had in france 


somerset

if york  with all his far fet policy 
had been the regent there instead of me 
he never would have stay in france so long 


york

no  not to lose it all  as thou hast done 
i rather would have lost my life betimes
than bring a burthen of dishonour home
by staying there so long till all were lost 
show me one scar character on thy skin 
men flesh preserved so whole do seldom win 


queen margaret

nay  then  this spark will prove a raging fire 
if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with 
no more  good york  sweet somerset  be still 
thy fortune  york  hadst thou been regent there 
might happily have proved far worse than his 


york

what  worse than nought  nay  then  a shame take all 


somerset

and  in the number  thee that wishest shame 


cardinal

my lord of york  try what your fortune is 
the uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms
and temper clay with blood of englishmen 
to ireland will you lead a band of men 
collected choicely  from each county some 
and try your hap against the irishmen 


york

i will  my lord  so please his majesty 


suffolk

why  our authority is his consent 
and what we do establish he confirms 
then  noble york  take thou this task in hand 


york

i am content  provide me soldiers  lords 
whiles i take order for mine own affairs 


suffolk

a charge  lord york  that i will see perform d 
but now return we to the false duke humphrey 


cardinal

no more of him  for i will deal with him
that henceforth he shall trouble us no more 
and so break off  the day is almost spent 
lord suffolk  you and i must talk of that event 


york

my lord of suffolk  within fourteen days
at bristol i expect my soldiers 
for there i ship them all for ireland 


suffolk

i see it truly done  my lord of york 
exeunt all but york


york

now  york  or never  steel thy fearful thoughts 
and change misdoubt to resolution 
be that thou hopest to be  or what thou art
resign to death  it is not worth the enjoying 
let pale faced fear keep with the mean born man 
and find no harbour in a royal heart 
faster than spring time showers comes thought
on thought 
and not a thought but thinks on dignity 
my brain more busy than the labouring spider
weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies 
well  nobles  well   politicly done 
to send me packing with an host of men 
i fear me you but warm the starved snake 
who  cherish in your breasts  will sting
your hearts 
 men i lack and you will give them me 
i take it kindly  and yet be well assured
you put sharp weapons in a madman hands 
whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band 
i will stir up in england some black storm
shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell 
and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
until the golden circuit on my head 
like to the glorious sun transparent beams 
do calm the fury of this mad bred flaw 
and  for a minister of my intent 
i have seduced a headstrong kentishman 
john cade of ashford 
to make commotion  as full well he can 
under the title of john mortimer 
in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade
oppose himself against a troop of kerns 
and fought so long  till that his thighs with darts
were almost like a sharp quill porpentine 
and  in the end being rescued  i have seen
him caper upright like a wild morisco 
shaking the bloody darts as he his bells 
full often  like a shag hair crafty kern 
hath he conversed with the enemy 
and undiscover come to me again
and given me notice of their villanies 
this devil here shall be my substitute 
for that john mortimer  which now is dead 
in face  in gait  in speech  he doth resemble 
by this i shall perceive the commons  mind 
how they affect the house and claim of york 
say he be taken  rack and tortured 
i know no pain they can inflict upon him
will make him say i moved him to those arms 
say that he thrive  as  great like he will 
why  then from ireland come i with my strength
and reap the harvest which that rascal sow d 
for humphrey being dead  as he shall be 
and henry put apart  the next for me
