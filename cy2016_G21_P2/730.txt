sonnet cxxxi

thou art as tyrannous  so as thou art 
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel 
for well thou know to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel 
yet  in good faith  some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan 
to say they err i dare not be so bold 
although i swear it to myself alone 
and  to be sure that is not false i swear 
a thousand groans  but thinking on thy face 
one on another neck  do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgment place 
  in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds 
  and thence this slander  as i think  proceeds
