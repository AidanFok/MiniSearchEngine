sonnet cxxxii

thine eyes i love  and they  as pitying me 
knowing thy heart torments me with disdain 
have put on black and loving mourners be 
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain 
and truly not the morning sun of heaven
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east 
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west 
as those two mourning eyes become thy face 
o  let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me  since mourning doth thee grace 
and suit thy pity like in every part 
  then will i swear beauty herself is black
  and all they foul that thy complexion lack
