sonnet cxxxiii

beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me 
is not enough to torture me alone 
but slave to slavery my sweet friend must be 
me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken 
and my next self thou harder hast engross d 
of him  myself  and thee  i am forsaken 
a torment thrice threefold thus to be cross d 
prison my heart in thy steel bosom ward 
but then my friend heart let my poor heart bail 
whoe keeps me  let my heart be his guard 
thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol 
  and yet thou wilt  for i  being pent in thee 
  perforce am thine  and all that is in me
