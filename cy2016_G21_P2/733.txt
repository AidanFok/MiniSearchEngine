so  now i have confess that he is thine 
and i myself am mortgaged to thy will 
myself i forfeit  so that other mine
thou wilt restore  to be my comfort still 
but thou wilt not  nor he will not be free 
for thou art covetous and he is kind 
he learn but surety like to write for me
under that bond that him as fast doth bind 
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take 
thou usurer  that put forth all to use 
and sue a friend came debtor for my sake 
so him i lose through my unkind abuse 
  him have i lost  thou hast both him and me 
  he pays the whole  and yet am i not free
