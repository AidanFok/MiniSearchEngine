sonnet cxxxix

o  call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart 
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue 
use power with power and slay me not by art 
tell me thou lovest elsewhere  but in my sight 
dear heart  forbear to glance thine eye aside 
what need thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my o er press defense can bide 
let me excuse thee  ah  my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies 
and therefore from my face she turns my foes 
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries 
  yet do not so  but since i am near slain 
  kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
