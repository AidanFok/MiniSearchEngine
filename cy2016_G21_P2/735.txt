whoever hath her wish  thou hast thy  will 
and  will  to boot  and  will  in overplus 
more than enough am i that vex thee still 
to thy sweet will making addition thus 
wilt thou  whose will is large and spacious 
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine 
shall will in others seem right gracious 
and in my will no fair acceptance shine 
the sea all water  yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store 
so thou  being rich in  will  add to thy  will 
one will of mine  to make thy large  will  more 
  let no unkind  no fair beseechers kill 
  think all but one  and me in that one  will
