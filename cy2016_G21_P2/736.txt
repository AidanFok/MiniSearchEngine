if thy soul cheque thee that i come so near 
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy  will 
and will  thy soul knows  is admitted there 
thus far for love my love suit  sweet  fulfil 
 will  will fulfil the treasure of thy love 
ay  fill it full with wills  and my will one 
in things of great receipt with ease we prove
among a number one is reckon none 
then in the number let me pass untold 
though in thy stores  account i one must be 
for nothing hold me  so it please thee hold
that nothing me  a something sweet to thee 
  make but my name thy love  and love that still 
  and then thou lovest me  for my name is  will
