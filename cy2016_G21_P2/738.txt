sonnet cxxxviii

when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her  though i know she lies 
that she might think me some untutor youth 
unlearned in the world false subtleties 
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young 
although she knows my days are past the best 
simply i credit her false speaking tongue 
on both sides thus is simple truth suppress d 
but wherefore says she not she is unjust 
and wherefore say not i that i am old 
o  love best habit is in seeming trust 
and age in love loves not to have years told 
  therefore i lie with her and she with me 
  and in our faults by lies we flatter be
