o heavenly god 


queen margaret

how fares my gracious lord 


suffolk

comfort  my sovereign  gracious henry  comfort 


king henry vi

what  doth my lord of suffolk comfort me 
came he right now to sing a raven note 
whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers 
and thinks he that the chirping of a wren 
by crying comfort from a hollow breast 
can chase away the first conceived sound 
hide not thy poison with such sugar words 
lay not thy hands on me  forbear  i say 
their touch affrights me as a serpent sting 
thou baleful messenger  out of my sight 
upon thy eye balls murderous tyranny
sits in grim majesty  to fright the world 
look not upon me  for thine eyes are wounding 
yet do not go away  come  basilisk 
and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight 
for in the shade of death i shall find joy 
in life but double death  now gloucester dead 


queen margaret

why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus 
although the duke was enemy to him 
yet he most christian like laments his death 
and for myself  foe as he was to me 
might liquid tears or heart offending groans
or blood consuming sighs recall his life 
i would be blind with weeping  sick with groans 
look pale as primrose with blood drinking sighs 
and all to have the noble duke alive 
what know i how the world may deem of me 
for it is known we were but hollow friends 
it may be judged i made the duke away 
so shall my name with slander tongue be wounded 
and princes  courts be fill with my reproach 
this get i by his death  ay me  unhappy 
to be a queen  and crown with infamy 


king henry vi

ah  woe is me for gloucester  wretched man 


queen margaret

be woe for me  more wretched than he is 
what  dost thou turn away and hide thy face 
i am no loathsome leper  look on me 
what  art thou  like the adder  waxen deaf 
be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen 
is all thy comfort shut in gloucester tomb 
why  then  dame margaret was ne thy joy 
erect his statue and worship it 
and make my image but an alehouse sign 
was i for this nigh wreck upon the sea
and twice by awkward wind from england bank
drove back again unto my native clime 
what boded this  but well forewarning wind
did seem to say  not a scorpion nest 
nor set no footing on this unkind shore 
what did i then  but cursed the gentle gusts
and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves 
and bid them blow towards england blessed shore 
or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
yet aeolus would not be a murderer 
but left that hateful office unto thee 
the pretty vaulting sea refused to drown me 
knowing that thou wouldst have me drown on shore 
with tears as salt as sea  through thy unkindness 
the splitting rocks cower in the sinking sands
and would not dash me with their ragged sides 
because thy flinty heart  more hard than they 
might in thy palace perish margaret 
as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs 
when from thy shore the tempest beat us back 
i stood upon the hatches in the storm 
and when the dusky sky began to rob
my earnest gaping sight of thy land view 
i took a costly jewel from my neck 
a heart it was  bound in with diamonds 
and threw it towards thy land  the sea received it 
and so i wish thy body might my heart 
and even with this i lost fair england view
and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
and call them blind and dusky spectacles 
for losing ken of albion wished coast 
how often have i tempted suffolk tongue 
the agent of thy foul inconstancy 
to sit and witch me  as ascanius did
when he to madding dido would unfold
his father acts commenced in burning troy 
am i not witch like her  or thou not false like him 
ay me  i can no more  die  margaret 
for henry weeps that thou dost live so long 
noise within  enter warwick  salisbury  and many commons


warwick

it is reported  mighty sovereign 
that good duke humphrey traitorously is murder 
by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort means 
the commons  like an angry hive of bees
that want their leader  scatter up and down
and care not who they sting in his revenge 
myself have calm their spleenful mutiny 
until they hear the order of his death 


king henry vi

that he is dead  good warwick   too true 
but how he died god knows  not henry 
enter his chamber  view his breathless corpse 
and comment then upon his sudden death 


warwick

that shall i do  my liege  stay  salisbury 
with the rude multitude till i return 
exit


king henry vi

o thou that judgest all things  stay my thoughts 
my thoughts  that labour to persuade my soul
some violent hands were laid on humphrey life 
if my suspect be false  forgive me  god 
for judgment only doth belong to thee 
fain would i go to chafe his paly lips
with twenty thousand kisses  and to drain
upon his face an ocean of salt tears 
to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk 
and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling 
but all in vain are these mean obsequies 
and to survey his dead and earthly image 
what were it but to make my sorrow greater 
re enter warwick and others  bearing gloucester body on a bed


warwick

come hither  gracious sovereign  view this body 


king henry vi

that is to see how deep my grave is made 
for with his soul fled all my worldly solace 
for seeing him i see my life in death 


warwick

as surely as my soul intends to live
with that dread king that took our state upon him
to free us from his father wrathful curse 
i do believe that violent hands were laid
upon the life of this thrice famed duke 


suffolk

a dreadful oath  sworn with a solemn tongue 
what instance gives lord warwick for his vow 


warwick

see how the blood is settled in his face 
oft have i seen a timely parted ghost 
of ashy semblance  meagre  pale and bloodless 
being all descended to the labouring heart 
who  in the conflict that it holds with death 
attracts the same for aidance  the enemy 
which with the heart there cools and ne returneth
to blush and beautify the cheek again 
but see  his face is black and full of blood 
his eye balls further out than when he lived 
staring full ghastly like a strangled man 
his hair uprear d  his nostrils stretched with struggling 
his hands abroad display d  as one that grasp 
and tugg for life and was by strength subdued 
look  on the sheets his hair you see  is sticking 
his well proportion beard made rough and rugged 
like to the summer corn by tempest lodged 
it cannot be but he was murder here 
the least of all these signs were probable 


suffolk

why  warwick  who should do the duke to death 
myself and beaufort had him in protection 
and we  i hope  sir  are no murderers 


warwick

but both of you were vow duke humphrey foes 
and you  forsooth  had the good duke to keep 
 like you would not feast him like a friend 
and  well seen he found an enemy 


queen margaret

then you  belike  suspect these noblemen
as guilty of duke humphrey timeless death 


warwick

who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
and sees fast by a butcher with an axe 
but will suspect  he that made the slaughter 
who finds the partridge in the puttock nest 
but may imagine how the bird was dead 
although the kite soar with unbloodied beak 
even so suspicious is this tragedy 


queen margaret

are you the butcher  suffolk  where your knife 
is beaufort term a kite  where are his talons 


suffolk

i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men 
but here a vengeful sword  rusted with ease 
that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
that slanders me with murder crimson badge 
say  if thou darest  proud lord of warwick shire 
that i am faulty in duke humphrey death 
exeunt cardinal  somerset  and others


warwick

what dares not warwick  if false suffolk dare him 


queen margaret

he dares not calm his contumelious spirit
nor cease to be an arrogant controller 
though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times 


warwick

madam  be still  with reverence may i say 
for every word you speak in his behalf
is slander to your royal dignity 


suffolk

blunt witted lord  ignoble in demeanor 
if ever lady wrong her lord so much 
thy mother took into her blameful bed
some stern untutor churl  and noble stock
was graft with crab tree slip  whose fruit thou art 
and never of the nevils  noble race 


warwick

but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
and i should rob the deathsman of his fee 
quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames 
and that my sovereign presence makes me mild 
i would  false murderous coward  on thy knee
make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech 
and say it was thy mother that thou meant 
that thou thyself was born in bastardy 
and after all this fearful homage done 
give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell 
pernicious blood sucker of sleeping men 


suffolk

thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood 
if from this presence thou darest go with me 


warwick

away even now  or i will drag thee hence 
unworthy though thou art  i cope with thee
and do some service to duke humphrey ghost 
exeunt suffolk and warwick


king henry vi

what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted 
thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just 
and he but naked  though lock up in steel
whose conscience with injustice is corrupted 
a noise within


queen margaret

what noise is this 
re enter suffolk and warwick  with their weapons drawn


king henry vi

why  how now  lords  your wrathful weapons drawn
here in our presence  dare you be so bold 
why  what tumultuous clamour have we here 


suffolk

the traitorous warwick with the men of bury
set all upon me  mighty sovereign 


salisbury

 to the commons  entering   sirs  stand apart 
the king shall know your mind 
dread lord  the commons send you word by me 
unless lord suffolk straight be done to death 
or banished fair england territories 
they will by violence tear him from your palace
and torture him with grievous lingering death 
they say  by him the good duke humphrey died 
they say  in him they fear your highness  death 
and mere instinct of love and loyalty 
free from a stubborn opposite intent 
as being thought to contradict your liking 
makes them thus forward in his banishment 
they say  in care of your most royal person 
that if your highness should intend to sleep
and charge that no man should disturb your rest
in pain of your dislike or pain of death 
yet  notwithstanding such a strait edict 
were there a serpent seen  with forked tongue 
that slily glided towards your majesty 
it were but necessary you were waked 
lest  being suffer in that harmful slumber 
the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal 
and therefore do they cry  though you forbid 
that they will guard you  whether you will or no 
from such fell serpents as false suffolk is 
with whose envenomed and fatal sting 
your loving uncle  twenty times his worth 
they say  is shamefully bereft of life 


commons

 within   an answer from the king  my
lord of salisbury 


suffolk

 like the commons  rude unpolish hinds 
could send such message to their sovereign 
but you  my lord  were glad to be employ d 
to show how quaint an orator you are 
but all the honour salisbury hath won
is  that he was the lord ambassador
sent from a sort of tinkers to the king 


commons

 within   an answer from the king  or we will all break in 


king henry vi

go  salisbury  and tell them all from me 
i thank them for their tender loving care 
and had i not been cited so by them 
yet did i purpose as they do entreat 
for  sure  my thoughts do hourly prophesy
mischance unto my state by suffolk means 
and therefore  by his majesty i swear 
whose far unworthy deputy i am 
he shall not breathe infection in this air
but three days longer  on the pain of death 
exit salisbury


queen margaret

o henry  let me plead for gentle suffolk 


king henry vi

ungentle queen  to call him gentle suffolk 
no more  i say  if thou dost plead for him 
thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath 
had i but said  i would have kept my word 
but when i swear  it is irrevocable 
if  after three days  space  thou here be found
on any ground that i am ruler of 
the world shall not be ransom for thy life 
come  warwick  come  good warwick  go with me 
i have great matters to impart to thee 
exeunt all but queen margaret and suffolk


queen margaret

mischance and sorrow go along with you 
heart discontent and sour affliction
be playfellows to keep you company 
there two of you  the devil make a third 
and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps 


suffolk

cease  gentle queen  these execrations 
and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave 


queen margaret

fie  coward woman and soft hearted wretch 
hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy 


suffolk

a plague upon them  wherefore should i curse them 
would curses kill  as doth the mandrake groan 
i would invent as bitter searching terms 
as curst  as harsh and horrible to hear 
deliver strongly through my fixed teeth 
with full as many signs of deadly hate 
as lean faced envy in her loathsome cave 
my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words 
mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint 
mine hair be fixed on end  as one distract 
ay  every joint should seem to curse and ban 
and even now my burthen heart would break 
should i not curse them  poison be their drink 
gall  worse than gall  the daintiest that they taste 
their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees 
their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks 
their softest touch as smart as lizards  sting 
their music frightful as the serpent hiss 
and boding screech owls make the concert full 
all the foul terrors in dark seated hell 


queen margaret

enough  sweet suffolk  thou torment thyself 
and these dread curses  like the sun  glass 
or like an overcharged gun  recoil 
and turn the force of them upon thyself 


suffolk

you bade me ban  and will you bid me leave 
now  by the ground that i am banish from 
well could i curse away a winter night 
though standing naked on a mountain top 
where biting cold would never let grass grow 
and think it but a minute spent in sport 


queen margaret

o  let me entreat thee cease  give me thy hand 
that i may dew it with my mournful tears 
nor let the rain of heaven wet this place 
to wash away my woful monuments 
o  could this kiss be printed in thy hand 
that thou mightst think upon these by the seal 
through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee 
so  get thee gone  that i may know my grief 
 but surmised whiles thou art standing by 
as one that surfeits thinking on a want 
i will repeal thee  or  be well assured 
adventure to be banished myself 
and banished i am  if but from thee 
go  speak not to me  even now be gone 
o  go not yet  even thus two friends condemn 
embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves 
loather a hundred times to part than die 
yet now farewell  and farewell life with thee 


suffolk

thus is poor suffolk ten times banished 
once by the king  and three times thrice by thee 
 not the land i care for  wert thou thence 
a wilderness is populous enough 
so suffolk had thy heavenly company 
for where thou art  there is the world itself 
with every several pleasure in the world 
and where thou art not  desolation 
i can no more  live thou to joy thy life 
myself no joy in nought but that thou livest 
enter vaux


queen margaret

wither goes vaux so fast  what news  i prithee 


vaux

to signify unto his majesty
that cardinal beaufort is at point of death 
for suddenly a grievous sickness took him 
that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air 
blaspheming god and cursing men on earth 
sometimes he talks as if duke humphrey ghost
were by his side  sometime he calls the king 
and whispers to his pillow  as to him 
the secrets of his overcharged soul 
and i am sent to tell his majesty
that even now he cries aloud for him 


queen margaret

go tell this heavy message to the king 
exit vaux
ay me  what is this world  what news are these 
but wherefore grieve i at an hour poor loss 
omitting suffolk exile  my soul treasure 
why only  suffolk  mourn i not for thee 
and with the southern clouds contend in tears 
theirs for the earth increase  mine for my sorrows 
now get thee hence  the king  thou know st  is coming 
if thou be found by me  thou art but dead 


suffolk

if i depart from thee  i cannot live 
and in thy sight to die  what were it else
but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap 
here could i breathe my soul into the air 
as mild and gentle as the cradle babe
dying with mother dug between its lips 
where  from thy sight  i should be raging mad 
and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes 
to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth 
so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul 
or i should breathe it so into thy body 
and then it lived in sweet elysium 
to die by thee were but to die in jest 
from thee to die were torture more than death 
o  let me stay  befall what may befall 


queen margaret

away  though parting be a fretful corrosive 
it is applied to a deathful wound 
to france  sweet suffolk  let me hear from thee 
for wheresoe thou art in this world globe 
i have an iris that shall find thee out 


suffolk

i go 


queen margaret

and take my heart with thee 


suffolk

a jewel  lock into the wofull cask
that ever did contain a thing of worth 
even as a splitted bark  so sunder we
this way fall i to death 


queen margaret

this way for me 
exeunt severally
