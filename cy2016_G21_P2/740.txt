sonnet ii

when forty winters shall beseige thy brow 
and dig deep trenches in thy beauty field 
thy youth proud livery  so gazed on now 
will be a tatter weed  of small worth held 
then being ask where all thy beauty lies 
where all the treasure of thy lusty days 
to say  within thine own deep sunken eyes 
were an all eating shame and thriftless praise 
how much more praise deserved thy beauty use 
if thou couldst answer  fair child of mine
shall sum my count and make my old excuse 
proving his beauty by succession thine 
  this were to be new made when thou art old 
  and see thy blood warm when thou feel it cold
