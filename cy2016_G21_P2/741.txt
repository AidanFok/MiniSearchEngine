sonnet iii

look in thy glass  and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another 
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest 
thou dost beguile the world  unbless some mother 
for where is she so fair whose unear womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry 
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his self love  to stop posterity 
thou art thy mother glass  and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime 
so thou through windows of thine age shall see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time 
  but if thou live  remember not to be 
  die single  and thine image dies with thee
