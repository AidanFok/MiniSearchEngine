sonnet iv

unthrifty loveliness  why dost thou spend
upon thyself thy beauty legacy 
nature bequest gives nothing but doth lend 
and being frank she lends to those are free 
then  beauteous niggard  why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give 
profitless usurer  why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums  yet canst not live 
for having traffic with thyself alone 
thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive 
then how  when nature calls thee to be gone 
what acceptable audit canst thou leave 
  thy unused beauty must be tomb with thee 
  which  used  lives th  executor to be
