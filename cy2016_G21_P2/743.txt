sonnet ix

is it for fear to wet a widow eye
that thou consumest thyself in single life 
ah  if thou issueless shalt hap to die 
the world will wail thee  like a makeless wife 
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind 
when every private widow well may keep
by children eyes her husband shape in mind 
look  what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place  for still the world enjoys it 
but beauty waste hath in the world an end 
and kept unused  the user so destroys it 
  no love toward others in that bosom sits
  that on himself such murderous shame commits
