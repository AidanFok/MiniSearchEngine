so am i as the rich  whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure 
the which he will not every hour survey 
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure 
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare 
since  seldom coming  in the long year set 
like stones of worth they thinly placed are 
or captain jewels in the carcanet 
so is the time that keeps you as my chest 
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide 
to make some special instant special blest 
by new unfolding his imprison pride 
  blessed are you  whose worthiness gives scope 
  being had  to triumph  being lack d  to hope
