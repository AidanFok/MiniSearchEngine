enter the king  salisbury  warwick  to the cardinal in bed


king henry vi

how fares my lord  speak  beaufort  to
thy sovereign 


cardinal

if thou be death  i give thee england treasure 
enough to purchase such another island 
so thou wilt let me live  and feel no pain 


king henry vi

ah  what a sign it is of evil life 
where death approach is seen so terrible 


warwick

beaufort  it is thy sovereign speaks to thee 


cardinal

bring me unto my trial when you will 
died he not in his bed  where should he die 
can i make men live  whether they will or no 
o  torture me no more  i will confess 
alive again  then show me where he is 
i give a thousand pound to look upon him 
he hath no eyes  the dust hath blinded them 
comb down his hair  look  look  it stands upright 
like lime twigs set to catch my winged soul 
give me some drink  and bid the apothecary
bring the strong poison that i bought of him 


king henry vi

o thou eternal mover of the heavens 
look with a gentle eye upon this wretch 
o  beat away the busy meddling fiend
that lays strong siege unto this wretch soul 
and from his bosom purge this black despair 


warwick

see  how the pangs of death do make him grin 


salisbury

disturb him not  let him pass peaceably 


king henry vi

peace to his soul  if god good pleasure be 
lord cardinal  if thou think on heaven bliss 
hold up thy hand  make signal of thy hope 
he dies  and makes no sign  o god  forgive him 


warwick

so bad a death argues a monstrous life 


king henry vi

forbear to judge  for we are sinners all 
close up his eyes and draw the curtain close 
and let us all to meditation 
exeunt
