not marble  nor the gilded monuments
of princes  shall outlive this powerful rhyme 
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmear with sluttish time 
when wasteful war shall statues overturn 
and broils root out the work of masonry 
nor mars his sword nor war quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory 
 death and all oblivious enmity
shall you pace forth  your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom 
  so  till the judgment that yourself arise 
  you live in this  and dwell in lover eyes
