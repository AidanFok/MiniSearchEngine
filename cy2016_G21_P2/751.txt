sonnet lvi

sweet love  renew thy force  be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite 
which but to day by feeding is allay d 
to morrow sharpen in his former might 
so  love  be thou  although to day thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness 
to morrow see again  and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dullness 
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore  where two contracted new
come daily to the banks  that  when they see
return of love  more blest may be the view 
  else call it winter  which being full of care
  makes summer welcome thrice more wish d  more rare
