sonnet lviii

that god forbid that made me first your slave 
i should in thought control your times of pleasure 
or at your hand the account of hours to crave 
being your vassal  bound to stay your leisure 
o  let me suffer  being at your beck 
the imprison absence of your liberty 
and patience  tame to sufferance  bide each cheque 
without accusing you of injury 
be where you list  your charter is so strong
that you yourself may privilege your time
to what you will  to you it doth belong
yourself to pardon of self doing crime 
  i am to wait  though waiting so be hell 
  not blame your pleasure  be it ill or well
