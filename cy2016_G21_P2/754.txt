like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore 
so do our minutes hasten to their end 
each changing place with that which goes before 
in sequent toil all forwards do contend 
nativity  once in the main of light 
crawls to maturity  wherewith being crown d 
crooked elipses  his glory fight 
and time that gave doth now his gift confound 
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beauty brow 
feeds on the rarities of nature truth 
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow 
  and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand 
  praising thy worth  despite his cruel hand
