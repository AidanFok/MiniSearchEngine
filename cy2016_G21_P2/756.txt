sonnet lxii
sonnet lxii

sin of self love possesseth all mine eye
and all my soul and all my every part 
and for this sin there is no remedy 
it is so grounded inward in my heart 
methinks no face so gracious is as mine 
no shape so true  no truth of such account 
and for myself mine own worth do define 
as i all other in all worths surmount 
but when my glass shows me myself indeed 
beated and chopp with tann antiquity 
mine own self love quite contrary i read 
self so self loving were iniquity 
   thee  myself  that for myself i praise 
  painting my age with beauty of thy days
