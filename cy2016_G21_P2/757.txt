sonnet lxiii
sonnet lxiii

against my love shall be  as i am now 
with time injurious hand crush and o er worn 
when hours have drain his blood and fill his brow
with lines and wrinkles  when his youthful morn
hath travell on to age steepy night 
and all those beauties whereof now he king
are vanishing or vanish out of sight 
stealing away the treasure of his spring 
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding age cruel knife 
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet love beauty  though my lover life 
  his beauty shall in these black lines be seen 
  and they shall live  and he in them still green
