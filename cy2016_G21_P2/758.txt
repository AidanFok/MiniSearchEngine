sonnet lxiv

when i have seen by time fell hand defaced
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age 
when sometime lofty towers i see down razed
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage 
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore 
and the firm soil win of the watery main 
increasing store with loss and loss with store 
when i have seen such interchange of state 
or state itself confounded to decay 
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate 
that time will come and take my love away 
  this thought is as a death  which cannot choose
  but weep to have that which it fears to lose
