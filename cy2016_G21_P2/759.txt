sonnet lxix
sonnet lxix

those parts of thee that the world eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend 
all tongues  the voice of souls  give thee that due 
uttering bare truth  even so as foes commend 
thy outward thus with outward praise is crown d 
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown 
they look into the beauty of thy mind 
and that  in guess  they measure by thy deeds 
then  churls  their thoughts  although their eyes were kind 
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds 
  but why thy odour matcheth not thy show 
  the solve is this  that thou dost common grow
