scene i  the coast of kent 


alarum  fight at sea  ordnance goes off  enter a  captain  a master  a master s mate  walter whitmore  and others  with them suffolk  and others  prisoners


captain

the gaudy  blabbing and remorseful day
is crept into the bosom of the sea 
and now loud howling wolves arouse the jades
that drag the tragic melancholy night 
who  with their drowsy  slow and flagging wings 
clip dead men graves and from their misty jaws
breathe foul contagious darkness in the air 
therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize 
for  whilst our pinnace anchors in the downs 
here shall they make their ransom on the sand 
or with their blood stain this discolour shore 
master  this prisoner freely give i thee 
and thou that art his mate  make boot of this 
the other  walter whitmore  is thy share 


first gentleman

what is my ransom  master  let me know 


master

a thousand crowns  or else lay down your head 
master s mate	and so much shall you give  or off goes yours 


captain

what  think you much to pay two thousand crowns 
and bear the name and port of gentlemen 
cut both the villains  throats  for die you shall 
the lives of those which we have lost in fight
be counterpoised with such a petty sum 


first gentleman

i give it  sir  and therefore spare my life 


second gentleman

and so will i and write home for it straight 


whitmore

i lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard 
and therefore to revenge it  shalt thou die 
to suffolk
and so should these  if i might have my will 


captain

be not so rash  take ransom  let him live 


suffolk

look on my george  i am a gentleman 
rate me at what thou wilt  thou shalt be paid 


whitmore

and so am i  my name is walter whitmore 
how now  why start thou  what  doth
death affright 


suffolk

thy name affrights me  in whose sound is death 
a cunning man did calculate my birth
and told me that by water i should die 
yet let not this make thee be bloody minded 
thy name is gaultier  being rightly sounded 


whitmore

gaultier or walter  which it is  i care not 
never yet did base dishonour blur our name 
but with our sword we wiped away the blot 
therefore  when merchant like i sell revenge 
broke be my sword  my arms torn and defaced 
and i proclaim a coward through the world 


suffolk

stay  whitmore  for thy prisoner is a prince 
the duke of suffolk  william de la pole 


whitmore

the duke of suffolk muffled up in rags 


suffolk

ay  but these rags are no part of the duke 
jove sometimes went disguised  and why not i 


captain

but jove was never slain  as thou shalt be 


suffolk

obscure and lowly swain  king henry blood 
the honourable blood of lancaster 
must not be shed by such a jaded groom 
hast thou not kiss thy hand and held my stirrup 
bare headed plodded by my foot cloth mule
and thought thee happy when i shook my head 
how often hast thou waited at my cup 
fed from my trencher  kneel down at the board 
when i have feasted with queen margaret 
remember it and let it make thee crest fall n 
ay  and allay this thy abortive pride 
how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
and duly waited for my coming forth 
this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf 
and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue 


whitmore

speak  captain  shall i stab the forlorn swain 


captain

first let my words stab him  as he hath me 


suffolk

base slave  thy words are blunt and so art thou 


captain

convey him hence and on our longboat side
strike off his head 


suffolk

thou darest not  for thy own 


captain

yes  pole 


suffolk

       pole 


captain

         pool  sir pool  lord 
ay  kennel  puddle  sink  whose filth and dirt
troubles the silver spring where england drinks 
now will i dam up this thy yawning mouth
for swallowing the treasure of the realm 
thy lips that kiss the queen shall sweep the ground 
and thou that smiledst at good duke humphrey death 
against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain 
who in contempt shall hiss at thee again 
and wedded be thou to the hags of hell 
for daring to affy a mighty lord
unto the daughter of a worthless king 
having neither subject  wealth  nor diadem 
by devilish policy art thou grown great 
and  like ambitious sylla  overgorged
with gobbets of thy mother bleeding heart 
by thee anjou and maine were sold to france 
the false revolting normans thorough thee
disdain to call us lord  and picardy
hath slain their governors  surprised our forts 
and sent the ragged soldiers wounded home 
the princely warwick  and the nevils all 
whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain 
as hating thee  are rising up in arms 
and now the house of york  thrust from the crown
by shameful murder of a guiltless king
and lofty proud encroaching tyranny 
burns with revenging fire  whose hopeful colours
advance our half faced sun  striving to shine 
under the which is writ  nubibus 
the commons here in kent are up in arms 
and  to conclude  reproach and beggary
is crept into the palace of our king 
and all by thee  away  convey him hence 


suffolk

o that i were a god  to shoot forth thunder
upon these paltry  servile  abject drudges 
small things make base men proud  this villain here 
being captain of a pinnace  threatens more
than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate 
drones suck not eagles  blood but rob beehives 
it is impossible that i should die
by such a lowly vassal as thyself 
thy words move rage and not remorse in me 
i go of message from the queen to france 
i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel 


captain

walter 


whitmore

come  suffolk  i must waft thee to thy death 


suffolk

gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear 


whitmore

thou shalt have cause to fear before i leave thee 
what  are ye daunted now  now will ye stoop 


first gentleman

my gracious lord  entreat him  speak him fair 


suffolk

suffolk imperial tongue is stern and rough 
used to command  untaught to plead for favour 
far be it we should honour such as these
with humble suit  no  rather let my head
stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
save to the god of heaven and to my king 
and sooner dance upon a bloody pole
than stand uncover to the vulgar groom 
true nobility is exempt from fear 
more can i bear than you dare execute 


captain

hale him away  and let him talk no more 


suffolk

come  soldiers  show what cruelty ye can 
that this my death may never be forgot 
great men oft die by vile bezonians 
a roman sworder and banditto slave
murder sweet tully  brutus  bastard hand
stabb julius caesar  savage islanders
pompey the great  and suffolk dies by pirates 
exeunt whitmore and others with suffolk


captain

and as for these whose ransom we have set 
it is our pleasure one of them depart 
therefore come you with us and let him go 
exeunt all but the first gentleman
re enter whitmore with suffolk body


whitmore

there let his head and lifeless body lie 
until the queen his mistress bury it 
exit


first gentleman

o barbarous and bloody spectacle 
his body will i bear unto the king 
if he revenge it not  yet will his friends 
so will the queen  that living held him dear 
exit with the body
