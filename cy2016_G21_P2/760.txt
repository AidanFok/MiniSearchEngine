sonnet lxv

since brass  nor stone  nor earth  nor boundless sea 
but sad mortality o er sways their power 
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea 
whose action is no stronger than a flower 
o  how shall summer honey breath hold out
against the wreckful siege of battering days 
when rocks impregnable are not so stout 
nor gates of steel so strong  but time decays 
o fearful meditation  where  alack 
shall time best jewel from time chest lie hid 
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back 
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid 
  o  none  unless this miracle have might 
  that in black ink my love may still shine bright
