sonnet lxvi
sonnet lxvi

tired with all these  for restful death i cry 
as  to behold desert a beggar born 
and needy nothing trimm in jollity 
and purest faith unhappily forsworn 
and guilded honour shamefully misplaced 
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted 
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced 
and strength by limping sway disabled 
and art made tongue tied by authority 
and folly doctor like controlling skill 
and simple truth miscall simplicity 
and captive good attending captain ill 
  tired with all these  from these would i be gone 
  save that  to die  i leave my love alone
