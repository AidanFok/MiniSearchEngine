sonnet lxvii

ah  wherefore with infection should he live 
and with his presence grace impiety 
that sin by him advantage should achieve
and lace itself with his society 
why should false painting imitate his cheek
and steal dead seeing of his living hue 
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow  since his rose is true 
why should he live  now nature bankrupt is 
beggar of blood to blush through lively veins 
for she hath no exchequer now but his 
and  proud of many  lives upon his gains 
  o  him she stores  to show what wealth she had
  in days long since  before these last so bad
