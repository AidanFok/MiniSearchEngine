sonnet lxviii
sonnet lxviii

thus is his cheek the map of days outworn 
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now 
before the bastard signs of fair were born 
or durst inhabit on a living brow 
before the golden tresses of the dead 
the right of sepulchres  were shorn away 
to live a second life on second head 
ere beauty dead fleece made another gay 
in him those holy antique hours are seen 
without all ornament  itself and true 
making no summer of another green 
robbing no old to dress his beauty new 
  and him as for a map doth nature store 
  to show false art what beauty was of yore
