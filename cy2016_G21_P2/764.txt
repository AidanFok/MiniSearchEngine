that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect 
for slander mark was ever yet the fair 
the ornament of beauty is suspect 
a crow that flies in heaven sweetest air 
so thou be good  slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater  being woo of time 
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love 
and thou present a pure unstained prime 
thou hast pass by the ambush of young days 
either not assail or victor being charged 
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise 
to tie up envy evermore enlarged 
  if some suspect of ill mask not thy show 
  then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
