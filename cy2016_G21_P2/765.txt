sonnet lxxi

no longer mourn for me when i am dead
then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world  with vilest worms to dwell 
nay  if you read this line  remember not
the hand that writ it  for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe 
o  if  i say  you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay 
do not so much as my poor name rehearse 
but let your love even with my life decay 
  lest the wise world should look into your moan
  and mock you with me after i am gone
