sonnet lxxii

o  lest the world should task you to recite
what merit lived in me  that you should love
after my death  dear love  forget me quite 
for you in me can nothing worthy prove 
unless you would devise some virtuous lie 
to do more for me than mine own desert 
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart 
o  lest your true love may seem false in this 
that you for love speak well of me untrue 
my name be buried where my body is 
and live no more to shame nor me nor you 
  for i am shamed by that which i bring forth 
  and so should you  to love things nothing worth
