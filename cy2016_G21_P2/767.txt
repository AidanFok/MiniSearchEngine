sonnet lxxiii

that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves  or none  or few  do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold 
bare ruin choirs  where late the sweet birds sang 
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west 
which by and by black night doth take away 
death second self  that seals up all in rest 
in me thou see the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie 
as the death bed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourish by 
  this thou perceivest  which makes thy love more strong 
  to love that well which thou must leave ere long
