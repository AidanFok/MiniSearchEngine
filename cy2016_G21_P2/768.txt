but be contented  when that fell arrest
without all bail shall carry me away 
my life hath in this line some interest 
which for memorial still with thee shall stay 
when thou reviewest this  thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee 
the earth can have but earth  which is his due 
my spirit is thine  the better part of me 
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life 
the prey of worms  my body being dead 
the coward conquest of a wretch knife 
too base of thee to be remembered 
  the worth of that is that which it contains 
  and that is this  and this with thee remains
