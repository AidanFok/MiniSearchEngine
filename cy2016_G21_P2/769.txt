sonnet lxxix

whilst i alone did call upon thy aid 
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace 
but now my gracious numbers are decay 
and my sick muse doth give another place 
i grant  sweet love  thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen 
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of and pays it thee again 
he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
from thy behavior  beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek  he can afford
no praise to thee but what in thee doth live 
  then thank him not for that which he doth say 
  since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay
