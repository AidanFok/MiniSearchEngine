fie on ambition  fie on myself  that have a sword 
and yet am ready to famish  these five days have i
hid me in these woods and durst not peep out  for
all the country is laid for me  but now am i so
hungry that if i might have a lease of my life for a
thousand years i could stay no longer  wherefore 
on a brick wall have i climbed into this garden  to
see if i can eat grass  or pick a sallet another
while  which is not amiss to cool a man stomach
this hot weather  and i think this word  sallet 
was born to do me good  for many a time  but for a
sallet  my brainpan had been cleft with a brown
bill  and many a time  when i have been dry and
bravely marching  it hath served me instead of a
quart pot to drink in  and now the word  sallet 
must serve me to feed on

lord  who would live turmoiled in the court 
and may enjoy such quiet walks as these 
this small inheritance my father left me
contenteth me  and worth a monarchy 
i seek not to wax great by others  waning 
or gather wealth  i care not  with what envy 
sufficeth that i have maintains my state
and sends the poor well pleased from my gate 


cade

here the lord of the soil come to seize me for a
stray  for entering his fee simple without leave 
ah  villain  thou wilt betray me  and get a thousand
crowns of the king carrying my head to him  but
i make thee eat iron like an ostrich  and swallow
my sword like a great pin  ere thou and i part 


iden

why  rude companion  whatsoe thou be 
i know thee not  why  then  should i betray thee 
is not enough to break into my garden 
and  like a thief  to come to rob my grounds 
climbing my walls in spite of me the owner 
but thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms 


cade

brave thee  ay  by the best blood that ever was
broached  and beard thee too  look on me well  i
have eat no meat these five days  yet  come thou and
thy five men  and if i do not leave you all as dead
as a doornail  i pray god i may never eat grass more

nay  it shall ne be said  while england stands 
that alexander iden  an esquire of kent 
took odds to combat a poor famish man 
oppose thy steadfast gazing eyes to mine 
see if thou canst outface me with thy looks 
set limb to limb  and thou art far the lesser 
thy hand is but a finger to my fist 
thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon 
my foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast 
and if mine arm be heaved in the air 
thy grave is digg already in the earth 
as for words  whose greatness answers words 
let this my sword report what speech forbears 


cade

by my valour  the most complete champion that ever i
heard  steel  if thou turn the edge  or cut not out
the burly boned clown in chines of beef ere thou
sleep in thy sheath  i beseech god on my knees thou
mayst be turned to hobnails 
here they fight  cade falls
o  i am slain  famine and no other hath slain me 
let ten thousand devils come against me  and give me
but the ten meals i have lost  and i defy them
all  wither  garden  and be henceforth a
burying place to all that do dwell in this house 
because the unconquered soul of cade is fled 


iden

is cade that i have slain  that monstrous traitor 
sword  i will hollow thee for this thy deed 
and hang thee o my tomb when i am dead 
ne shall this blood be wiped from thy point 
but thou shalt wear it as a herald coat 
to emblaze the honour that thy master got 


cade

iden  farewell  and be proud of thy victory  tell
kent from me  she hath lost her best man  and exhort
all the world to be cowards  for i  that never
feared any  am vanquished by famine  not by valour 
dies


iden

how much thou wrong me  heaven be my judge 
die  damned wretch  the curse of her that bare thee 
and as i thrust thy body in with my sword 
so wish i  i might thrust thy soul to hell 
hence will i drag thee headlong by the heels
unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave 
and there cut off thy most ungracious head 
which i will bear in triumph to the king 
leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon
