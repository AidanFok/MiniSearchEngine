sonnet lxxv

so are you to my thoughts as food to life 
or as sweet season showers are to the ground 
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as  a miser and his wealth is found 
now proud as an enjoyer and anon
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure 
now counting best to be with you alone 
then better that the world may see my pleasure 
sometime all full with feasting on your sight
and by and by clean starved for a look 
possessing or pursuing no delight 
save what is had or must from you be took 
  thus do i pine and surfeit day by day 
  or gluttoning on all  or all away
