sonnet lxxvii

thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear 
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste 
the vacant leaves thy mind imprint will bear 
and of this book this learning mayst thou taste 
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
of mouthed graves will give thee memory 
thou by thy dial shady stealth mayst know
time thievish progress to eternity 
look  what thy memory can not contain
commit to these waste blanks  and thou shalt find
those children nursed  deliver from thy brain 
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind 
  these offices  so oft as thou wilt look 
  shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
