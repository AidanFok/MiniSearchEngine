sonnet lxxviii

so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse 
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
have added feathers to the learned wing
and given grace a double majesty 
yet be most proud of that which i compile 
whose influence is thine and born of thee 
in others  works thou dost but mend the style 
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be 
  but thou art all my art and dost advance
  as high as learning my rude ignorance
