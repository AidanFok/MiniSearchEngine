sonnet lxxx

o  how i faint when i of you do write 
knowing a better spirit doth use your name 
and in the praise thereof spends all his might 
to make me tongue tied  speaking of your fame 
but since your worth  wide as the ocean is 
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear 
my saucy bark inferior far to his
on your broad main doth wilfully appear 
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat 
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride 
or being wreck d  i am a worthless boat 
he of tall building and of goodly pride 
  then if he thrive and i be cast away 
  the worst was this  my love was my decay
