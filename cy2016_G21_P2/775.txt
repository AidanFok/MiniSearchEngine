sonnet lxxxi

or i shall live your epitaph to make 
or you survive when i in earth am rotten 
from hence your memory death cannot take 
although in me each part will be forgotten 
your name from hence immortal life shall have 
though i  once gone  to all the world must die 
the earth can yield me but a common grave 
when you entombed in men eyes shall lie 
your monument shall be my gentle verse 
which eyes not yet created shall o er read 
and tongues to be your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead 
  you still shall live such virtue hath my pen 
  where breath most breathes  even in the mouths of men
