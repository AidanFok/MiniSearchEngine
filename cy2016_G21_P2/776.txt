sonnet lxxxii

i grant thou wert not married to my muse
and therefore mayst without attaint o 
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject  blessing every book
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue 
finding thy worth a limit past my praise 
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the time bettering days
and do so  love  yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend 
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
in true plain words by thy true telling friend 
  and their gross painting might be better used
  where cheeks need blood  in thee it is abused
