sonnet lxxxiii

i never saw that you did painting need
and therefore to your fair no painting set 
i found  or thought i found  you did exceed
the barren tender of a poet debt 
and therefore have i slept in your report 
that you yourself being extant well might show
how far a modern quill doth come too short 
speaking of worth  what worth in you doth grow 
this silence for my sin you did impute 
which shall be most my glory  being dumb 
for i impair not beauty being mute 
when others would give life and bring a tomb 
  there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
  than both your poets can in praise devise
