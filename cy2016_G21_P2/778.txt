sonnet lxxxiv

who is it that says most  which can say more
than this rich praise  that you alone are you 
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew 
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory 
but he that writes of you  if he can tell
that you are you  so dignifies his story 
let him but copy what in you is writ 
not making worse what nature made so clear 
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit 
making his style admired every where 
  you to your beauteous blessings add a curse 
  being fond on praise  which makes your praises worse
