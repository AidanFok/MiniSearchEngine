sonnet lxxxix

say that thou didst forsake me for some fault 
and i will comment upon that offence 
speak of my lameness  and i straight will halt 
against thy reasons making no defence 
thou canst not  love  disgrace me half so ill 
to set a form upon desired change 
as i myself disgrace  knowing thy will 
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange 
be absent from thy walks  and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell 
lest i  too much profane  should do it wrong
and haply of our old acquaintance tell 
  for thee against myself i vow debate 
  for i must ne love him whom thou dost hate
