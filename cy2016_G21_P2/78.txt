bevis

holland

which is as much to say as  let the magistrates be
labouring men  and therefore should we be

brave mind than a hard hand

plain dealing man

rebellious hinds  the filth and scum of kent 
mark for the gallows  lay your weapons down 
home to your cottages  forsake this groom 
the king is merciful  if you revolt 


william stafford

but angry  wrathful  and inclined to blood 
if you go forward  therefore yield  or die 


cade

as for these silken coated slaves  i pass not 
it is to you  good people  that i speak 
over whom  in time to come  i hope to reign 
for i am rightful heir unto the crown 


sir humphrey

villain  thy father was a plasterer 
and thou thyself a shearman  art thou not 


cade

and adam was a gardener 


william stafford

and what of that 


cade

marry  this  edmund mortimer  earl of march 
married the duke of clarence  daughter  did he not 


sir humphrey

ay  sir 


cade

by her he had two children at one birth 


william stafford

that false 


cade

ay  there the question  but i say   true 
the elder of them  being put to nurse 
was by a beggar woman stolen away 
and  ignorant of his birth and parentage 
became a bricklayer when he came to age 
his son am i  deny it  if you can 


dick

nay   too true  therefore he shall be king 


smith

sir  he made a chimney in my father house  and
the bricks are alive at this day to testify it 
therefore deny it not 


sir humphrey

and will you credit this base drudge words 
that speaks he knows not what 


all

ay  marry  will we  therefore get ye gone 


william stafford

jack cade  the duke of york hath taught you this 


cade

 aside   he lies  for i invented it myself 
go to  sirrah  tell the king from me  that  for his
father sake  henry the fifth  in whose time boys
went to span counter for french crowns  i am content
he shall reign  but i be protector over him 


dick

and furthermore  well have the lord say head for
selling the dukedom of maine 


cade

and good reason  for thereby is england mained  and
fain to go with a staff  but that my puissance holds
it up  fellow kings  i tell you that that lord say
hath gelded the commonwealth  and made it an eunuch 
and more than that  he can speak french  and
therefore he is a traitor 


sir humphrey

o gross and miserable ignorance 


cade

nay  answer  if you can  the frenchmen are our
enemies  go to  then  i ask but this  can he that
speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good
counsellor  or no 


all

no  no  and therefore we have his head 


william stafford

well  seeing gentle words will not prevail 
assail them with the army of the king 


sir humphrey

herald  away  and throughout every town
proclaim them traitors that are up with cade 
that those which fly before the battle ends
may  even in their wives  and children sight 
be hang up for example at their doors 
and you that be the king friends  follow me 
exeunt william stafford and sir humphrey  and soldiers


cade

and you that love the commons  follow me 
now show yourselves men   for liberty 
we will not leave one lord  one gentleman 
spare none but such as go in clouted shoon 
for they are thrifty honest men  and such
as would  but that they dare not  take our parts 


dick

they are all in order and march toward us 


cade

but then are we in order when we are most
out of order  come  march forward 
exeunt
