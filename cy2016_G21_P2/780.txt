sonnet lxxxv

my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still 
while comments of your praise  richly compiled 
reserve their character with golden quill
and precious phrase by all the muses filed 
i think good thoughts whilst other write good words 
and like unletter clerk still cry  amen 
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polish form of well refined pen 
hearing you praised  i say  so   true 
and to the most of praise add something more 
but that is in my thought  whose love to you 
though words come hindmost  holds his rank before 
  then others for the breath of words respect 
  me for my dumb thoughts  speaking in effect
