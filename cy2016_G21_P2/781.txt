sonnet lxxxvi

was it the proud full sail of his great verse 
bound for the prize of all too precious you 
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse 
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew 
was it his spirit  by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch  that struck me dead 
no  neither he  nor his compeers by night
giving him aid  my verse astonished 
he  nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
as victors of my silence cannot boast 
i was not sick of any fear from thence 
  but when your countenance fill up his line 
  then lack i matter  that enfeebled mine
