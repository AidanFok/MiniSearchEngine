sonnet lxxxvii

farewell  thou art too dear for my possessing 
and like enough thou know thy estimate 
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing 
my bonds in thee are all determinate 
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting 
and for that riches where is my deserving 
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting 
and so my patent back again is swerving 
thyself thou gavest  thy own worth then not knowing 
or me  to whom thou gavest it  else mistaking 
so thy great gift  upon misprision growing 
comes home again  on better judgment making 
  thus have i had thee  as a dream doth flatter 
  in sleep a king  but waking no such matter
