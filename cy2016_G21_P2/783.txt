sonnet lxxxviii

when thou shalt be disposed to set me light 
and place my merit in the eye of scorn 
upon thy side against myself i fight 
and prove thee virtuous  though thou art forsworn 
with mine own weakness being best acquainted 
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults conceal d  wherein i am attainted 
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory 
and i by this will be a gainer too 
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee 
the injuries that to myself i do 
doing thee vantage  double vantage me 
  such is my love  to thee i so belong 
  that for thy right myself will bear all wrong
