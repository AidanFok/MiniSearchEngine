those hours  that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell 
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel 
for never resting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there 
sap cheque with frost and lusty leaves quite gone 
beauty o ersnow and bareness every where 
then  were not summer distillation left 
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass 
beauty effect with beauty were bereft 
nor it nor no remembrance what it was 
  but flowers distill though they with winter meet 
  leese but their show  their substance still lives sweet
