sonnet vii

lo  in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head  each under eye
doth homage to his new appearing sight 
serving with looks his sacred majesty 
and having climb the steep up heavenly hill 
resembling strong youth in his middle age 
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still 
attending on his golden pilgrimage 
but when from highmost pitch  with weary car 
like feeble age  he reeleth from the day 
the eyes   duteous  now converted are
from his low tract and look another way 
  so thou  thyself out going in thy noon 
  unlook on diest  unless thou get a son
