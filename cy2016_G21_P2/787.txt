sonnet viii

music to hear  why hear thou music sadly 
sweets with sweets war not  joy delights in joy 
why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly 
or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy 
if the true concord of well tuned sounds 
by unions married  do offend thine ear 
they do but sweetly chide thee  who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear 
mark how one string  sweet husband to another 
strikes each in each by mutual ordering 
resembling sire and child and happy mother
who all in one  one pleasing note do sing 
  whose speechless song  being many  seeming one 
  sings this to thee   single wilt prove none
