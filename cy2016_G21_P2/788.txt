sonnet x

for shame  deny that thou bear love to any 
who for thyself art so unprovident 
grant  if thou wilt  thou art beloved of many 
but that thou none lovest is most evident 
for thou art so possess with murderous hate
that  thyself thou stick not to conspire 
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire 
o  change thy thought  that i may change my mind 
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love 
be  as thy presence is  gracious and kind 
or to thyself at least kind hearted prove 
  make thee another self  for love of me 
  that beauty still may live in thine or thee
