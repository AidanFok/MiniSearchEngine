sonnet xc

then hate me when thou wilt  if ever  now 
now  while the world is bent my deeds to cross 
join with the spite of fortune  make me bow 
and do not drop in for an after loss 
ah  do not  when my heart hath  this sorrow 
come in the rearward of a conquer woe 
give not a windy night a rainy morrow 
to linger out a purposed overthrow 
if thou wilt leave me  do not leave me last 
when other petty griefs have done their spite
but in the onset come  so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortune might 
  and other strains of woe  which now seem woe 
  compared with loss of thee will not seem so
