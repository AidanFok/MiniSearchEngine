some glory in their birth  some in their skill 
some in their wealth  some in their bodies  force 
some in their garments  though new fangled ill 
some in their hawks and hounds  some in their horse 
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure 
wherein it finds a joy above the rest 
but these particulars are not my measure 
all these i better in one general best 
thy love is better than high birth to me 
richer than wealth  prouder than garments  cost 
of more delight than hawks or horses be 
and having thee  of all men pride i boast 
  wretched in this alone  that thou mayst take
  all this away and me most wretched make
