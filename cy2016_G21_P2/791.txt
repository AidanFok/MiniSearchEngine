sonnet xcii

but do thy worst to steal thyself away 
for term of life thou art assured mine 
and life no longer than thy love will stay 
for it depends upon that love of thine 
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs 
when in the least of them my life hath end 
i see a better state to me belongs
than that which on thy humour doth depend 
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind 
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie 
o  what a happy title do i find 
happy to have thy love  happy to die 
  but what so blessed fair that fears no blot 
  thou mayst be false  and yet i know it not
