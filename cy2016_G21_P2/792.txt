sonnet xciii

so shall i live  supposing thou art true 
like a deceived husband  so love face
may still seem love to me  though alter new 
thy looks with me  thy heart in other place 
for there can live no hatred in thine eye 
therefore in that i cannot know thy change 
in many looks the false heart history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange 
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell 
whate thy thoughts or thy heart workings be 
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell 
  how like eve apple doth thy beauty grow 
  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
