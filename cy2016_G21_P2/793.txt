sonnet xciv

they that have power to hurt and will do none 
that do not do the thing they most do show 
who  moving others  are themselves as stone 
unmoved  cold  and to temptation slow 
they rightly do inherit heaven graces
and husband nature riches from expense 
they are the lords and owners of their faces 
others but stewards of their excellence 
the summer flower is to the summer sweet 
though to itself it only live and die 
but if that flower with base infection meet 
the basest weed outbraves his dignity 
  for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds 
  lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
