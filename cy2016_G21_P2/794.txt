sonnet xcix

the forward violet thus did i chide 
sweet thief  whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells 
if not from my love breath  the purple pride
which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
in my love veins thou hast too grossly dyed 
the lily i condemned for thy hand 
and buds of marjoram had stol thy hair 
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand 
one blushing shame  another white despair 
a third  nor red nor white  had stol of both
and to his robbery had annex thy breath 
but  for his theft  in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death 
  more flowers i noted  yet i none could see
  but sweet or colour it had stol from thee
