how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which  like a canker in the fragrant rose 
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name 
o  in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose 
that tongue that tells the story of thy days 
making lascivious comments on thy sport 
cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise 
naming thy name blesses an ill report 
o  what a mansion have those vices got
which for their habitation chose out thee 
where beauty veil doth cover every blot 
and all things turn to fair that eyes can see 
  take heed  dear heart  of this large privilege 
  the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge
