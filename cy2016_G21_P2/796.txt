sonnet xcvi
sonnet xcvi

some say thy fault is youth  some wantonness 
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport 
both grace and faults are loved of more and less 
thou makest faults graces that to thee resort 
as on the finger of a throned queen
the basest jewel will be well esteem d 
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated and for true things deem d 
how many lambs might the stem wolf betray 
if like a lamb he could his looks translate 
how many gazers mightst thou lead away 
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state 
  but do not so  i love thee in such sort
  as  thou being mine  mine is thy good report
