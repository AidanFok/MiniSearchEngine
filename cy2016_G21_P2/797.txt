sonnet xcvii

how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee  the pleasure of the fleeting year 
what freezings have i felt  what dark days seen 
what old december bareness every where 
and yet this time removed was summer time 
the teeming autumn  big with rich increase 
bearing the wanton burden of the prime 
like widow wombs after their lords  decease 
yet this abundant issue seem to me
but hope of orphans and unfather fruit 
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee 
and  thou away  the very birds are mute 
  or  if they sing   with so dull a cheer
  that leaves look pale  dreading the winter near
