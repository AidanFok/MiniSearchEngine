sonnet xcviii
sonnet xcviii

from you have i been absent in the spring 
when proud pied april dress in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing 
that heavy saturn laugh and leap with him 
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue
could make me any summer story tell 
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew 
nor did i wonder at the lily white 
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose 
they were but sweet  but figures of delight 
drawn after you  you pattern of all those 
  yet seem it winter still  and  you away 
  as with your shadow i with these did play
