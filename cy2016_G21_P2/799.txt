sonnet xi

as fast as thou shalt wane  so fast thou growest
in one of thine  from that which thou departest 
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest 
herein lives wisdom  beauty and increase 
without this  folly  age and cold decay 
if all were minded so  the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away 
let those whom nature hath not made for store 
harsh featureless and rude  barrenly perish 
look  whom she best endow she gave the more 
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish 
  she carved thee for her seal  and meant thereby
  thou shouldst print more  not let that copy die
