king henry iv

lords  give us leave  the prince of wales and i
must have some private conference  but be near at hand 
for we shall presently have need of you 
exeunt lords
i know not whether god will have it so 
for some displeasing service i have done 
that  in his secret doom  out of my blood
he breed revengement and a scourge for me 
but thou dost in thy passages of life
make me believe that thou art only mark 
for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
to punish my mistreadings  tell me else 
could such inordinate and low desires 
such poor  such bare  such lewd  such mean attempts 
such barren pleasures  rude society 
as thou art match withal and grafted to 
accompany the greatness of thy blood
and hold their level with thy princely heart 


prince henry

so please your majesty  i would i could
quit all offences with as clear excuse
as well as i am doubtless i can purge
myself of many i am charged withal 
yet such extenuation let me beg 
as  in reproof of many tales devised 
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear 
by smiling pick thanks and base news mongers 
i may  for some things true  wherein my youth
hath faulty wander and irregular 
find pardon on my true submission 


king henry iv

god pardon thee  yet let me wonder  harry 
at thy affections  which do hold a wing
quite from the flight of all thy ancestors 
thy place in council thou hast rudely lost 
which by thy younger brother is supplied 
and art almost an alien to the hearts
of all the court and princes of my blood 
the hope and expectation of thy time
is ruin d  and the soul of every man
prophetically doth forethink thy fall 
had i so lavish of my presence been 
so common hackney in the eyes of men 
so stale and cheap to vulgar company 
opinion  that did help me to the crown 
had still kept loyal to possession
and left me in reputeless banishment 
a fellow of no mark nor likelihood 
by being seldom seen  i could not stir
but like a comet i was wonder at 
that men would tell their children  is he 
others would say  where  which is bolingbroke 
and then i stole all courtesy from heaven 
and dress myself in such humility
that i did pluck allegiance from men hearts 
loud shouts and salutations from their mouths 
even in the presence of the crowned king 
thus did i keep my person fresh and new 
my presence  like a robe pontifical 
ne seen but wonder at  and so my state 
seldom but sumptuous  showed like a feast
and won by rareness such solemnity 
the skipping king  he ambled up and down
with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits 
soon kindled and soon burnt  carded his state 
mingled his royalty with capering fools 
had his great name profaned with their scorns
and gave his countenance  against his name 
to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
of every beardless vain comparative 
grew a companion to the common streets 
enfeoff himself to popularity 
that  being daily swallow by men eyes 
they surfeited with honey and began
to loathe the taste of sweetness  whereof a little
more than a little is by much too much 
so when he had occasion to be seen 
he was but as the cuckoo is in june 
heard  not regarded  seen  but with such eyes
as  sick and blunted with community 
afford no extraordinary gaze 
such as is bent on sun like majesty
when it shines seldom in admiring eyes 
but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down 
slept in his face and render such aspect
as cloudy men use to their adversaries 
being with his presence glutted  gorged and full 
and in that very line  harry  standest thou 
for thou has lost thy princely privilege
with vile participation  not an eye
but is a weary of thy common sight 
save mine  which hath desired to see thee more 
which now doth that i would not have it do 
make blind itself with foolish tenderness 


prince henry

i shall hereafter  my thrice gracious lord 
be more myself 


king henry iv

                  for all the world
as thou art to this hour was richard then
when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh 
and even as i was then is percy now 
now  by my sceptre and my soul to boot 
he hath more worthy interest to the state
than thou the shadow of succession 
for of no right  nor colour like to right 
he doth fill fields with harness in the realm 
turns head against the lion armed jaws 
and  being no more in debt to years than thou 
leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
to bloody battles and to bruising arms 
what never dying honour hath he got
against renowned douglas  whose high deeds 
whose hot incursions and great name in arms
holds from all soldiers chief majority
and military title capital
through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ 
thrice hath this hotspur  mars in swathling clothes 
this infant warrior  in his enterprises
discomfited great douglas  ta him once 
enlarged him and made a friend of him 
to fill the mouth of deep defiance up
and shake the peace and safety of our throne 
and what say you to this  percy  northumberland 
the archbishop grace of york  douglas  mortimer 
capitulate against us and are up 
but wherefore do i tell these news to thee 
why  harry  do i tell thee of my foes 
which art my near and dearest enemy 
thou that art like enough  through vassal fear 
base inclination and the start of spleen
to fight against me under percy pay 
to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns 
to show how much thou art degenerate 


prince henry

do not think so  you shall not find it so 
and god forgive them that so much have sway 
your majesty good thoughts away from me 
i will redeem all this on percy head
and in the closing of some glorious day
be bold to tell you that i am your son 
when i will wear a garment all of blood
and stain my favours in a bloody mask 
which  wash away  shall scour my shame with it 
and that shall be the day  whene it lights 
that this same child of honour and renown 
this gallant hotspur  this all praised knight 
and your unthought of harry chance to meet 
for every honour sitting on his helm 
would they were multitudes  and on my head
my shames redoubled  for the time will come 
that i shall make this northern youth exchange
his glorious deeds for my indignities 
percy is but my factor  good my lord 
to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf 
and i will call him to so strict account 
that he shall render every glory up 
yea  even the slightest worship of his time 
or i will tear the reckoning from his heart 
this  in the name of god  i promise here 
the which if he be pleased i shall perform 
i do beseech your majesty may salve
the long grown wounds of my intemperance 
if not  the end of life cancels all bands 
and i will die a hundred thousand deaths
ere break the smallest parcel of this vow 


king henry iv

a hundred thousand rebels die in this 
thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein 
enter blunt
how now  good blunt  thy looks are full of speed 


sir walter blunt

so hath the business that i come to speak of 
lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word
that douglas and the english rebels met
the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury
a mighty and a fearful head they are 
if promises be kept on every hand 
as ever offer foul play in the state 


king henry iv

the earl of westmoreland set forth to day 
with him my son  lord john of lancaster 
for this advertisement is five days old 
on wednesday next  harry  you shall set forward 
on thursday we ourselves will march  our meeting
is bridgenorth  and  harry  you shall march
through gloucestershire  by which account 
our business valued  some twelve days hence
our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet 
our hands are full of business  let away 
advantage feeds him fat  while men delay

action  do i not bate  do i not dwindle  why my
skin hangs about me like an like an old lady loose
gown  i am withered like an old apple john  well

liking  i shall be out of heart shortly  and then i
shall have no strength to repent  an i have not
forgotten what the inside of a church is made of  i
am a peppercorn  a brewer horse  the inside of a
church  company  villanous company  hath been the
spoil of me 


bardolph

me merry  i was as virtuously given as a gentleman
need to be  virtuous enough  swore little  diced not
above seven times a week  went to a bawdy house once
in a quarter of an hour  paid money that i
borrowed  three of four times  lived well and in
good compass  and now i live out of all order  out

knight of the burning lamp

falstaff

no  i be sworn  i make as good use of it as many
a man doth of a death s head or a memento mori  i
never see thy face but i think upon hell fire and
dives that lived in purple  for there he is in his
robes  burning  burning  if thou wert any way
given to virtue  i would swear by thy face  my oath
should be  this fire  that god angel  but
thou art altogether given over  and wert indeed  but
for the light in thy face  the son of utter
darkness  when thou rannest up gadshill in the
night to catch my horse  if i did not think thou
hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire 
there no purchase in money  o  thou art a
perpetual triumph  an everlasting bonfire light 
thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
torches  walking with thee in the night betwixt
tavern and tavern  but the sack that thou hast
drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
at the dearest chandler in europe  i have
maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
time this two and thirty years  god reward me for
it
