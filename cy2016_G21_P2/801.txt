sonnet xiii

o  that you were yourself  but  love  you are
no longer yours than you yourself here live 
against this coming end you should prepare 
and your sweet semblance to some other give 
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination  then you were
yourself again after yourself decease 
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear 
who lets so fair a house fall to decay 
which husbandry in honour might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winter day
and barren rage of death eternal cold 
  o  none but unthrifts  dear my love  you know
  you had a father  let your son say so
