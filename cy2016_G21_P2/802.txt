sonnet xiv

not from the stars do i my judgment pluck 
and yet methinks i have astronomy 
but not to tell of good or evil luck 
of plagues  of dearths  or seasons  quality 
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell 
pointing to each his thunder  rain and wind 
or say with princes if it shall go well 
by oft predict that i in heaven find 
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive 
and  constant stars  in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive 
if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert 
  or else of thee this i prognosticate 
  thy end is truth and beauty doom and date
