sonnet xix

devouring time  blunt thou the lion paws 
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood 
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger jaws 
and burn the long lived phoenix in her blood 
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets 
and do whate thou wilt  swift footed time 
to the wide world and all her fading sweets 
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime 
o  carve not with thy hours my love fair brow 
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen 
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beauty pattern to succeeding men 
  yet  do thy worst  old time  despite thy wrong 
  my love shall in my verse ever live young
