sonnet xli

those petty wrongs that liberty commits 
when i am sometime absent from thy heart 
thy beauty and thy years full well befits 
for still temptation follows where thou art 
gentle thou art and therefore to be won 
beauteous thou art  therefore to be assailed 
and when a woman woos  what woman son
will sourly leave her till she have prevailed 
ay me  but yet thou mightest my seat forbear 
and chide try beauty and thy straying youth 
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth 
  hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee 
  thine  by thy beauty being false to me
