sonnet xlii
sonnet xlii

that thou hast her  it is not all my grief 
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly 
that she hath thee  is of my wailing chief 
a loss in love that touches me more nearly 
loving offenders  thus i will excuse ye 
thou dost love her  because thou knowst i love her 
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me 
suffering my friend for my sake to approve her 
if i lose thee  my loss is my love gain 
and losing her  my friend hath found that loss 
both find each other  and i lose both twain 
and both for my sake lay on me this cross 
  but here the joy  my friend and i are one 
  sweet flattery  then she loves but me alone
