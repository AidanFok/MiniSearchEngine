sonnet xlvi
sonnet xlvi

mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight 
mine eye my heart thy picture sight would bar 
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right 
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie 
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes 
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies 
to  this title is impanneled
a quest of thoughts  all tenants to the heart 
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eye moiety and the dear heart part 
  as thus  mine eye due is thy outward part 
  and my heart right thy inward love of heart
