sonnet xlvii
sonnet xlvii

betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took 
and each doth good turns now unto the other 
when that mine eye is famish for a look 
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother 
with my love picture then my eye doth feast
and to the painted banquet bids my heart 
another time mine eye is my heart guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part 
so  either by thy picture or my love 
thyself away art resent still with me 
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move 
and i am still with them and they with thee 
  or  if they sleep  thy picture in my sight
  awakes my heart to heart and eye delight
