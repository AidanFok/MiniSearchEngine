sonnet xlviii

how careful was i  when i took my way 
each trifle under truest bars to thrust 
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood  in sure wards of trust 
but thou  to whom my jewels trifles are 
most worthy of comfort  now my greatest grief 
thou  best of dearest and mine only care 
art left the prey of every vulgar thief 
thee have i not lock up in any chest 
save where thou art not  though i feel thou art 
within the gentle closure of my breast 
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part 
  and even thence thou wilt be stol n  i fear 
  for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
