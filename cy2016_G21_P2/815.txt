sonnet xvi

but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant  time 
and fortify yourself in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme 
now stand you on the top of happy hours 
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear your living flowers 
much liker than your painted counterfeit 
so should the lines of life that life repair 
which this  time pencil  or my pupil pen 
neither in inward worth nor outward fair 
can make you live yourself in eyes of men 
  to give away yourself keeps yourself still 
  and you must live  drawn by your own sweet skill
