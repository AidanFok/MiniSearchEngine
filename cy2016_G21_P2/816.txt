sonnet xvii

who will believe my verse in time to come 
if it were fill with your most high deserts 
though yet  heaven knows  it is but as a tomb
which hides your life and shows not half your parts 
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces 
the age to come would say  poet lies 
such heavenly touches ne touch earthly faces 
so should my papers yellow with their age
be scorn like old men of less truth than tongue 
and your true rights be term a poet rage
and stretched metre of an antique song 
  but were some child of yours alive that time 
  you should live twice  in it and in my rhyme
