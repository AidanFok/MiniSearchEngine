sonnet xx

a woman face with nature own hand painted
hast thou  the master mistress of my passion 
a woman gentle heart  but not acquainted
with shifting change  as is false women fashion 
an eye more bright than theirs  less false in rolling 
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth 
a man in hue  all  hues  in his controlling 
much steals men eyes and women souls amazeth 
and for a woman wert thou first created 
till nature  as she wrought thee  fell a doting 
and by addition me of thee defeated 
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing 
  but since she prick thee out for women pleasure 
  mine be thy love and thy love use their treasure
