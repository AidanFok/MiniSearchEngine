sonnet xxi

so is it not with me as with that muse
stirr by a painted beauty to his verse 
who heaven itself for ornament doth use
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
making a couplement of proud compare 
with sun and moon  with earth and sea rich gems 
with april first born flowers  and all things rare
that heaven air in this huge rondure hems 
o  let me  true in love  but truly write 
and then believe me  my love is as fair
as any mother child  though not so bright
as those gold candles fix in heaven air 
  let them say more than like of hearsay well 
  i will not praise that purpose not to sell
