sonnet xxiii
sonnet xxiii

as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put besides his part 
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage 
whose strength abundance weakens his own heart 
so i  for fear of trust  forget to say
the perfect ceremony of love rite 
and in mine own love strength seem to decay 
o with burden of mine own love might 
o  let my books be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast 
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more express d 
  o  learn to read what silent love hath writ 
  to hear with eyes belongs to love fine wit
