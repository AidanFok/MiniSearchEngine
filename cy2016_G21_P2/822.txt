sonnet xxiv
sonnet xxiv

mine eye hath play the painter and hath stell 
thy beauty form in table of my heart 
my body is the frame wherein  held 
and perspective it is the painter art 
for through the painter must you see his skill 
to find where your true image pictured lies 
which in my bosom shop is hanging still 
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes 
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done 
mine eyes have drawn thy shape  and thine for me
are windows to my breast  where through the sun
delights to peep  to gaze therein on thee 
  yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art 
  they draw but what they see  know not the heart
