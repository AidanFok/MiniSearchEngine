sonnet xxix
sonnet xxix

when  in disgrace with fortune and men eyes 
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon myself and curse my fate 
wishing me like to one more rich in hope 
featured like him  like him with friends possess d 
desiring this man art and that man scope 
with what i most enjoy contented least 
yet in these thoughts myself almost despising 
haply i think on thee  and then my state 
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth  sings hymns at heaven gate 
  for thy sweet love remember such wealth brings
  that then i scorn to change my state with kings
