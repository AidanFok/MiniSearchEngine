sonnet xxviii

how can i then return in happy plight 
that am debarr the benefit of rest 
when day oppression is not eased by night 
but day by night  and night by day  oppress d 
and each  though enemies to either reign 
do in consent shake hands to torture me 
the one by toil  the other to complain
how far i toil  still farther off from thee 
i tell the day  to please them thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven 
so flatter i the swart complexion night 
when sparkling stars twire not thou gild the even 
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
  and night doth nightly make grief strength
  	seem stronger
