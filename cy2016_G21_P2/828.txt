sonnet xxx

when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past 
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought 
and with old woes new wail my dear time waste 
then can i drown an eye  unused to flow 
for precious friends hid in death dateless night 
and weep afresh love long since cancell woe 
and moan the expense of many a vanish sight 
then can i grieve at grievances foregone 
and heavily from woe to woe tell o 
the sad account of fore bemoaned moan 
which i new pay as if not paid before 
  but if the while i think on thee  dear friend 
  all losses are restored and sorrows end
