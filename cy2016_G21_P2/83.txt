a verb  and such abominable words as no christian
ear can endure to hear  thou hast appointed
justices of peace  to call poor men before them
about matters they were not able to answer

prayers and tears have moved me  gifts could never 
when have i aught exacted at your hands 
but to maintain the king  the realm and you 
large gifts have i bestow on learned clerks 
because my book preferr me to the king 
and seeing ignorance is the curse of god

this breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts

pleading so well for his life  away with him  he
has a familiar under his tongue  he speaks not o

them again  lest they consult about the giving up of
some more towns in france  soldiers  defer the
spoil of the city until night  for with these borne
before us  instead of maces  will we ride through
the streets  and at every corner have them kiss  away
