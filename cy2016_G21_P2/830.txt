sonnet xxxii
sonnet xxxii

if thou survive my well contented day 
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover 
and shalt by fortune once more re survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover 
compare them with the bettering of the time 
and though they be outstripp by every pen 
reserve them for my love  not for their rhyme 
exceeded by the height of happier men 
o  then vouchsafe me but this loving thought 
 my friend muse grown with this growing age 
a dearer birth than this his love had brought 
to march in ranks of better equipage 
  but since he died and poets better prove 
  theirs for their style i read  his for his love
