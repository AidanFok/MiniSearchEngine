scene viii  southwark 


alarum and retreat  enter cade and all his rabblement


cade

up fish street  down saint magnus  corner  kill
and knock down  throw them into thames 
sound a parley
what noise is this i hear  dare any be so bold to
sound retreat or parley  when i command them kill 
enter buckingham and clifford  attended


buckingham

ay  here they be that dare and will disturb thee 
know  cade  we come ambassadors from the king
unto the commons whom thou hast misled 
and here pronounce free pardon to them all
that will forsake thee and go home in peace 


clifford

what say ye  countrymen  will ye relent 
and yield to mercy whilst  offer you 
or let a rebel lead you to your deaths 
who loves the king and will embrace his pardon 
fling up his cap  and say  save his majesty 
who hateth him and honours not his father 
henry the fifth  that made all france to quake 
shake he his weapon at us and pass by 


all

god save the king  god save the king 


cade

what  buckingham and clifford  are ye so brave  and
you  base peasants  do ye believe him  will you
needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks 
hath my sword therefore broke through london gates 
that you should leave me at the white hart in
southwark  i thought ye would never have given out
these arms till you had recovered your ancient
freedom  but you are all recreants and dastards 
and delight to live in slavery to the nobility  let
them break your backs with burthens  take your
houses over your heads  ravish your wives and
daughters before your faces  for me  i will make
shift for one  and so  god curse light upon you
all 


all

we follow cade  we follow cade 


clifford

is cade the son of henry the fifth 
that thus you do exclaim you go with him 
will he conduct you through the heart of france 
and make the meanest of you earls and dukes 
alas  he hath no home  no place to fly to 
nor knows he how to live but by the spoil 
unless by robbing of your friends and us 
were not a shame  that whilst you live at jar 
the fearful french  whom you late vanquished 
should make a start o seas and vanquish you 
methinks already in this civil broil
i see them lording it in london streets 
crying  villiago  unto all they meet 
better ten thousand base born cades miscarry
than you should stoop unto a frenchman mercy 
to france  to france  and get what you have lost 
spare england  for it is your native coast 
henry hath money  you are strong and manly 
god on our side  doubt not of victory 


all

a clifford  a clifford  we follow the king and clifford 


cade

was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this
multitude  the name of henry the fifth hales them
to an hundred mischiefs  and makes them leave me
desolate  i see them lay their heads together to
surprise me  my sword make way for me  for here is
no staying  in despite of the devils and hell  have
through the very middest of you  and heavens and
honour be witness  that no want of resolution in me 
but only my followers  base and ignominious
treasons  makes me betake me to my heels 
exit


buckingham

what  is he fled  go some  and follow him 
and he that brings his head unto the king
shall have a thousand crowns for his reward 
exeunt some of them
follow me  soldiers  we devise a mean
to reconcile you all unto the king 
exeunt
