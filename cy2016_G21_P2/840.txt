lucentio

tranio  since for the great desire i had
to see fair padua  nursery of arts 
i am arrived for fruitful lombardy 
the pleasant garden of great italy 
and by my father love and leave am arm 
with his good will and thy good company 
my trusty servant  well approved in all 
here let us breathe and haply institute
a course of learning and ingenious studies 
pisa renown for grave citizens
gave me my being and my father first 
a merchant of great traffic through the world 
vincetino come of bentivolii 
vincetino son brought up in florence
it shall become to serve all hopes conceived 
to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds 
and therefore  tranio  for the time i study 
virtue and that part of philosophy
will i apply that treats of happiness
by virtue specially to be achieved 
tell me thy mind  for i have pisa left
and am to padua come  as he that leaves
a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst 


tranio

mi perdonato  gentle master mine 
i am in all affected as yourself 
glad that you thus continue your resolve
to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy 
only  good master  while we do admire
this virtue and this moral discipline 
let be no stoics nor no stocks  i pray 
or so devote to aristotle cheques
as ovid be an outcast quite abjured 
balk logic with acquaintance that you have
and practise rhetoric in your common talk 
music and poesy use to quicken you 
the mathematics and the metaphysics 
fall to them as you find your stomach serves you 
no profit grows where is no pleasure ta en 
in brief  sir  study what you most affect 


lucentio

gramercies  tranio  well dost thou advise 
if  biondello  thou wert come ashore 
we could at once put us in readiness 
and take a lodging fit to entertain
such friends as time in padua shall beget 
but stay a while  what company is this

unless you were of gentler  milder mould 


katharina

i faith  sir  you shall never need to fear 
i wis it is not half way to her heart 
but if it were  doubt not her care should be
to comb your noddle with a three legg stool
and paint your face and use you like a fool 


hortensia

gremio

and make her bear the penance of her tongue 


baptista

together  and fast it fairly out  our cakes dough on
both sides  farewell  yet for the love i bear my
sweet bianca  if i can by any means light on a fit
man to teach her that wherein she delights  i will
wish him to her father

though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle  know now  upon advice  it toucheth us both 
that we may yet again have access to our fair
mistress and be happy rivals in bianco love  to
labour and effect one thing specially

gremio

a husband  a devil 


hortensio

i say  a husband 


gremio

i say  a devil  thinkest thou  hortensio  though
her father be very rich  any man is so very a fool
to be married to hell 


hortensio

tush  gremio  though it pass your patience and mine
to endure her loud alarums  why  man  there be good
fellows in the world  an a man could light on them 
would take her with all faults  and money enough 


gremio

i cannot tell  but i had as lief take her dowry with
this condition  to be whipped at the high cross
every morning 


hortensio

faith  as you say  there small choice in rotten
apples  but come  since this bar in law makes us
friends  it shall be so far forth friendly
maintained all by helping baptista eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband 
and then have to a fresh  sweet bianca  happy man
be his dole  he that runs fastest gets the ring 
how say you  signior gremio 


gremio

i am agreed  and would i had given him the best
horse in padua to begin his wooing that would
thoroughly woo her  wed her and bed her and rid the
house of her  come on 
exeunt gremio and hortensio


tranio

i pray  sir  tell me  is it possible
that love should of a sudden take such hold 


lucentio

o tranio  till i found it to be true 
i never thought it possible or likely 
but see  while idly i stood looking on 
i found the effect of love in idleness 
and now in plainness do confess to thee 
that art to me as secret and as dear
as anna to the queen of carthage was 
tranio  i burn  i pine  i perish  tranio 
if i achieve not this young modest girl 
counsel me  tranio  for i know thou canst 
assist me  tranio  for i know thou wilt 


tranio

master  it is no time to chide you now 
affection is not rated from the heart 
if love have touch you  nought remains but so 
 te captum quam queas minimo 


lucentio

gramercies  lad  go forward  this contents 
the rest will comfort  for thy counsel sound 


tranio

master  you look so longly on the maid 
perhaps you mark not what the pith of all 


lucentio

o yes  i saw sweet beauty in her face 
such as the daughter of agenor had 
that made great jove to humble him to her hand 
when with his knees he kiss the cretan strand 


tranio

saw you no more  mark you not how her sister
began to scold and raise up such a storm
that mortal ears might hardly endure the din 


lucentio

tranio  i saw her coral lips to move
and with her breath she did perfume the air 
sacred and sweet was all i saw in her 


tranio

nay  then   time to stir him from his trance 
i pray  awake  sir  if you love the maid 
bend thoughts and wits to achieve her  thus it stands 
her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
that till the father rid his hands of her 
master  your love must live a maid at home 
and therefore has he closely mew her up 
because she will not be annoy with suitors 


lucentio

ah  tranio  what a cruel father he 
but art thou not advised  he took some care
to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her 


tranio

ay  marry  am i  sir  and now  plotted 


lucentio

i have it  tranio 


tranio

                  master  for my hand 
both our inventions meet and jump in one 


lucentio

tell me thine first 


tranio

you will be schoolmaster
and undertake the teaching of the maid 
that your device 


lucentio

it is  may it be done 


tranio

not possible  for who shall bear your part 
and be in padua here vincentio son 
keep house and ply his book  welcome his friends 
visit his countrymen and banquet them 


lucentio

basta  content thee  for i have it full 
we have not yet been seen in any house 
nor can we lie distinguish by our faces
for man or master  then it follows thus 
thou shalt be master  tranio  in my stead 
keep house and port and servants as i should 
i will some other be  some florentine 
some neapolitan  or meaner man of pisa 
 hatch and shall be so  tranio  at once
uncase thee  take my colour hat and cloak 
when biondello comes  he waits on thee 
but i will charm him first to keep his tongue 


tranio

so had you need 
in brief  sir  sith it your pleasure is 
and i am tied to be obedient 
for so your father charged me at our parting 
 serviceable to my son  quoth he 
although i think  in another sense 
i am content to be lucentio 
because so well i love lucentio 


lucentio

tranio  be so  because lucentio loves 
and let me be a slave  to achieve that maid
whose sudden sight hath thrall my wounded eye 
here comes the rogue 
enter biondello
sirrah  where have you been 


biondello

where have i been  nay  how now  where are you 
master  has my fellow tranio stolen your clothes  or
you stolen his  or both  pray  what the news 


lucentio

sirrah  come hither   no time to jest 
and therefore frame your manners to the time 
your fellow tranio here  to save my life 
puts my apparel and my countenance on 
and i for my escape have put on his 
for in a quarrel since i came ashore
i kill a man and fear i was descried 
wait you on him  i charge you  as becomes 
while i make way from hence to save my life 
you understand me 


biondello

                  i  sir  ne a whit 


lucentio

and not a jot of tranio in your mouth 
tranio is changed into lucentio 


biondello

the better for him  would i were so too 


tranio

so could i  faith  boy  to have the next wish after 
that lucentio indeed had baptista youngest daughter 
but  sirrah  not for my sake  but your master s  i advise
you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies 
when i am alone  why  then i am tranio 
but in all places else your master lucentio

and weighty
