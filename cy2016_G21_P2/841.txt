hortensio

 nostra casa ben venuto  molto honorato signor
mio petruchio  rise  grumio  rise  we will compound
this quarrel 


grumio

nay   no matter  sir  what he  in latin 
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
service  look you  sir  he bid me knock him and rap
him soundly  sir  well  was it fit for a servant to
use his master so  being perhaps  for aught i see 
two and thirty  a pip out  whom would to god i had
well knock at first  then had not grumio come by the worst 


petruchio

a senseless villain  good hortensio 
i bade the rascal knock upon your gate
and could not get him for my heart to do it 


grumio

knock at the gate  o heavens  spake you not these
words plain   sirrah  knock me here  rap me here 
knock me well  and knock me soundly  and come you
now with   at the gate 


petruchio

sirrah  be gone  or talk not  i advise you 


hortensio

petruchio  patience  i am grumio pledge 
why  this a heavy chance  him and you 
your ancient  trusty  pleasant servant grumio 
and tell me now  sweet friend  what happy gale
blows you to padua here from old verona 


petruchio

such wind as scatters young men through the world 
to seek their fortunes farther than at home
where small experience grows  but in a few 
signior hortensio  thus it stands with me 
antonio  my father  is deceased 
and i have thrust myself into this maze 
haply to wive and thrive as best i may 
crowns in my purse i have and goods at home 
and so am come abroad to see the world 


hortensio

petruchio  shall i then come roundly to thee
and wish thee to a shrewd ill favour wife 
thou thank me but a little for my counsel 
and yet i promise thee she shall be rich
and very rich  but thou too much my friend 
and i not wish thee to her 


petruchio

signior hortensio   such friends as we
few words suffice  and therefore  if thou know
one rich enough to be petruchio wife 
as wealth is burden of my wooing dance 
be she as foul as was florentius  love 
as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd
as socrates  xanthippe  or a worse 
she moves me not  or not removes  at least 
affection edge in me  were she as rough
as are the swelling adriatic seas 
i come to wive it wealthily in padua 
if wealthily  then happily in padua 


grumio

nay  look you  sir  he tells you flatly what his
mind is  why give him gold enough and marry him to
a puppet or an aglet baby  or an old trot with ne 
a tooth in her head  though she have as many diseases
as two and fifty horses  why  nothing comes amiss 
so money comes withal 


hortensio

petruchio  since we are stepp thus far in 
i will continue that i broach in jest 
i can  petruchio  help thee to a wife
with wealth enough and young and beauteous 
brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman 
her only fault  and that is faults enough 
is that she is intolerable curst
and shrewd and froward  so beyond all measure
that  were my state far worser than it is 
i would not wed her for a mine of gold 


petruchio

hortensio  peace  thou know not gold effect 
tell me her father name and  enough 
for i will board her  though she chide as loud
as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack 


hortensio

her father is baptista minola 
an affable and courteous gentleman 
her name is katharina minola 
renown in padua for her scolding tongue 


petruchio

i know her father  though i know not her 
and he knew my deceased father well 
i will not sleep  hortensio  till i see her 
and therefore let me be thus bold with you
to give you over at this first encounter 
unless you will accompany me thither 


grumio

i pray you  sir  let him go while the humour lasts 
o  my word  an she knew him as well as i do  she
would think scolding would do little good upon him 
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so 
why  that nothing  an he begin once  he rail in
his rope tricks  i tell you what sir  an she
stand him but a little  he will throw a figure in
her face and so disfigure her with it that she
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat 
you know him not  sir 


hortensio

tarry  petruchio  i must go with thee 
for in baptista keep my treasure is 
he hath the jewel of my life in hold 
his youngest daughter  beautiful binaca 
and her withholds from me and other more 
suitors to her and rivals in my love 
supposing it a thing impossible 
for those defects i have before rehearsed 
that ever katharina will be woo d 
therefore this order hath baptista ta en 
that none shall have access unto bianca
till katharina the curst have got a husband 


grumio

katharina the curst 
a title for a maid of all titles the worst 


hortensio

now shall my friend petruchio do me grace 
and offer me disguised in sober robes
to old baptista as a schoolmaster
well seen in music  to instruct bianca 
that so i may  by this device  at least
have leave and leisure to make love to her
and unsuspected court her by herself 


grumio

here no knavery  see  to beguile the old folks 
how the young folks lay their heads together 
enter gremio  and lucentio disguised
master  master  look about you  who goes there  ha 


hortensio

peace  grumio  it is the rival of my love 
petruchio  stand by a while 


grumio

a proper stripling and an amorous 


gremio

o  very well  i have perused the note 
hark you  sir  i have them very fairly bound 
all books of love  see that at any hand 
and see you read no other lectures to her 
you understand me  over and beside
signior baptista liberality 
i mend it with a largess  take your paper too 
and let me have them very well perfumed
for she is sweeter than perfume itself
to whom they go to  what will you read to her 


lucentio

whate i read to her  i plead for you
as for my patron  stand you so assured 
as firmly as yourself were still in place 
yea  and perhaps with more successful words
than you  unless you were a scholar  sir 


gremio

o this learning  what a thing it is 


grumio

o this woodcock  what an ass it is 


petruchio

peace  sirrah 


hortensio

grumio  mum  god save you  signior gremio 


gremio

and you are well met  signior hortensio 
trow you whither i am going  to baptista minola 
i promised to inquire carefully
about a schoolmaster for the fair bianca 
and by good fortune i have lighted well
on this young man  for learning and behavior
fit for her turn  well read in poetry
and other books  good ones  i warrant ye 


hortensio

 well  and i have met a gentleman
hath promised me to help me to another 
a fine musician to instruct our mistress 
so shall i no whit be behind in duty
to fair bianca  so beloved of me 


gremio

beloved of me  and that my deeds shall prove 


grumio

and that his bags shall prove 


hortensio

gremio   now no time to vent our love 
listen to me  and if you speak me fair 
i tell you news indifferent good for either 
here is a gentleman whom by chance i met 
upon agreement from us to his liking 
will undertake to woo curst katharina 
yea  and to marry her  if her dowry please 


gremio

so said  so done  is well 
hortensio  have you told him all her faults 


petruchio

i know she is an irksome brawling scold 
if that be all  masters  i hear no harm 


gremio

no  say me so  friend  what countryman 


petruchio

born in verona  old antonio son 
my father dead  my fortune lives for me 
and i do hope good days and long to see 


gremio

o sir  such a life  with such a wife  were strange 
but if you have a stomach  to i  god name 
you shall have me assisting you in all 
but will you woo this wild cat 


petruchio

will i live 


grumio

will he woo her  ay  or i hang her 


petruchio

why came i hither but to that intent 
think you a little din can daunt mine ears 
have i not in my time heard lions roar 
have i not heard the sea puff up with winds
rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat 
have i not heard great ordnance in the field 
and heaven artillery thunder in the skies 
have i not in a pitched battle heard
loud  larums  neighing steeds  and trumpets  clang 
and do you tell me of a woman tongue 
that gives not half so great a blow to hear
as will a chestnut in a farmer fire 
tush  tush  fear boys with bugs 


grumio

for he fears none 


gremio

hortensio  hark 
this gentleman is happily arrived 
my mind presumes  for his own good and ours 


hortensio

i promised we would be contributors
and bear his charging of wooing  whatsoe er 


gremio

and so we will  provided that he win her 


grumio

i would i were as sure of a good dinner 
enter tranio brave  and biondello


tranio

gentlemen  god save you  if i may be bold 
tell me  i beseech you  which is the readiest way
to the house of signior baptista minola 


biondello

he that has the two fair daughters  is he you mean 


tranio

even he  biondello 


gremio

hark you  sir  you mean not her to 


tranio

perhaps  him and her  sir  what have you to do 


petruchio

not her that chides  sir  at any hand  i pray 


tranio

i love no chiders  sir  biondello  let away 


lucentio

well begun  tranio 


hortensio

sir  a word ere you go 
are you a suitor to the maid you talk of  yea or no 


tranio

and if i be  sir  is it any offence 


gremio

no  if without more words you will get you hence 


tranio

why  sir  i pray  are not the streets as free
for me as for you 


gremio

                  but so is not she 


tranio

for what reason  i beseech you 


gremio

for this reason  if you know 
that she the choice love of signior gremio 


hortensio

that she the chosen of signior hortensio 


tranio

softly  my masters  if you be gentlemen 
do me this right  hear me with patience 
baptista is a noble gentleman 
to whom my father is not all unknown 
and were his daughter fairer than she is 
she may more suitors have and me for one 
fair leda daughter had a thousand wooers 
then well one more may fair bianca have 
and so she shall  lucentio shall make one 
though paris came in hope to speed alone 


gremio

what  this gentleman will out talk us all 


lucentio

sir  give him head  i know he prove a jade 


petruchio

hortensio  to what end are all these words 


hortensio

sir  let me be so bold as ask you 
did you yet ever see baptista daughter 


tranio

no  sir  but hear i do that he hath two 
the one as famous for a scolding tongue
as is the other for beauteous modesty 


petruchio

sir  sir  the first for me  let her go by 


gremio

yea  leave that labour to great hercules 
and let it be more than alcides  twelve 


petruchio

sir  understand you this of me in sooth 
the younges t daughter whom you hearken for
her father keeps from all access of suitors 
and will not promise her to any man
until the elder sister first be wed 
the younger then is free and not before 


tranio

if it be so  sir  that you are the man
must stead us all and me amongst the rest 
and if you break the ice and do this feat 
achieve the elder  set the younger free
for our access  whose hap shall be to have her
will not so graceless be to be ingrate 


hortensio

sir  you say well and well you do conceive 
and since you do profess to be a suitor 
you must  as we do  gratify this gentleman 
to whom we all rest generally beholding 


tranio

sir  i shall not be slack  in sign whereof 
please ye we may contrive this afternoon 
and quaff carouses to our mistress  health 
and do as adversaries do in law 
strive mightily  but eat and drink as friends 


grumio

biondello

o excellent motion  fellows  let be gone 


hortensio

the motion good indeed and be it so 
petruchio  i shall be your ben venuto 
exeunt
