petruchio

you wrong me  signior gremio  give me leave 
i am a gentleman of verona  sir 
that  hearing of her beauty and her wit 
her affability and bashful modesty 
her wondrous qualities and mild behavior 
am bold to show myself a forward guest
within your house  to make mine eye the witness
of that report which i so oft have heard 
and  for an entrance to my entertainment 
i do present you with a man of mine 
presenting hortensio
cunning in music and the mathematics 
to instruct her fully in those sciences 
whereof i know she is not ignorant 
accept of him  or else you do me wrong 
his name is licio  born in mantua 


baptista

you welcome  sir  and he  for your good sake 
but for my daughter katharina  this i know 
she is not for your turn  the more my grief 


petruchio

i see you do not mean to part with her 
or else you like not of my company 


baptista

mistake me not  i speak but as i find 
whence are you  sir  what may i call your name 


petruchio

petruchio is my name  antonio son 
a man well known throughout all italy 


baptista

i know him well  you are welcome for his sake 


gremio

saving your tale  petruchio  i pray 
let us  that are poor petitioners  speak too 
baccare  you are marvellous forward 


petruchio

o  pardon me  signior gremio  i would fain be doing 


gremio

i doubt it not  sir  but you will curse your
wooing  neighbour  this is a gift very grateful  i am
sure of it  to express the like kindness  myself 
that have been more kindly beholding to you than
any  freely give unto you this young scholar 
presenting lucentio
that hath been long studying at rheims  as cunning
in greek  latin  and other languages  as the other
in music and mathematics  his name is cambio  pray 
accept his service 


baptista

a thousand thanks  signior gremio 
welcome  good cambio 
to tranio
but  gentle sir  methinks you walk like a stranger 
may i be so bold to know the cause of your coming 


tranio

pardon me  sir  the boldness is mine own 
that  being a stranger in this city here 
do make myself a suitor to your daughter 
unto bianca  fair and virtuous 
nor is your firm resolve unknown to me 
in the preferment of the eldest sister 
this liberty is all that i request 
that  upon knowledge of my parentage 
i may have welcome  the rest that woo
and free access and favour as the rest 
and  toward the education of your daughters 
i here bestow a simple instrument 
and this small packet of greek and latin books 
if you accept them  then their worth is great 


baptista

lucentio is your name  of whence  i pray 


tranio

of pisa  sir  son to vincentio 


baptista

a mighty man of pisa  by report
i know him well  you are very welcome  sir 
take you the lute  and you the set of books 
you shall go see your pupils presently 
holla  within 
enter a servant
sirrah  lead these gentlemen
to my daughters  and tell them both 
these are their tutors  bid them use them well 
exit servant  with lucentio and hortensio  biondello following
we will go walk a little in the orchard 
and then to dinner  you are passing welcome 
and so i pray you all to think yourselves 


petruchio

signior baptista  my business asketh haste 
and every day i cannot come to woo 
you knew my father well  and in him me 
left solely heir to all his lands and goods 
which i have better rather than decreased 
then tell me  if i get your daughter love 
what dowry shall i have with her to wife 


baptista

after my death the one half of my lands 
and in possession twenty thousand crowns 


petruchio

and  for that dowry  i assure her of
her widowhood  be it that she survive me 
in all my lands and leases whatsoever 
let specialties be therefore drawn between us 
that covenants may be kept on either hand 


baptista

ay  when the special thing is well obtain d 
that is  her love  for that is all in all 


petruchio

why  that is nothing  for i tell you  father 
i am as peremptory as she proud minded 
and where two raging fires meet together
they do consume the thing that feeds their fury 
though little fire grows great with little wind 
yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all 
so i to her and so she yields to me 
for i am rough and woo not like a babe 


baptista

well mayst thou woo  and happy be thy speed 
but be thou arm for some unhappy words 


petruchio

ay  to the proof  as mountains are for winds 
that shake not  though they blow perpetually 
re enter hortensio  with his head broke


baptista

how now  my friend  why dost thou look so pale 


hortensio

for fear  i promise you  if i look pale 


baptista

what  will my daughter prove a good musician 


hortensio

i think she sooner prove a soldier
iron may hold with her  but never lutes 


baptista

why  then thou canst not break her to the lute 


hortensio

why  no  for she hath broke the lute to me 
i did but tell her she mistook her frets 
and bow her hand to teach her fingering 
when  with a most impatient devilish spirit 
 frets  call you these  quoth she   i fume
with them 
and  with that word  she struck me on the head 
and through the instrument my pate made way 
and there i stood amazed for a while 
as on a pillory  looking through the lute 
while she did call me rascal fiddler
and twangling jack  with twenty such vile terms 
as had she studied to misuse me so 


petruchio

now  by the world  it is a lusty wench 
i love her ten times more than e i did 
o  how i long to have some chat with her 


baptista

well  go with me and be not so discomfited 
proceed in practise with my younger daughter 
she apt to learn and thankful for good turns 
signior petruchio  will you go with us 
or shall i send my daughter kate to you 


petruchio

i pray you do 
exeunt all but petruchio
i will attend her here 
and woo her with some spirit when she comes 
say that she rail  why then i tell her plain
she sings as sweetly as a nightingale 
say that she frown  i say she looks as clear
as morning roses newly wash with dew 
say she be mute and will not speak a word 
then i commend her volubility 
and say she uttereth piercing eloquence 
if she do bid me pack  i give her thanks 
as though she bid me stay by her a week 
if she deny to wed  i crave the day
when i shall ask the banns and when be married 
but here she comes  and now  petruchio  speak 
enter katharina
good morrow  kate  for that your name  i hear 


katharina

well have you heard  but something hard of hearing 
they call me katharina that do talk of me 


petruchio

you lie  in faith  for you are call plain kate 
and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst 
but kate  the prettiest kate in christendom
kate of kate hall  my super dainty kate 
for dainties are all kates  and therefore  kate 
take this of me  kate of my consolation 
hearing thy mildness praised in every town 
thy virtues spoke of  and thy beauty sounded 
yet not so deeply as to thee belongs 
myself am moved to woo thee for my wife 


katharina

moved  in good time  let him that moved you hither
remove you hence  i knew you at the first
you were a moveable 


petruchio

petruchio

thou hast hit it  come  sit on me 


katharina

asses are made to bear  and so are you 


petruchio

women are made to bear  and so are you 


katharina

no such jade as you  if me you mean 


petruchio

alas  good kate  i will not burden thee 
for  knowing thee to be but young and light 


katharina

too light for such a swain as you to catch 
and yet as heavy as my weight should be 


petruchio

should be  should buzz 


katharina

well ta en  and like a buzzard 


petruchio

o slow wing turtle  shall a buzzard take thee 


katharina

ay  for a turtle  as he takes a buzzard 


petruchio

come  come  you wasp  i  faith  you are too angry 


katharina

if i be waspish  best beware my sting 


petruchio

my remedy is then  to pluck it out 


katharina

ay  if the fool could find it where it lies 


petruchio

who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting  in his tail 


katharina

in his tongue 


petruchio

whose tongue 


katharina

yours  if you talk of tails  and so farewell 


petruchio

what  with my tongue in your tail  nay  come again 
good kate  i am a gentleman 


katharina

that i try 
she strikes him


petruchio

i swear i cuff you  if you strike again 


katharina

so may you lose your arms 
if you strike me  you are no gentleman 
and if no gentleman  why then no arms 


petruchio

a herald  kate  o  put me in thy books 


katharina

what is your crest  a coxcomb 


petruchio

a combless cock  so kate will be my hen 


katharina

no cock of mine  you crow too like a craven 


petruchio

nay  come  kate  come  you must not look so sour 


katharina

it is my fashion  when i see a crab 


petruchio

why  here no crab  and therefore look not sour 


katharina

there is  there is 


petruchio

petruchio

now  by saint george  i am too young for you 


katharina

yet you are wither d 


petruchio

 with cares 


katharina

i care not 


petruchio

nay  hear you  kate  in sooth you scape not so 


katharina

i chafe you  if i tarry  let me go 


petruchio

no  not a whit  i find you passing gentle 
 told me you were rough and coy and sullen 
and now i find report a very liar 
for thou are pleasant  gamesome  passing courteous 
but slow in speech  yet sweet as spring time flowers 
thou canst not frown  thou canst not look askance 
nor bite the lip  as angry wenches will 
nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk 
but thou with mildness entertain thy wooers 
with gentle conference  soft and affable 
why does the world report that kate doth limp 
o slanderous world  kate like the hazel twig
is straight and slender and as brown in hue
as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels 
o  let me see thee walk  thou dost not halt 


katharina

go  fool  and whom thou keep command 


petruchio

did ever dian so become a grove
as kate this chamber with her princely gait 
o  be thou dian  and let her be kate 
and then let kate be chaste and dian sportful 


katharina

where did you study all this goodly speech 


petruchio

it is extempore  from my mother wit 


katharina

a witty mother  witless else her son 


petruchio

am i not wise 


katharina

yes  keep you warm 


petruchio

marry  so i mean  sweet katharina  in thy bed 
and therefore  setting all this chat aside 
thus in plain terms  your father hath consented
that you shall be my wife  your dowry  on 
and  will you  nill you  i will marry you 
now  kate  i am a husband for your turn 
for  by this light  whereby i see thy beauty 
thy beauty  that doth make me like thee well 
thou must be married to no man but me 
for i am he am born to tame you kate 
and bring you from a wild kate to a kate
conformable as other household kates 
here comes your father  never make denial 
i must and will have katharina to my wife

to wish me wed to one half lunatic 
a mad cup ruffian and a swearing jack 
that thinks with oaths to face the matter out 


petruchio

father   thus  yourself and all the world 
that talk of her  have talk amiss of her 
if she be curst  it is for policy 
for she not froward  but modest as the dove 
she is not hot  but temperate as the morn 
for patience she will prove a second grissel 
and roman lucrece for her chastity 
and to conclude  we have  so well together 
that upon sunday is the wedding day

a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew

graybeard  thy love doth freeze 


gremio

but thine doth fry

within rich pisa walls  as any one
old signior gremio has in padua 
besides two thousand ducats by the year
of fruitful land  all which shall be her jointure 
what  have i pinch you  signior gremio 


gremio

two thousand ducats by the year of land 
my land amounts not to so much in all 
that she shall have  besides an argosy
that now is lying in marseilles  road 
what  have i choked you with an argosy 


tranio

gremio   known my father hath no less
than three great argosies  besides two galliases 
and twelve tight galleys  these i will assure her 
and twice as much  whate thou offer next 


gremio

nay  i have offer all  i have no more 
and she can have no more than all i have 
if you like me  she shall have me and mine 


tranio

why  then the maid is mine from all the world 
by your firm promise  gremio is out vied 


baptista

i must confess your offer is the best 
and  let your father make her the assurance 
she is your own  else  you must pardon me 
if you should die before him  where her dower

to give thee all  and in his waning age
set foot under thy table  tut  a toy 
an old italian fox is not so kind  my boy 
exit


tranio

a vengeance on your crafty wither hide 
yet i have faced it with a card of ten 
 in my head to do my master good 
i see no reason but supposed lucentio
must get a father  call vincentio 
and that a wonder  fathers commonly
do get their children  but in this case of wooing 
a child shall get a sire  if i fail not of my cunning
