scene i  padua  baptista house 


enter lucentio  hortensio  and bianca


lucentio

fiddler  forbear  you grow too forward  sir 
have you so soon forgot the entertainment
her sister katharina welcomed you withal 


hortensio

but  wrangling pedant  this is
the patroness of heavenly harmony 
then give me leave to have prerogative 
and when in music we have spent an hour 
your lecture shall have leisure for as much 


lucentio

preposterous ass  that never read so far
to know the cause why music was ordain d 
was it not to refresh the mind of man
after his studies or his usual pain 
then give me leave to read philosophy 
and while i pause  serve in your harmony 


hortensio

sirrah  i will not bear these braves of thine 


bianca

why  gentlemen  you do me double wrong 
to strive for that which resteth in my choice 
i am no breeching scholar in the schools 
i not be tied to hours nor  times 
but learn my lessons as i please myself 
and  to cut off all strife  here sit we down 
take you your instrument  play you the whiles 
his lecture will be done ere you have tuned 


hortensio

you leave his lecture when i am in tune 


lucentio

that will be never  tune your instrument 


bianca

where left we last 


lucentio

here  madam 
 ibat simois  hic est sigeia tellus 
hic steterat priami regia celsa senis 


bianca

construe them 


lucentio

 ibat  as i told you before   simois  i am
lucentio   est  son unto vincentio of pisa 
 tellus  disguised thus to get your love 
 steterat  and that lucentio that comes
a wooing   priami  is my man tranio   regia 
bearing my port   senis  that we might
beguile the old pantaloon 


hortensio

madam  my instrument in tune 


bianca

let hear  o fie  the treble jars 


lucentio

spit in the hole  man  and tune again 


bianca

now let me see if i can construe it   ibat
simois  i know you not   est sigeia tellus  i
trust you not   steterat priami  take heed
he hear us not   regia  presume not   senis 
despair not 


hortensio

madam   now in tune 


lucentio

all but the base 


hortensio

the base is right   the base knave that jars 
aside
how fiery and forward our pedant is 
now  for my life  the knave doth court my love 
pedascule  i watch you better yet 


bianca

in time i may believe  yet i mistrust 


lucentio

mistrust it not  for  sure  aeacides
was ajax  call so from his grandfather 


bianca

i must believe my master  else  i promise you 
i should be arguing still upon that doubt 
but let it rest  now  licio  to you 
good masters  take it not unkindly  pray 
that i have been thus pleasant with you both 


hortensio

you may go walk  and give me leave a while 
my lessons make no music in three parts 


lucentio

are you so formal  sir  well  i must wait 
aside
and watch withal  for  but i be deceived 
our fine musician groweth amorous 


hortensio

madam  before you touch the instrument 
to learn the order of my fingering 
i must begin with rudiments of art 
to teach you gamut in a briefer sort 
more pleasant  pithy and effectual 
than hath been taught by any of my trade 
and there it is in writing  fairly drawn 


bianca

why  i am past my gamut long ago 


hortensio

yet read the gamut of hortensio 


bianca

 reads    gamut  i am  the ground of all accord 
 re  to plead hortensio passion 
 mi  bianca  take him for thy lord 
 fa ut  that loves with all affection 
 sol re  one clef  two notes have i 
 la mi  show pity  or i die 
call you this gamut  tut  i like it not 
old fashions please me best  i am not so nice 
to change true rules for old inventions 
enter a servant


servant

mistress  your father prays you leave your books
and help to dress your sister chamber up 
you know to morrow is the wedding day 


bianca

farewell  sweet masters both  i must be gone 
exeunt bianca and servant


lucentio

faith  mistress  then i have no cause to stay 
exit


hortensio

but i have cause to pry into this pedant 
methinks he looks as though he were in love 
yet if thy thoughts  bianca  be so humble
to cast thy wandering eyes on every stale 
seize thee that list  if once i find thee ranging 
hortensio will be quit with thee by changing 
exit
