baptista

 to tranio   signior lucentio  this is the
 day 
that katharina and petruchio should be married 
and yet we hear not of our son in law 
what will be said  what mockery will it be 
to want the bridegroom when the priest attends
to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage 
what says lucentio to this shame of ours 


katharina

no shame but mine  i must  forsooth  be forced
to give my hand opposed against my heart
unto a mad brain rudesby full of spleen 
who woo in haste and means to wed at leisure 
i told you  i  he was a frantic fool 
hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior 
and  to be noted for a merry man 
he woo a thousand   the day of marriage 
make feasts  invite friends  and proclaim the banns 
yet never means to wed where he hath woo d 
now must the world point at poor katharina 
and say   lo  there is mad petruchio wife 
if it would please him come and marry her 


tranio

patience  good katharina  and baptista too 
upon my life  petruchio means but well 
whatever fortune stays him from his word 
though he be blunt  i know him passing wise 
though he be merry  yet withal he honest 


katharina

would katharina had never seen him though 
exit weeping  followed by bianca and others


baptista

go  girl  i cannot blame thee now to weep 
for such an injury would vex a very saint 
much more a shrew of thy impatient humour 
enter biondello


biondello

master  master  news  old news  and such news as
you never heard of 


baptista

is it new and old too  how may that be 


biondello

why  is it not news  to hear of petruchio coming 


baptista

is he come 


biondello

why  no  sir 


baptista

what then 


biondello

he is coming 


baptista

when will he be here 


biondello

when he stands where i am and sees you there 


tranio

but say  what to thine old news 


biondello

why  petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
jerkin  a pair of old breeches thrice turned  a pair
of boots that have been candle cases  one buckled 
another laced  an old rusty sword ta out of the
town armory  with a broken hilt  and chapeless 
with two broken points  his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred 
besides  possessed with the glanders and like to mose
in the chine  troubled with the lampass  infected
with the fashions  full of wingdalls  sped with
spavins  rayed with yellows  past cure of the fives 
stark spoiled with the staggers  begnawn with the
bots  swayed in the back and shoulder shotten 
near legged before and with  a half chequed bit
and a head stall of sheeps leather which  being
restrained to keep him from stumbling  hath been
often burst and now repaired with knots  one girth
six time pieced and a woman crupper of velure 
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
in studs  and here and there pieced with packthread 


baptista

who comes with him 


biondello

o  sir  his lackey  for all the world caparisoned
like the horse  with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boot hose on the other  gartered with a red
and blue list  an old hat and  humour of forty
fancies  pricked in for a feather  a monster  a
very monster in apparel  and not like a christian
footboy or a gentleman lackey 


tranio

 some odd humour pricks him to this fashion 
yet oftentimes he goes but mean apparell d 


baptista

i am glad he come  howsoe he comes 


biondello

why  sir  he comes not 


baptista

didst thou not say he comes 


biondello

who  that petruchio came 


baptista

ay  that petruchio came 


biondello

no  sir  i say his horse comes  with him on his back 


baptista

why  that all one 


biondello

   nay  by saint jamy 
i hold you a penny 
a horse and a man
is more than one 
and yet not many 
enter petruchio and grumio


petruchio

come  where be these gallants  who at home 


baptista

you are welcome  sir 


petruchio

and yet i come not well 


baptista

and yet you halt not 


tranio

not so well apparell 
as i wish you were 


petruchio

were it better  i should rush in thus 
but where is kate  where is my lovely bride 
how does my father  gentles  methinks you frown 
and wherefore gaze this goodly company 
as if they saw some wondrous monument 
some comet or unusual prodigy 


baptista

why  sir  you know this is your wedding day 
first were we sad  fearing you would not come 
now sadder  that you come so unprovided 
fie  doff this habit  shame to your estate 
an eye sore to our solemn festival 


tranio

and tells us  what occasion of import
hath all so long detain you from your wife 
and sent you hither so unlike yourself 


petruchio

tedious it were to tell  and harsh to hear 
sufficeth i am come to keep my word 
though in some part enforced to digress 
which  at more leisure  i will so excuse
as you shall well be satisfied withal 
but where is kate  i stay too long from her 
the morning wears   time we were at church 


tranio

see not your bride in these unreverent robes 
go to my chamber  put on clothes of mine 


petruchio

not i  believe me  thus i visit her 


baptista

but thus  i trust  you will not marry her 


petruchio

good sooth  even thus  therefore ha  done with words 
to me she married  not unto my clothes 
could i repair what she will wear in me 
as i can change these poor accoutrements 
 well for kate and better for myself 
but what a fool am i to chat with you 
when i should bid good morrow to my bride 
and seal the title with a lovely kiss 
exeunt petruchio and grumio


tranio

he hath some meaning in his mad attire 
we will persuade him  be it possible 
to put on better ere he go to church 


baptista

i after him  and see the event of this 
exeunt baptista  gremio  and attendants


tranio

but to her love concerneth us to add
her father liking  which to bring to pass 
as i before unparted to your worship 
i am to get a man whate he be 
it skills not much  we fit him to our turn 
and he shall be vincentio of pisa 
and make assurance here in padua
of greater sums than i have promised 
so shall you quietly enjoy your hope 
and marry sweet bianca with consent 


lucentio

were it not that my fellow school master
doth watch bianca steps so narrowly 
 good  methinks  to steal our marriage 
which once perform d  let all the world say no 
i keep mine own  despite of all the world 


tranio

that by degrees we mean to look into 
and watch our vantage in this business 
we over reach the greybeard  gremio 
the narrow prying father  minola 
the quaint musician  amorous licio 
all for my master sake  lucentio 
re enter gremio
signior gremio  came you from the church 


gremio

as willingly as e i came from school 


tranio

and is the bride and bridegroom coming home 


gremio

a bridegroom say you   a groom indeed 
a grumbling groom  and that the girl shall find 


tranio

curster than she  why   impossible 


gremio

why he a devil  a devil  a very fiend 


tranio

why  she a devil  a devil  the devil dam 


gremio

tut  she a lamb  a dove  a fool to him 
i tell you  sir lucentio  when the priest
should ask  if katharina should be his wife 
 ay  by gogs wouns  quoth he  and swore so loud 
that  all amazed  the priest let fall the book 
and  as he stoop again to take it up 
the mad brain bridegroom took him such a cuff
that down fell priest and book and book and priest 
 take them up  quoth he   any list 


tranio

what said the wench when he rose again 


gremio

trembled and shook  for why  he stamp and swore 
as if the vicar meant to cozen him 
but after many ceremonies done 
he calls for wine   health  quoth he  as if
he had been aboard  carousing to his mates
after a storm  quaff off the muscadel
and threw the sops all in the sexton face 
having no other reason
but that his beard grew thin and hungerly
and seem to ask him sops as he was drinking 
this done  he took the bride about the neck
and kiss her lips with such a clamorous smack
that at the parting all the church did echo 
and i seeing this came thence for very shame 
and after me  i know  the rout is coming 
such a mad marriage never was before 
hark  hark  i hear the minstrels play 
music
