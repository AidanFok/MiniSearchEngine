before to make a fire  and they are coming after to
warm them  now  were not i a little pot and soon
hot  my very lips might freeze to my teeth  my
tongue to the roof of my mouth  my heart in my
belly  ere i should come by a fire to thaw me  but
i  with blowing the fire  shall warm myself  for 
considering the weather  a taller man than i will
take cold  holla  ho  curtis

from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
but my head and my neck  a fire good curtis 


curtis

knowest  winter tames man  woman and beast  for it
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
myself  fellow curtis 


curtis

away  you three inch fool  i am no beast 


grumio

am i but three inches  why  thy horn is a foot  and
so long am i at the least  but wilt thou make a
fire  or shall i complain on thee to our mistress 
whose hand  she being now at hand  thou shalt soon
feel  to thy cold comfort  for being slow in thy hot office 


curtis

i prithee  good grumio  tell me  how goes the world 


grumio

a cold world  curtis  in every office but thine  and
therefore fire  do thy duty  and have thy duty  for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death

grumio

why   jack  boy  ho  boy  and as much news as
will thaw 


curtis

come  you are so full of cony catching 


grumio

why  therefore fire  for i have caught extreme cold 
where the cook  is supper ready  the house
trimmed  rushes strewed  cobwebs swept  the
serving men in their new fustian  their white
stockings  and every officer his wedding garment on 
be the jacks fair within  the jills fair without 
the carpets laid  and every thing in order 


curtis

all ready  and therefore  i pray thee  news 


grumio

first  know  my horse is tired  my master and
mistress fallen out 


curtis

how 


grumio

out of their saddles into the dirt  and thereby
hangs a tale 


curtis

let ha t  good grumio 


grumio

lend thine ear 


curtis

here 


grumio

there 
strikes him


curtis

this is to feel a tale  not to hear a tale 


grumio

and therefore  called a sensible tale  and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear  and beseech
listening  now i begin  imprimis  we came down a
foul hill  my master riding behind my mistress 


curtis

both of one horse 


grumio

what that to thee 


curtis

why  a horse 


grumio

tell thou the tale  but hadst thou not crossed me 
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
under her horse  thou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place  how she was bemoiled  how he left her
with the horse upon her  how he beat me because
her horse stumbled  how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me  how he swore  how she prayed 
that never prayed before  how i cried  how the
horses ran away  how her bridle was burst  how i
lost my crupper  with many things of worthy memory 
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave 


curtis

by this reckoning he is more shrew than she 


grumio

ay  and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
find when he comes home  but what talk i of this 
call forth nathaniel  joseph  nicholas  philip 
walter  sugarsop and the rest  let their heads be
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
garters of an indifferent knit  let them curtsy
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
of my master horse tail till they kiss their
hands  are they all ready 


curtis

they are 


grumio

countenance my mistress

 burnt  and so is all the meat 
what dogs are these  where is the rascal cook 
how durst you  villains  bring it from the dresser

nathaniel

peter  didst ever see the like 


peter

he kills her in her own humour 
re enter curtis


grumio

where is he 


curtis

in her chamber  making a sermon of continency to her 
and rails  and swears  and rates  that she  poor soul 
knows not which way to stand  to look  to speak 
and sits as one new risen from a dream 
away  away  for he is coming hither 
exeunt
re enter petruchio


petruchio

thus have i politicly begun my reign 
and  my hope to end successfully 
my falcon now is sharp and passing empty 
and till she stoop she must not be full gorged 
for then she never looks upon her lure 
another way i have to man my haggard 
to make her come and know her keeper call 
that is  to watch her  as we watch these kites
that bate and beat and will not be obedient 
she eat no meat to day  nor none shall eat 
last night she slept not  nor to night she shall not 
as with the meat  some undeserved fault
i find about the making of the bed 
and here i fling the pillow  there the bolster 
this way the coverlet  another way the sheets 
ay  and amid this hurly i intend
that all is done in reverend care of her 
and in conclusion she shall watch all night 
and if she chance to nod i rail and brawl
and with the clamour keep her still awake 
this is a way to kill a wife with kindness 
and thus i curb her mad and headstrong humour 
he that knows better how to tame a shrew 
now let him speak   charity to show 
exit
