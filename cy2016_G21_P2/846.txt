o despiteful love  unconstant womankind 
i tell thee  licio  this is wonderful 


hortensio

mistake no more  i am not licio

but one that scorn to live in this disguise 
for such a one as leaves a gentleman 
and makes a god of such a cullion 
know  sir  that i am call hortensio 


tranio

signior hortensio  i have often heard
of your entire affection to bianca 
and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness 
i will with you  if you be so contented 
forswear bianca and her love for ever 


hortensio

see  how they kiss and court  signior lucentio 
here is my hand  and here i firmly vow
never to woo her no more  but do forswear her 
as one unworthy all the former favours
that i have fondly flatter her withal 


tranio

and here i take the unfeigned oath 
never to marry with her though she would entreat 
fie on her  see  how beastly she doth court him 


hortensio

would all the world but he had quite forsworn 
for me  that i may surely keep mine oath 
i will be married to a wealthy widow 
ere three days pass  which hath as long loved me
as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard 
and so farewell  signior lucentio 
kindness in women  not their beauteous looks 
shall win my love  and so i take my leave 
in resolution as i swore before

as  to a lover blessed case

to tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue

biondello

master  a mercatante  or a pedant 
i know not what  but format in apparel 
in gait and countenance surely like a father 


lucentio

and what of him  tranio 


tranio

if he be credulous and trust my tale 
i make him glad to seem vincentio 
and give assurance to baptista minola 
as if he were the right vincentio
take in your love  and then let me alone 
exeunt lucentio and bianca

hath publish and proclaim it openly 
 tis  marvel  but that you are but newly come

pedant

i know him not  but i have heard of him 
a merchant of incomparable wealth 


tranio

he is my father  sir  and  sooth to say 
in countenance somewhat doth resemble you 


biondello

 aside   as much as an apple doth an oyster 
and all one 


tranio

to save your life in this extremity 
this favour will i do you for his sake 
and think it not the worst of an your fortunes
that you are like to sir vincentio 
his name and credit shall you undertake 
and in my house you shall be friendly lodged 
look that you take upon you as you should 
you understand me  sir  so shall you stay
till you have done your business in the city 
if this be courtesy  sir  accept of it 


pedant

o sir  i do  and will repute you ever
the patron of my life and liberty 


tranio

then go with me to make the matter good 
this  by the way  i let you understand 
my father is here look for every day 
to pass assurance of a dower in marriage
 me and one baptista daughter here 
in all these circumstances i instruct you 
go with me to clothe you as becomes you
