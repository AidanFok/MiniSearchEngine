katharina

the more my wrong  the more his spite appears 
what  did he marry me to famish me 
beggars  that come unto my father door 
upon entreaty have a present aims 
if not  elsewhere they meet with charity 
but i  who never knew how to entreat 
nor never needed that i should entreat 
am starved for meat  giddy for lack of sleep 
with oath kept waking and with brawling fed 
and that which spites me more than all these wants 
he does it under name of perfect love 
as who should say  if i should sleep or eat 
 deadly sickness or else present death 
i prithee go and get me some repast 
i care not what  so it be wholesome food 


grumio

what say you to a neat foot 


katharina

 passing good  i prithee let me have it 


grumio

i fear it is too choleric a meat 
how say you to a fat tripe finely broil d 


katharina

i like it well  good grumio  fetch it me 


grumio

i cannot tell  i fear  choleric 
what say you to a piece of beef and mustard 


katharina

a dish that i do love to feed upon 


grumio

ay  but the mustard is too hot a little 


katharina

why then  the beef  and let the mustard rest 


grumio

nay then  i will not  you shall have the mustard 
or else you get no beef of grumio 


katharina

then both  or one  or any thing thou wilt 


grumio

why then  the mustard without the beef 


katharina

go  get thee gone  thou false deluding slave 
beats him
that feed me with the very name of meat 
sorrow on thee and all the pack of you 
that triumph thus upon my misery 
go  get thee gone  i say 
enter petruchio and hortensio with meat


petruchio

how fares my kate  what  sweeting  all amort 


hortensio

mistress  what cheer 


katharina

faith  as cold as can be 


petruchio

pluck up thy spirits  look cheerfully upon me 
here love  thou see how diligent i am
to dress thy meat myself and bring it thee 
i am sure  sweet kate  this kindness merits thanks 
what  not a word  nay  then thou lovest it not 
and all my pains is sorted to no proof 
here  take away this dish 


katharina

i pray you  let it stand 


petruchio

the poorest service is repaid with thanks 
and so shall mine  before you touch the meat 


katharina

i thank you  sir 


hortensio

signior petruchio  fie  you are to blame 
come  mistress kate  i bear you company 


petruchio

 aside   eat it up all  hortensio  if thou lovest me 
much good do it unto thy gentle heart 
kate  eat apace  and now  my honey love 
will we return unto thy father house
and revel it as bravely as the best 
with silken coats and caps and golden rings 
with ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things 
with scarfs and fans and double change of bravery 
with amber bracelets  beads and all this knavery 
what  hast thou dined  the tailor stays thy leisure 
to deck thy body with his ruffling treasure 
enter tailor
come  tailor  let us see these ornaments 
lay forth the gown 
enter haberdasher
what news with you  sir 


haberdasher

here is the cap your worship did bespeak 


petruchio

why  this was moulded on a porringer 
a velvet dish  fie  fie   lewd and filthy 
why   a cockle or a walnut shell 
a knack  a toy  a trick  a baby cap 
away with it  come  let me have a bigger 


katharina

i have no bigger  this doth fit the time 
and gentlewomen wear such caps as these


petruchio

when you are gentle  you shall have one too 
and not till then 


hortensio

 aside   that will not be in haste 


katharina

why  sir  i trust i may have leave to speak 
and speak i will  i am no child  no babe 
your betters have endured me say my mind 
and if you cannot  best you stop your ears 
my tongue will tell the anger of my heart 
or else my heart concealing it will break 
and rather than it shall  i will be free
even to the uttermost  as i please  in words 


petruchio

why  thou say true  it is a paltry cap 
a custard coffin  a bauble  a silken pie 
i love thee well  in that thou likest it not 


katharina

love me or love me not  i like the cap 
and it i will have  or i will have none 
exit haberdasher


petruchio

thy gown  why  ay  come  tailor  let us see t 
o mercy  god  what masquing stuff is here 
what this  a sleeve   like a demi cannon 
what  up and down  carved like an apple tart 
here snip and nip and cut and slish and slash 
like to a censer in a barber shop 
why  what  i  devil name  tailor  call thou this 


hortensio

 aside   i see she like to have neither cap nor gown 


tailor

you bid me make it orderly and well 
according to the fashion and the time 


petruchio

marry  and did  but if you be remember d 
i did not bid you mar it to the time 
go  hop me over every kennel home 
for you shall hop without my custom  sir 
i none of it  hence  make your best of it 


katharina

i never saw a better fashion gown 
more quaint  more pleasing  nor more commendable 
belike you mean to make a puppet of me 


petruchio

why  true  he means to make a puppet of thee 


tailor

she says your worship means to make
a puppet of her 


petruchio

o monstrous arrogance  thou liest  thou thread 
thou thimble 
thou yard  three quarters  half yard  quarter  nail 
thou flea  thou nit  thou winter cricket thou 
braved in mine own house with a skein of thread 
away  thou rag  thou quantity  thou remnant 
or i shall so be mete thee with thy yard
as thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest 
i tell thee  i  that thou hast marr her gown 


tailor

your worship is deceived  the gown is made
just as my master had direction 
grumio gave order how it should be done 


grumio

i gave him no order  i gave him the stuff 


tailor

but how did you desire it should be made 


grumio

marry  sir  with needle and thread 


tailor

but did you not request to have it cut 


grumio

thou hast faced many things 


tailor

i have 


grumio

face not me  thou hast braved many men  brave not
me  i will neither be faced nor braved  i say unto
thee  i bid thy master cut out the gown  but i did
not bid him cut it to pieces  ergo  thou liest 


tailor

why  here is the note of the fashion to testify


petruchio

read it 


grumio

the note lies in throat  if he say i said so 


tailor

 reads    imprimis  a loose bodied gown 


grumio

master  if ever i said loose bodied gown  sew me in
the skirts of it  and beat me to death with a bottom
of brown thread  i said a gown 


petruchio

proceed 


tailor

 reads    a small compassed cape 


grumio

i confess the cape 


tailor

 reads    a trunk sleeve 


grumio

i confess two sleeves 


tailor

 reads    sleeves curiously cut 


petruchio

ay  there the villany 


grumio

error i  the bill  sir  error i  the bill 
i commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
sewed up again  and that i prove upon thee 
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble 


tailor

this is true that i say  an i had thee
in place where  thou shouldst know it 


grumio

i am for thee straight  take thou the
bill  give me thy mete yard  and spare not me 


hortensio

god a mercy  grumio  then he shall have no odds 


petruchio

well  sir  in brief  the gown is not for me 


grumio

you are i  the right  sir   for my mistress 


petruchio

go  take it up unto thy master use 


grumio

villain  not for thy life  take up my mistress 
gown for thy master use 


petruchio

why  sir  what your conceit in that 


grumio

o  sir  the conceit is deeper than you think for 
take up my mistress  gown to his master use 
o  fie  fie  fie 


petruchio

 aside   hortensio  say thou wilt see the tailor paid 
go take it hence  be gone  and say no more 


hortensio

tailor  i pay thee for thy gown tomorrow 
take no unkindness of his hasty words 
away  i say  commend me to thy master 
exit tailor


petruchio

well  come  my kate  we will unto your father 
even in these honest mean habiliments 
our purses shall be proud  our garments poor 
for  the mind that makes the body rich 
and as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds 
so honour peereth in the meanest habit 
what is the jay more precious than the lark 
because his fathers are more beautiful 
or is the adder better than the eel 
because his painted skin contents the eye 
o  no  good kate  neither art thou the worse
for this poor furniture and mean array 
if thou account it shame  lay it on me 
and therefore frolic  we will hence forthwith 
to feast and sport us at thy father house 
go  call my men  and let us straight to him 
and bring our horses unto long lane end 
there will we mount  and thither walk on foot
let see  i think  now some seven o clock 
and well we may come there by dinner time 


katharina

i dare assure you  sir   almost two 
and  be supper time ere you come there 


petruchio

it shall be seven ere i go to horse 
look  what i speak  or do  or think to do 
you are still crossing it  sirs  let alone 
i will not go to day  and ere i do 
it shall be what o i say it is 


hortensio

 aside   why  so this gallant will command the sun 
exeunt
