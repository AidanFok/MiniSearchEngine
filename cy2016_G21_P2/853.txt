miranda

if by your art  my dearest father  you have
put the wild waters in this roar  allay them 
the sky  it seems  would pour down stinking pitch 
but that the sea  mounting to the welkin cheek 
dashes the fire out  o  i have suffered
with those that i saw suffer  a brave vessel 
who had  no doubt  some noble creature in her 
dash all to pieces  o  the cry did knock
against my very heart  poor souls  they perish d 
had i been any god of power  i would
have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
it should the good ship so have swallow and
the fraughting souls within her 


prospero

be collected 
no more amazement  tell your piteous heart
there no harm done 


miranda

o  woe the day 


prospero

no harm 
i have done nothing but in care of thee 
of thee  my dear one  thee  my daughter  who
art ignorant of what thou art  nought knowing
of whence i am  nor that i am more better
than prospero  master of a full poor cell 
and thy no greater father 


miranda

more to know
did never meddle with my thoughts 


prospero

 time
i should inform thee farther  lend thy hand 
and pluck my magic garment from me  so 
lays down his mantle
lie there  my art  wipe thou thine eyes  have comfort 
the direful spectacle of the wreck  which touch 
the very virtue of compassion in thee 
i have with such provision in mine art
so safely ordered that there is no soul 
no  not so much perdition as an hair
betid to any creature in the vessel
which thou heard cry  which thou saw sink  sit down 
for thou must now know farther 


miranda

you have often
begun to tell me what i am  but stopp 
and left me to a bootless inquisition 
concluding  stay  not yet 


prospero

the hour now come 
the very minute bids thee ope thine ear 
obey and be attentive  canst thou remember
a time before we came unto this cell 
i do not think thou canst  for then thou wast not
out three years old 


miranda

certainly  sir  i can 


prospero

by what  by any other house or person 
of any thing the image tell me that
hath kept with thy remembrance 


miranda

 far off
and rather like a dream than an assurance
that my remembrance warrants  had i not
four or five women once that tended me 


prospero

thou hadst  and more  miranda  but how is it
that this lives in thy mind  what seest thou else
in the dark backward and abysm of time 
if thou remember aught ere thou camest here 
how thou camest here thou mayst 


miranda

but that i do not 


prospero

twelve year since  miranda  twelve year since 
thy father was the duke of milan and
a prince of power 


miranda

                  sir  are not you my father 


prospero

thy mother was a piece of virtue  and
she said thou wast my daughter  and thy father
was duke of milan  and thou his only heir
and princess no worse issued 


miranda

o the heavens 
what foul play had we  that we came from thence 
or blessed was we did 


prospero

both  both  my girl 
by foul play  as thou say st  were we heaved thence 
but blessedly holp hither 


miranda

o  my heart bleeds
to think o  the teen that i have turn you to 
which is from my remembrance  please you  farther 


prospero

my brother and thy uncle  call antonio 
i pray thee  mark me that a brother should
be so perfidious he whom next thyself
of all the world i loved and to him put
the manage of my state  as at that time
through all the signories it was the first
and prospero the prime duke  being so reputed
in dignity  and for the liberal arts
without a parallel  those being all my study 
the government i cast upon my brother
and to my state grew stranger  being transported
and rapt in secret studies  thy false uncle 
dost thou attend me 


miranda

sir  most heedfully 


prospero

being once perfected how to grant suits 
how to deny them  who to advance and who
to trash for over topping  new created
the creatures that were mine  i say  or changed  em 
or else new form em  having both the key
of officer and office  set all hearts i  the state
to what tune pleased his ear  that now he was
the ivy which had hid my princely trunk 
and suck my verdure out on t  thou attend not 


miranda

o  good sir  i do 


prospero

                  i pray thee  mark me 
i  thus neglecting worldly ends  all dedicated
to closeness and the bettering of my mind
with that which  but by being so retired 
o er prized all popular rate  in my false brother
awaked an evil nature  and my trust 
like a good parent  did beget of him
a falsehood in its contrary as great
as my trust was  which had indeed no limit 
a confidence sans bound  he being thus lorded 
not only with what my revenue yielded 
but what my power might else exact  like one
who having into truth  by telling of it 
made such a sinner of his memory 
to credit his own lie  he did believe
he was indeed the duke  out o  the substitution
and executing the outward face of royalty 
with all prerogative  hence his ambition growing 
dost thou hear 


miranda

                  your tale  sir  would cure deafness 


prospero

to have no screen between this part he play 
and him he play it for  he needs will be
absolute milan  me  poor man  my library
was dukedom large enough  of temporal royalties
he thinks me now incapable  confederates 
so dry he was for sway wi  the king of naples
to give him annual tribute  do him homage 
subject his coronet to his crown and bend
the dukedom yet unbow d alas  poor milan 
to most ignoble stooping 


miranda

o the heavens 


prospero

mark his condition and the event  then tell me
if this might be a brother 


miranda

i should sin
to think but nobly of my grandmother 
good wombs have borne bad sons 


prospero

now the condition 
the king of naples  being an enemy
to me inveterate  hearkens my brother suit 
which was  that he  in lieu o  the premises
of homage and i know not how much tribute 
should presently extirpate me and mine
out of the dukedom and confer fair milan
with all the honours on my brother  whereon 
a treacherous army levied  one midnight
fated to the purpose did antonio open
the gates of milan  and  i  the dead of darkness 
the ministers for the purpose hurried thence
me and thy crying self 


miranda

alack  for pity 
i  not remembering how i cried out then 
will cry it o again  it is a hint
that wrings mine eyes to t 


prospero

hear a little further
and then i bring thee to the present business
which now upon s  without the which this story
were most impertinent 


miranda

wherefore did they not
that hour destroy us 


prospero

well demanded  wench 
my tale provokes that question  dear  they durst not 
so dear the love my people bore me  nor set
a mark so bloody on the business  but
with colours fairer painted their foul ends 
in few  they hurried us aboard a bark 
bore us some leagues to sea  where they prepared
a rotten carcass of a boat  not rigg d 
nor tackle  sail  nor mast  the very rats
instinctively had quit it  there they hoist us 
to cry to the sea that roar to us  to sigh
to the winds whose pity  sighing back again 
did us but loving wrong 


miranda

alack  what trouble
was i then to you 


prospero

                  o  a cherubim
thou wast that did preserve me  thou didst smile 
infused with a fortitude from heaven 
when i have deck the sea with drops full salt 
under my burthen groan d  which raised in me
an undergoing stomach  to bear up
against what should ensue 


miranda

how came we ashore 


prospero

by providence divine 
some food we had and some fresh water that
a noble neapolitan  gonzalo 
out of his charity  being then appointed
master of this design  did give us  with
rich garments  linens  stuffs and necessaries 
which since have steaded much  so  of his gentleness 
knowing i loved my books  he furnish me
from mine own library with volumes that
i prize above my dukedom 


miranda

would i might
but ever see that man 


prospero

now i arise 
resumes his mantle
sit still  and hear the last of our sea sorrow 
here in this island we arrived  and here
have i  thy schoolmaster  made thee more profit
than other princesses can that have more time
for vainer hours and tutors not so careful 


miranda

heavens thank you for t  and now  i pray you  sir 
for still  beating in my mind  your reason
for raising this sea storm 


prospero

know thus far forth 
by accident most strange  bountiful fortune 
now my dear lady  hath mine enemies
brought to this shore  and by my prescience
i find my zenith doth depend upon
a most auspicious star  whose influence
if now i court not but omit  my fortunes
will ever after droop  here cease more questions 
thou art inclined to sleep   a good dulness 
and give it way  i know thou canst not choose 
miranda sleeps
come away  servant  come  i am ready now 
approach  my ariel  come 
enter ariel


ariel

all hail  great master  grave sir  hail  i come
to answer thy best pleasure  be to fly 
to swim  to dive into the fire  to ride
on the curl clouds  to thy strong bidding task
ariel and all his quality 


prospero

hast thou  spirit 
perform to point the tempest that i bade thee 


ariel

to every article 
i boarded the king ship  now on the beak 
now in the waist  the deck  in every cabin 
i flamed amazement  sometime i divide 
and burn in many places  on the topmast 
the yards and bowsprit  would i flame distinctly 
then meet and join  jove lightnings  the precursors
o  the dreadful thunder claps  more momentary
and sight outrunning were not  the fire and cracks
of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune
seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble 
yea  his dread trident shake 


prospero

my brave spirit 
who was so firm  so constant  that this coil
would not infect his reason 


ariel

not a soul
but felt a fever of the mad and play 
some tricks of desperation  all but mariners
plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel 
then all afire with me  the king son  ferdinand 
with hair up staring then like reeds  not hair 
was the first man that leap d  cried   is empty
and all the devils are here 


prospero

but was not this nigh shore

prospero

but are they  ariel  safe

on their sustaining garments not a blemish 
but fresher than before  and  as thou badest me 
in troops i have dispersed them  the isle 
the king son have i landed by himself 
whom i left cooling of the air with sighs
in an odd angle of the isle and sitting 
his arms in this sad knot 


prospero

of the king ship
the mariners say how thou hast disposed
and all the rest o  the fleet 


ariel

safely in harbour
is the king ship  in the deep nook  where once
thou call me up at midnight to fetch dew
from the still vex bermoothes  there she hid 
the mariners all under hatches stow d 
who  with a charm join to their suffer labour 
i have left asleep  and for the rest o  the fleet
which i dispersed  they all have met again
and are upon the mediterranean flote 
bound sadly home for naples 
supposing that they saw the king ship wreck 
and his great person perish 


prospero

and here was left by the sailors  thou  my slave 
as thou report thyself  wast then her servant 
and  for thou wast a spirit too delicate
to act her earthy and abhorr commands 
refusing her grand hests  she did confine thee 
by help of her more potent ministers
and in her most unmitigable rage 
into a cloven pine  within which rift
imprison thou didst painfully remain
a dozen years  within which space she died
and left thee there  where thou didst vent thy groans
as fast as mill wheels strike  then was this island 
save for the son that she did litter here 
a freckled whelp hag born not honour with
a human shape

of ever angry bears  it was a torment
to lay upon the damn d  which sycorax
could not again undo  it was mine art 
when i arrived and heard thee  that made gape
the pine and let thee out

a thing most brutish  i endow thy purposes
with words that made them known  but thy vile race 
though thou didst learn  had that in which
good natures
could not abide to be with  therefore wast thou
deservedly confined into this rock 
who hadst deserved more than a prison

some god o  the island  sitting on a bank

with its sweet air  thence i have follow it 
or it hath drawn me rather  but  gone

but doth suffer a sea change
into something rich and strange 
sea nymphs hourly ring his knell
burthen ding dong
hark  now i hear them ding dong  bell

so they are 
my spirits  as in a dream  are all bound up 
my father loss  the weakness which i feel 
the wreck of all my friends  nor this man threats 
to whom i am subdued  are but light to me 
might i but through my prison once a day
behold this maid  all corners else o  the earth
let liberty make use of  space enough
have i in such a prison 


prospero

 aside                 it works 
to ferdinand
come on 
thou hast done well  fine ariel 
to ferdinand
follow me 
to ariel
hark what thou else shalt do me 


miranda

be of comfort 
my father of a better nature  sir 
than he appears by speech  this is unwonted
which now came from him 


prospero

thou shalt be free
as mountain winds  but then exactly do
all points of my command 


ariel

to the syllable 


prospero

come  follow  speak not for him
