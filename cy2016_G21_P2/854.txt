enter alonso  sebastian  antonio  gonzalo  adrian  francisco  and others


gonzalo

beseech you  sir  be merry  you have cause 
so have we all  of joy  for our escape
is much beyond our loss  our hint of woe
is common  every day some sailor wife 
the masters of some merchant and the merchant
have just our theme of woe  but for the miracle 
i mean our preservation  few in millions
can speak like us  then wisely  good sir  weigh
our sorrow with our comfort 


alonso

prithee  peace 


sebastian

he receives comfort like cold porridge 


antonio

the visitor will not give him o so 


sebastian

look he winding up the watch of his wit 
by and by it will strike 


gonzalo

sir 


sebastian

one  tell 


gonzalo

when every grief is entertain that offer d 
comes to the entertainer 


sebastian

a dollar 


gonzalo

dolour comes to him  indeed  you
have spoken truer than you purposed 


sebastian

you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should 


gonzalo

therefore  my lord 


antonio

fie  what a spendthrift is he of his tongue 


alonso

i prithee  spare 


gonzalo

well  i have done  but yet 


sebastian

he will be talking 


antonio

which  of he or adrian  for a good
wager  first begins to crow 


sebastian

the old cock 


antonio

the cockerel 


sebastian

done  the wager 


antonio

a laughter 


sebastian

a match 


adrian

though this island seem to be desert 


sebastian

ha  ha  ha  so  you paid 


adrian

uninhabitable and almost inaccessible 


sebastian

yet 


adrian

yet 


antonio

he could not miss t 


adrian

it must needs be of subtle  tender and delicate
temperance 


antonio

temperance was a delicate wench 


sebastian

ay  and a subtle  as he most learnedly delivered 


adrian

the air breathes upon us here most sweetly 


sebastian

as if it had lungs and rotten ones 


antonio

or as  perfumed by a fen 


gonzalo

here is everything advantageous to life 


antonio

true  save means to live 


sebastian

of that there none  or little 


gonzalo

how lush and lusty the grass looks  how green 


antonio

the ground indeed is tawny 


sebastian

with an eye of green in t 


antonio

he misses not much 


sebastian

no  he doth but mistake the truth totally 


gonzalo

but the rarity of it is which is indeed almost
beyond credit 


sebastian

as many vouched rarities are 


gonzalo

that our garments  being  as they were  drenched in
the sea  hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses  being rather new dyed than stained with
salt water 


antonio

if but one of his pockets could speak  would it not
say he lies 


sebastian

ay  or very falsely pocket up his report


gonzalo

methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on first in afric  at the marriage of
the king fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis 


sebastian

 a sweet marriage  and we prosper well in our return 


adrian

tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen 


gonzalo

not since widow dido time 


antonio

widow  a pox o  that  how came that widow in 
widow dido 


sebastian

what if he had said  aeneas  too  good lord 
how you take it 


adrian

 dido  said you  you make me study of that 
she was of carthage  not of tunis 


gonzalo

this tunis  sir  was carthage 


adrian

carthage 


gonzalo

i assure you  carthage 


sebastian

his word is more than the miraculous harp  he hath
raised the wall and houses too 


antonio

what impossible matter will he make easy next 


sebastian

i think he will carry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an apple 


antonio

and  sowing the kernels of it in the sea  bring
forth more islands 


gonzalo

ay 


antonio

why  in good time 


gonzalo

sir  we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage
of your daughter  who is now queen 


antonio

and the rarest that e came there 


sebastian

bate  i beseech you  widow dido 


antonio

o  widow dido  ay  widow dido 


gonzalo

is not  sir  my doublet as fresh as the first day i
wore it  i mean  in a sort 


antonio

that sort was well fished for 


gonzalo

when i wore it at your daughter marriage 


alonso

you cram these words into mine ears against
the stomach of my sense  would i had never
married my daughter there  for  coming thence 
my son is lost and  in my rate  she too 
who is so far from italy removed
i ne again shall see her  o thou mine heir
of naples and of milan  what strange fish
hath made his meal on thee 


francisco

sir  he may live 
i saw him beat the surges under him 
and ride upon their backs  he trod the water 
whose enmity he flung aside  and breasted
the surge most swoln that met him  his bold head
 the contentious waves he kept  and oar 
himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
to the shore  that o his wave worn basis bow d 
as stooping to relieve him  i not doubt
he came alive to land 


alonso

no  no  he gone 


sebastian

sir  you may thank yourself for this great loss 
that would not bless our europe with your daughter 
but rather lose her to an african 
where she at least is banish from your eye 
who hath cause to wet the grief on t 


alonso

prithee  peace 


sebastian

you were kneel to and importuned otherwise
by all of us  and the fair soul herself
weigh between loathness and obedience  at
which end o  the beam should bow  we have lost your
son 
i fear  for ever  milan and naples have
more widows in them of this business  making
than we bring men to comfort them 
the fault your own 


alonso

so is the dear o  the loss 


gonzalo

my lord sebastian 
the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
and time to speak it in  you rub the sore 
when you should bring the plaster 


sebastian

very well 


antonio

and most chirurgeonly 


gonzalo

it is foul weather in us all  good sir 
when you are cloudy 


sebastian

foul weather 


antonio

very foul 


gonzalo

had i plantation of this isle  my lord 


antonio

he sow with nettle seed 


sebastian

or docks  or mallows 


gonzalo

and were the king on t  what would i do 


sebastian

 being drunk for want of wine 


gonzalo

i  the commonwealth i would by contraries
execute all things  for no kind of traffic
would i admit  no name of magistrate 
letters should not be known  riches  poverty 
and use of service  none  contract  succession 
bourn  bound of land  tilth  vineyard  none 
no use of metal  corn  or wine  or oil 
no occupation  all men idle  all 
and women too  but innocent and pure 
no sovereignty 


sebastian

                  yet he would be king on t 


antonio

the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning 


gonzalo

all things in common nature should produce
without sweat or endeavour  treason  felony 
sword  pike  knife  gun  or need of any engine 
would i not have  but nature should bring forth 
of its own kind  all foison  all abundance 
to feed my innocent people 


sebastian

no marrying  his subjects 


antonio

none  man  all idle  whores and knaves 


gonzalo

i would with such perfection govern  sir 
to excel the golden age 


sebastian

god save his majesty 


antonio

long live gonzalo 


gonzalo

                  and do you mark me  sir 


alonso

prithee  no more  thou dost talk nothing to me 


gonzalo

i do well believe your highness  and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen 
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing 


antonio

 you we laughed at 


gonzalo

who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to you  so you may continue and laugh at
nothing still 


antonio

what a blow was there given 


sebastian

an it had not fallen flat long 


gonzalo

you are gentlemen of brave metal  you would lift
the moon out of her sphere  if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing 
enter ariel  invisible  playing solemn music


sebastian

we would so  and then go a bat fowling 


antonio

nay  good my lord  be not angry 


gonzalo

no  i warrant you  i will not adventure
my discretion so weakly  will you laugh
me asleep  for i am very heavy 


antonio

go sleep  and hear us 
all sleep except alonso  sebastian  and antonio


alonso

what  all so soon asleep  i wish mine eyes
would  with themselves  shut up my thoughts  i find
they are inclined to do so 


sebastian

please you  sir 
do not omit the heavy offer of it 
it seldom visits sorrow  when it doth 
it is a comforter 


antonio

                  we two  my lord 
will guard your person while you take your rest 
and watch your safety 


alonso

thank you  wondrous heavy 
alonso sleeps  exit ariel


sebastian

what a strange drowsiness possesses them 


antonio

it is the quality o  the climate 


sebastian

why
doth it not then our eyelids sink  i find not
myself disposed to sleep 


antonio

nor i  my spirits are nimble 
they fell together all  as by consent 
they dropp d  as by a thunder stroke  what might 
worthy sebastian  o  what might no more 
and yet me thinks i see it in thy face 
what thou shouldst be  the occasion speaks thee  and
my strong imagination sees a crown
dropping upon thy head 


sebastian

what  art thou waking 


antonio

do you not hear me speak 


sebastian

i do  and surely
it is a sleepy language and thou speak 
out of thy sleep  what is it thou didst say 
this is a strange repose  to be asleep
with eyes wide open  standing  speaking  moving 
and yet so fast asleep 


antonio

noble sebastian 
thou let thy fortune sleep die  rather  wink 
whiles thou art waking 


sebastian

thou dost snore distinctly 
there meaning in thy snores 


antonio

i am more serious than my custom  you
must be so too  if heed me  which to do
trebles thee o er 


sebastian

                  well  i am standing water 


antonio

i teach you how to flow 


sebastian

do so  to ebb
hereditary sloth instructs me 


antonio

o 
if you but knew how you the purpose cherish
whiles thus you mock it  how  in stripping it 
you more invest it  ebbing men  indeed 
most often do so near the bottom run
by their own fear or sloth 


sebastian

prithee  say on 
the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
a matter from thee  and a birth indeed
which throes thee much to yield 


antonio

thus  sir 
although this lord of weak remembrance  this 
who shall be of as little memory
when he is earth d  hath here almost persuade 
for he a spirit of persuasion  only
professes to persuade the king his son alive 
 as impossible that he undrown 
and he that sleeps here swims 


sebastian

i have no hope
that he undrown d 


antonio

o  out of that  hope 
what great hope have you  no hope that way is
another way so high a hope that even
ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond 
but doubt discovery there  will you grant with me
that ferdinand is drown d 


sebastian

he gone 


antonio

then  tell me 
who the next heir of naples 


sebastian

claribel 


antonio

she that is queen of tunis  she that dwells
ten leagues beyond man life  she that from naples
can have no note  unless the sun were post 
the man i  the moon too slow till new born chins
be rough and razorable  she that from whom 
we all were sea swallow d  though some cast again 
and by that destiny to perform an act
whereof what past is prologue  what to come
in yours and my discharge 


sebastian

what stuff is this  how say you 
 true  my brother daughter queen of tunis 
so is she heir of naples   which regions
there is some space 


antonio

a space whose every cubit
seems to cry out   shall that claribel
measure us back to naples  keep in tunis 
and let sebastian wake  say  this were death
that now hath seized them  why  they were no worse
than now they are  there be that can rule naples
as well as he that sleeps  lords that can prate
as amply and unnecessarily
as this gonzalo  i myself could make
a chough of as deep chat  o  that you bore
the mind that i do  what a sleep were this
for your advancement  do you understand me 


sebastian

methinks i do 


antonio

                  and how does your content
tender your own good fortune 


sebastian

i remember
you did supplant your brother prospero 


antonio

true 
and look how well my garments sit upon me 
much feater than before  my brother servants
were then my fellows  now they are my men 


sebastian

but  for your conscience 


antonio

ay  sir  where lies that  if  a kibe 
 put me to my slipper  but i feel not
this deity in my bosom  twenty consciences 
that stand  me and milan  candied be they
and melt ere they molest  here lies your brother 
no better than the earth he lies upon 
if he were that which now he like  that dead 
whom i  with this obedient steel  three inches of it 
can lay to bed for ever  whiles you  doing thus 
to the perpetual wink for aye might put
this ancient morsel  this sir prudence  who
should not upbraid our course  for all the rest 
they take suggestion as a cat laps milk 
they tell the clock to any business that
we say befits the hour 


sebastian

thy case  dear friend 
shall be my precedent  as thou got milan 
i come by naples  draw thy sword  one stroke
shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest 
and i the king shall love thee 


antonio

draw together 
and when i rear my hand  do you the like 
to fall it on gonzalo 


sebastian

o  but one word 
they talk apart
re enter ariel  invisible


ariel

my master through his art foresees the danger
that you  his friend  are in  and sends me forth 
for else his project dies to keep them living 
sings in gonzalo ear
while you here do snoring lie 
open eyed conspiracy
his time doth take 
if of life you keep a care 
shake off slumber  and beware 
awake  awake 


antonio

then let us both be sudden 


gonzalo

now  good angels
preserve the king 
they wake


alonso

why  how now  ho  awake  why are you drawn 
wherefore this ghastly looking 


gonzalo

what the matter 


sebastian

whiles we stood here securing your repose 
even now  we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
like bulls  or rather lions  did not wake you 
it struck mine ear most terribly 


alonso

i heard nothing 


antonio

o   a din to fright a monster ear 
to make an earthquake  sure  it was the roar
of a whole herd of lions 


alonso

heard you this  gonzalo 


gonzalo

upon mine honour  sir  i heard a humming 
and that a strange one too  which did awake me 
i shaked you  sir  and cried  as mine eyes open d 
i saw their weapons drawn  there was a noise 
that verily   best we stand upon our guard 
or that we quit this place  let draw our weapons 


alonso

lead off this ground  and let make further search
for my poor son 


gonzalo

heavens keep him from these beasts 
for he is  sure  i  the island 


alonso

lead away 


ariel

prospero my lord shall know what i have done 
so  king  go safely on to seek thy son
