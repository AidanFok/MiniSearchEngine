scene ii  another part of the island 


enter caliban with a burden of wood  a noise of thunder heard


caliban

all the infections that the sun sucks up
from bogs  fens  flats  on prosper fall and make him
by inch meal a disease  his spirits hear me
and yet i needs must curse  but they nor pinch 
fright me with urchin shows  pitch me i  the mire 
nor lead me  like a firebrand  in the dark
out of my way  unless he bid  em  but
for every trifle are they set upon me 
sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
and after bite me  then like hedgehogs which
lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
their pricks at my footfall  sometime am i
all wound with adders who with cloven tongues
do hiss me into madness 
enter trinculo
lo  now  lo 
here comes a spirit of his  and to torment me
for bringing wood in slowly  i fall flat 
perchance he will not mind me 


trinculo

here neither bush nor shrub  to bear off
any weather at all  and another storm brewing 
i hear it sing i  the wind  yond same black
cloud  yond huge one  looks like a foul
bombard that would shed his liquor  if it
should thunder as it did before  i know not
where to hide my head  yond same cloud cannot
choose but fall by pailfuls  what have we
here  a man or a fish  dead or alive  a fish 
he smells like a fish  a very ancient and fish 
like smell  a kind of not of the newest poor 
john  a strange fish  were i in england now 
as once i was  and had but this fish painted 
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
of silver  there would this monster make a
man  any strange beast there makes a man 
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
beggar  they will lazy out ten to see a dead
indian  legged like a man and his fins like
arms  warm o  my troth  i do now let loose
my opinion  hold it no longer  this is no fish 
but an islander  that hath lately suffered by a
thunderbolt 
thunder
alas  the storm is come again  my best way is to
creep under his gaberdine  there is no other
shelter hereabouts  misery acquaints a man with
strange bed fellows  i will here shroud till the
dregs of the storm be past 
enter stephano  singing  a bottle in his hand


stephano

   i shall no more to sea  to sea 
here shall i die ashore 
this is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man 
funeral  well  here my comfort 
drinks
sings
the master  the swabber  the boatswain and i 
the gunner and his mate
loved mall  meg and marian and margery 
but none of us cared for kate 
for she had a tongue with a tang 
would cry to a sailor  go hang 
she loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch 
yet a tailor might scratch her where she did itch 
then to sea  boys  and let her go hang 
this is a scurvy tune too  but here my comfort 
drinks


caliban

do not torment me  oh 


stephano

what the matter  have we devils here  do you put
tricks upon with savages and men of ind  ha  i
have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
four legs  for it hath been said  as proper a man as
ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground 
and it shall be said so again while stephano
breathes at nostrils 


caliban

the spirit torments me  oh 


stephano

this is some monster of the isle with four legs  who
hath got  as i take it  an ague  where the devil
should he learn our language  i will give him some
relief  if it be but for that  if i can recover him
and keep him tame and get to naples with him  he a
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat leather 


caliban

do not torment me  prithee  i bring my wood home faster 


stephano

wisest  he shall taste of my bottle  if he have
never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
fit  if i can recover him and keep him tame  i will
not take too much for him  he shall pay for him that
hath him  and that soundly 


caliban

friend  his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
and to detract  if all the wine in my bottle will
recover him  i will help his ague  come  amen  i
