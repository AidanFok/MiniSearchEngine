scene i  before prospero cell 


enter ferdinand  bearing a log


ferdinand

there be some sports are painful  and their labour
delight in them sets off  some kinds of baseness
are nobly undergone and most poor matters
point to rich ends  this my mean task
would be as heavy to me as odious  but
the mistress which i serve quickens what dead
and makes my labours pleasures  o  she is
ten times more gentle than her father crabbed 
and he composed of harshness  i must remove
some thousands of these logs and pile them up 
upon a sore injunction  my sweet mistress
weeps when she sees me work  and says  such baseness
had never like executor  i forget 
but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours 
most busy lest  when i do it 
enter miranda  and prospero at a distance  unseen


miranda

alas  now  pray you 
work not so hard  i would the lightning had
burnt up those logs that you are enjoin to pile 
pray  set it down and rest you  when this burns 
 weep for having wearied you  my father
is hard at study  pray now  rest yourself 
he safe for these three hours 


ferdinand

o most dear mistress 
the sun will set before i shall discharge
what i must strive to do 


miranda

if you sit down 
i bear your logs the while  pray  give me that 
i carry it to the pile 


ferdinand

no  precious creature 
i had rather crack my sinews  break my back 
than you should such dishonour undergo 
while i sit lazy by 


miranda

it would become me
as well as it does you  and i should do it
with much more ease  for my good will is to it 
and yours it is against 


prospero

poor worm  thou art infected 
this visitation shows it 


miranda

you look wearily 


ferdinand

no  noble mistress fresh morning with me
when you are by at night  i do beseech you 
chiefly that i might set it in my prayers 
what is your name 


miranda

                  miranda o my father 
i have broke your hest to say so 


ferdinand

admired miranda 
indeed the top of admiration  worth
what dearest to the world  full many a lady
i have eyed with best regard and many a time
the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
brought my too diligent ear  for several virtues
have i liked several women  never any
with so fun soul  but some defect in her
did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
and put it to the foil  but you  o you 
so perfect and so peerless  are created
of every creature best 


miranda

i do not know
one of my sex  no woman face remember 
save  from my glass  mine own  nor have i seen
more that i may call men than you  good friend 
and my dear father  how features are abroad 
i am skilless of  but  by my modesty 
the jewel in my dower  i would not wish
any companion in the world but you 
nor can imagination form a shape 
besides yourself  to like of  but i prattle
something too wildly and my father precepts
i therein do forget 


ferdinand

i am in my condition
a prince  miranda  i do think  a king 
i would  not so and would no more endure
this wooden slavery than to suffer
the flesh fly blow my mouth  hear my soul speak 
the very instant that i saw you  did
my heart fly to your service  there resides 
to make me slave to it  and for your sake
am i this patient log man 


miranda

do you love me 


ferdinand

o heaven  o earth  bear witness to this sound
and crown what i profess with kind event
if i speak true  if hollowly  invert
what best is boded me to mischief  i
beyond all limit of what else i  the world
do love  prize  honour you 


miranda

i am a fool
to weep at what i am glad of 


prospero

fair encounter
of two most rare affections  heavens rain grace
on that which breeds between  em 


ferdinand

wherefore weep you 


miranda

at mine unworthiness that dare not offer
what i desire to give  and much less take
what i shall die to want  but this is trifling 
and all the more it seeks to hide itself 
the bigger bulk it shows  hence  bashful cunning 
and prompt me  plain and holy innocence 
i am your wife  if you will marry me 
if not  i die your maid  to be your fellow
you may deny me  but i be your servant 
whether you will or no 


ferdinand

my mistress  dearest 
and i thus humble ever 


miranda

my husband  then 


ferdinand

ay  with a heart as willing
as bondage e of freedom  here my hand 


miranda

and mine  with my heart in t  and now farewell
till half an hour hence 


ferdinand

a thousand thousand 
exeunt ferdinand and miranda severally


prospero

so glad of this as they i cannot be 
who are surprised withal  but my rejoicing
at nothing can be more  i to my book 
for yet ere supper time must i perform
much business appertaining 
exit
