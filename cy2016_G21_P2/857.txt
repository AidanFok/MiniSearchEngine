for my part  the sea cannot drown me  i swam  ere i
could recover the shore  five and thirty leagues off

stephano

we not run  monsieur monster 


trinculo

nor go neither  but you lie like dogs and yet say
nothing neither

moon calf  speak once in thy life  if thou beest a
good moon calf 


caliban

how does thy honour  let me lick thy shoe 
i not serve him  he not valiant 


trinculo

thou liest  most ignorant monster  i am in case to
justle a constable  why  thou deboshed fish thou 
was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
sack as i to day  wilt thou tell a monstrous lie 
being but half a fish and half a monster 


caliban

lo  how he mocks me  wilt thou let him  my lord 


trinculo

 lord  quoth he  that a monster should be such a natural 


caliban

lo  lo  again  bite him to death  i prithee 


stephano

trinculo  keep a good tongue in your head  if you
prove a mutineer the next tree  the poor monster 
my subject and he shall not suffer indignity 


caliban

i thank my noble lord  wilt thou be pleased to
hearken once again to the suit i made to thee 


stephano

marry  will i	kneel and repeat it  i will stand 
and so shall trinculo 
enter ariel  invisible


caliban

as i told thee before  i am subject to a tyrant  a
sorcerer  that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island 


ariel

thou liest 


caliban

thou liest  thou jesting monkey  thou  i would my
valiant master would destroy thee  i do not lie 


stephano

trinculo  if you trouble him any more in tale  by
this hand  i will supplant some of your teeth 


trinculo

why  i said nothing 


stephano

mum  then  and no more  proceed 


caliban

i say  by sorcery he got this isle 
from me he got it  if thy greatness will
revenge it on him for i know thou darest 
but this thing dare not 


stephano

that most certain 


caliban

thou shalt be lord of it and i serve thee 


stephano

how now shall this be compassed 
canst thou bring me to the party 


caliban

yea  yea  my lord  i yield him thee asleep 
where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead 


ariel

thou liest  thou canst not 


caliban

what a pied ninny this  thou scurvy patch 
i do beseech thy greatness  give him blows
and take his bottle from him  when that gone
he shall drink nought but brine  for i not show him
where the quick freshes are 


stephano

trinculo  run into no further danger 
interrupt the monster one word further  and 
by this hand  i turn my mercy out o  doors
and make a stock fish of thee 


trinculo

why  what did i  i did nothing  i go farther
off 


stephano

didst thou not say he lied 


ariel

thou liest 


stephano

do i so  take thou that 
beats trinculo
as you like this  give me the lie another time 


trinculo

i did not give the lie  out o  your
wits and bearing too  a pox o  your bottle 
this can sack and drinking do  a murrain on
your monster  and the devil take your fingers 


caliban

ha  ha  ha 


stephano

now  forward with your tale  prithee  stand farther
off 


caliban

beat him enough  after a little time
i beat him too 


stephano

                  stand farther  come  proceed 


caliban

why  as i told thee   a custom with him 
i  th  afternoon to sleep  there thou mayst brain him 
having first seized his books  or with a log
batter his skull  or paunch him with a stake 
or cut his wezand with thy knife  remember
first to possess his books  for without them
he but a sot  as i am  nor hath not
one spirit to command  they all do hate him
as rootedly as i  burn but his books 
he has brave utensils for so he calls them 
which when he has a house  he deck withal
and that most deeply to consider is
the beauty of his daughter  he himself
calls her a nonpareil  i never saw a woman 
but only sycorax my dam and she 
but she as far surpasseth sycorax
as great does least 


stephano

is it so brave a lass 


caliban

ay  lord  she will become thy bed  i warrant 
and bring thee forth brave brood 


stephano

monster  i will kill this man  his daughter and i
will be king and queen save our graces and
trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys  dost thou
like the plot  trinculo 


trinculo

excellent 


stephano

give me thy hand  i am sorry i beat thee  but 
while thou livest  keep a good tongue in thy head 


caliban

within this half hour will he be asleep 
wilt thou destroy him then 


stephano

ay  on mine honour 


ariel

this will i tell my master 


caliban

thou makest me merry  i am full of pleasure 
let us be jocund  will you troll the catch
you taught me but while ere 


stephano

at thy request  monster  i will do reason  any
reason  come on  trinculo  let us sing 
sings
flout  and scout  
and scout  and flout  
thought is free 


caliban

that not the tune 
ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe


stephano

what is this same 


trinculo

this is the tune of our catch  played by the picture
of nobody 


stephano

if thou beest a man  show thyself in thy likeness 
if thou beest a devil  take as thou list 


trinculo

o  forgive me my sins 


stephano

he that dies pays all debts  i defy thee  mercy upon us 


caliban

art thou afeard 


stephano

no  monster  not i 


caliban

be not afeard  the isle is full of noises 
sounds and sweet airs  that give delight and hurt not 
sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
will hum about mine ears  and sometime voices
that  if i then had waked after long sleep 
will make me sleep again  and then  in dreaming 
the clouds methought would open and show riches
ready to drop upon me that  when i waked 
i cried to dream again 


stephano

this will prove a brave kingdom to me  where i shall
have my music for nothing 


caliban

when prospero is destroyed 


stephano

that shall be by and by  i remember the story 


trinculo

the sound is going away  let follow it  and
after do our work 


stephano

lead  monster  we follow  i would i could see
this tabourer  he lays it on 


trinculo

wilt come  i follow  stephano 
exeunt
