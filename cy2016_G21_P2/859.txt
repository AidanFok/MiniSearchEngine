prospero

if i have too austerely punish you 
your compensation makes amends  for i
have given you here a third of mine own life 
or that for which i live  who once again
i tender to thy hand  all thy vexations
were but my trials of thy love and thou
hast strangely stood the test here  afore heaven 
i ratify this my rich gift  o ferdinand 
do not smile at me that i boast her off 
for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
and make it halt behind her 


ferdinand

i do believe it
against an oracle 


prospero

then  as my gift and thine own acquisition
worthily purchased take my daughter  but
if thou dost break her virgin knot before
all sanctimonious ceremonies may
with full and holy rite be minister d 
no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
to make this contract grow  but barren hate 
sour eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
the union of your bed with weeds so loathly
that you shall hate it both  therefore take heed 
as hymen lamps shall light you 


ferdinand

as i hope
for quiet days  fair issue and long life 
with such love as  now  the murkiest den 
the most opportune place  the strong suggestion 
our worser genius can  shall never melt
mine honour into lust  to take away
the edge of that day celebration
when i shall think  or phoebus  steeds are founder d 
or night kept chain below 


prospero

fairly spoke 
sit then and talk with her  she is thine own 
what  ariel  my industrious servant  ariel 
enter ariel


ariel

what would my potent master  here i am 


prospero

thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
did worthily perform  and i must use you
in such another trick  go bring the rabble 
o whom i give thee power  here to this place 
incite them to quick motion  for i must
bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
some vanity of mine art  it is my promise 
and they expect it from me 


ariel

presently 


prospero

ay  with a twink 


ariel

   before you can say  come  and  go 
and breathe twice and cry  so  so 
each one  tripping on his toe 
will be here with mop and mow 
do you love me  master  no 


prospero

dearly my delicate ariel  do not approach
till thou dost hear me call 


ariel

well  i conceive 
exit


prospero

look thou be true  do not give dalliance
too much the rein  the strongest oaths are straw
to the fire i  the blood  be more abstemious 
or else  good night your vow 


ferdinand

i warrant you sir 
the white cold virgin snow upon my heart
abates the ardour of my liver 


prospero

well 
now come  my ariel  bring a corollary 
rather than want a spirit  appear and pertly 
no tongue  all eyes  be silent 
soft music
enter iris

ceres  most bounteous lady  thy rich leas
of wheat  rye  barley  vetches  oats and pease 
thy turfy mountains  where live nibbling sheep 
and flat meads thatch with stover  them to keep 
thy banks with pioned and twilled brims 
which spongy april at thy hest betrims 
to make cold nymphs chaste crowns  and thy broom  groves 
whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves 
being lass lorn  thy pole clipt vineyard 
and thy sea marge  sterile and rocky hard 
where thou thyself dost air the queen o  the sky 
whose watery arch and messenger am i 
bids thee leave these  and with her sovereign grace 
here on this grass plot  in this very place 
to come and sport  her peacocks fly amain 
approach  rich ceres  her to entertain

ceres

hail  many colour messenger  that ne 
dost disobey the wife of jupiter 
who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
diffusest honey drops  refreshing showers 
and with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
my bosky acres and my unshrubb down 
rich scarf to my proud earth  why hath thy queen
summon me hither  to this short grass green 


iris

a contract of true love to celebrate 
and some donation freely to estate
on the blest lovers 


ceres

tell me  heavenly bow 
if venus or her son  as thou dost know 
do now attend the queen  since they did plot
the means that dusky dis my daughter got 
her and her blind boy scandal company
i have forsworn 


iris

                  of her society
be not afraid  i met her deity
cutting the clouds towards paphos and her son
dove drawn with her  here thought they to have done
some wanton charm upon this man and maid 
whose vows are  that no bed right shall be paid
till hymen torch be lighted  but vain 
mars hot minion is returned again 
her waspish headed son has broke his arrows 
swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
and be a boy right out 


ceres

hourly joys be still upon you

vines and clustering bunches growing 
plants with goodly burthen bowing 
spring come to you at the farthest
in the very end of harvest 
scarcity and want shall shun you 
ceres  blessing so is on you 


ferdinand

this is a most majestic vision  and
harmoniously charmingly  may i be bold
to think these spirits 


prospero

spirits  which by mine art
i have from their confines call to enact
my present fancies 


ferdinand

let me live here ever 
so rare a wonder father and a wife
makes this place paradise 
juno and ceres whisper  and send iris on employment


prospero

sweet  now  silence 
juno and ceres whisper seriously 
there something else to do  hush  and be mute 
or else our spell is marr d 


iris

you nymphs  call naiads  of the windring brooks 
with your sedged crowns and ever harmless looks 
leave your crisp channels and on this green land
answer your summons  juno does command 
come  temperate nymphs  and help to celebrate
a contract of true love  be not too late 
enter certain nymphs
you sunburnt sicklemen  of august weary 
come hither from the furrow and be merry 
make holiday  your rye straw hats put on
and these fresh nymphs encounter every one
in country footing 
enter certain reapers  properly habited  they  join with the nymphs in a graceful dance   towards the end whereof prospero starts  suddenly  and speaks  after which  to a  strange  hollow  and confused noise  they heavily vanish


prospero

 aside   i had forgot that foul conspiracy
of the beast caliban and his confederates
against my life  the minute of their plot
is almost come 
to the spirits
well done  avoid  no more 


ferdinand

this is strange  your father in some passion
that works him strongly 


miranda

never till this day
saw i him touch with anger so distemper d 


prospero

you do look  my son  in a moved sort 
as if you were dismay d  be cheerful  sir 
our revels now are ended  these our actors 
as i foretold you  were all spirits and
are melted into air  into thin air 
and  like the baseless fabric of this vision 
the cloud capp towers  the gorgeous palaces 
the solemn temples  the great globe itself 
ye all which it inherit  shall dissolve
and  like this insubstantial pageant faded 
leave not a rack behind  we are such stuff
as dreams are made on  and our little life
is rounded with a sleep  sir  i am vex d 
bear with my weakness  my  brain is troubled 
be not disturb with my infirmity 
if you be pleased  retire into my cell
and there repose  a turn or two i walk 
to still my beating mind 


ferdinand

miranda

we wish your peace 
exeunt


prospero

come with a thought i thank thee  ariel  come

spirit 
we must prepare to meet with caliban 


ariel

ay  my commander  when i presented ceres 
i thought to have told thee of it  but i fear 
lest i might anger thee 


prospero

say again  where didst thou leave these varlets 


ariel

i told you  sir  they were red hot with drinking 
so fun of valour that they smote the air
for breathing in their faces  beat the ground
for kissing of their feet  yet always bending
towards their project  then i beat my tabour 
at which  like unback colts  they prick 
their ears 
advanced their eyelids  lifted up their noses
as they smelt music  so i charm their ears
that calf like they my lowing follow through
tooth briers  sharp furzes  pricking goss and thorns 
which entered their frail shins  at last i left them
i  the filthy mantled pool beyond your cell 
there dancing up to the chins  that the foul lake
o their feet 


prospero

this was well done  my bird 
thy shape invisible retain thou still 
the trumpery in my house  go bring it hither 
for stale to catch these thieves 


ariel

i go  i go 
exit


prospero

a devil  a born devil  on whose nature
nurture can never stick  on whom my pains 
humanely taken  all  all lost  quite lost 
and as with age his body uglier grows 
so his mind cankers  i will plague them all 
even to roaring 
re enter ariel  loaden with glistering apparel     c
come  hang them on this line 
prospero and ariel remain invisible  enter caliban  stephano  and trinculo  all wet

hear a foot fall  we now are near his cell

which my nose is in great indignation 


stephano

all hush as midnight yet 


trinculo

monster  but an infinite loss

harmless fairy  monster

go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
with dry convulsions  shorten up their sinews
with aged cramps  and more pinch spotted make them
than pard or cat o  mountain 


ariel

prospero

let them be hunted soundly  at this hour
lie at my mercy all mine enemies 
shortly shall all my labours end  and thou
shalt have the air at freedom  for a little
follow  and do me service
