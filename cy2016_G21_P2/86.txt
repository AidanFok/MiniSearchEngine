scene i  fields between dartford and blackheath 


enter york  and his army of irish  with drum and colours


york

from ireland thus comes york to claim his right 
and pluck the crown from feeble henry head 
ring  bells  aloud  burn  bonfires  clear and bright 
to entertain great england lawful king 
ah  sancta majestas  who would not buy thee dear 
let them obey that know not how to rule 
this hand was made to handle naught but gold 
i cannot give due action to my words 
except a sword or sceptre balance it 
a sceptre shall it have  have i a soul 
on which i toss the flower de luce of france 
enter buckingham
whom have we here  buckingham  to disturb me 
the king hath sent him  sure  i must dissemble 


buckingham

york  if thou meanest well  i greet thee well 


york

humphrey of buckingham  i accept thy greeting 
art thou a messenger  or come of pleasure 


buckingham

a messenger from henry  our dread liege 
to know the reason of these arms in peace 
or why thou  being a subject as i am 
against thy oath and true allegiance sworn 
should raise so great a power without his leave 
or dare to bring thy force so near the court 


york

 aside   scarce can i speak  my choler is so great 
o  i could hew up rocks and fight with flint 
i am so angry at these abject terms 
and now  like ajax telamonius 
on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury 
i am far better born than is the king 
more like a king  more kingly in my thoughts 
but i must make fair weather yet a while 
till henry be more weak and i more strong 
buckingham  i prithee  pardon me 
that i have given no answer all this while 
my mind was troubled with deep melancholy 
the cause why i have brought this army hither
is to remove proud somerset from the king 
seditious to his grace and to the state 


buckingham

that is too much presumption on thy part 
but if thy arms be to no other end 
the king hath yielded unto thy demand 
the duke of somerset is in the tower 


york

upon thine honour  is he prisoner 


buckingham

upon mine honour  he is prisoner 


york

then  buckingham  i do dismiss my powers 
soldiers  i thank you all  disperse yourselves 
meet me to morrow in st  george field 
you shall have pay and every thing you wish 
and let my sovereign  virtuous henry 
command my eldest son  nay  all my sons 
as pledges of my fealty and love 
i send them all as willing as i live 
lands  goods  horse  armour  any thing i have 
is his to use  so somerset may die 


buckingham

york  i commend this kind submission 
we twain will go into his highness  tent 
enter king henry vi and attendants


king henry vi

buckingham  doth york intend no harm to us 
that thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm 


york

in all submission and humility
york doth present himself unto your highness 


king henry vi

then what intends these forces thou dost bring 


york

to heave the traitor somerset from hence 
and fight against that monstrous rebel cade 
who since i heard to be discomfited 
enter iden  with cade head


iden

if one so rude and of so mean condition
may pass into the presence of a king 
lo  i present your grace a traitor head 
the head of cade  whom i in combat slew 


king henry vi

the head of cade  great god  how just art thou 
o  let me view his visage  being dead

and will that thou henceforth attend on us 


iden

may iden live to merit such a bounty 
and never live but true unto his liege 
rises
enter queen margaret and somerset


king henry vi

see  buckingham  somerset comes with the queen 
go  bid her hide him quickly from the duke 


queen margaret

for thousand yorks he shall not hide his head 
but boldly stand and front him to his face 


york

how now  is somerset at liberty 
then  york  unloose thy long imprison thoughts 
and let thy tongue be equal with thy heart 
shall i endure the sight of somerset 
false king  why hast thou broken faith with me 
knowing how hardly i can brook abuse 
king did i call thee  no  thou art not king 
not fit to govern and rule multitudes 
which darest not  no  nor canst not rule a traitor 
that head of thine doth not become a crown 
thy hand is made to grasp a palmer staff 
and not to grace an awful princely sceptre 
that gold must round engirt these brows of mine 
whose smile and frown  like to achilles  spear 
is able with the change to kill and cure 
here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
and with the same to act controlling laws 
give place  by heaven  thou shalt rule no more
o him whom heaven created for thy ruler 


somerset

o monstrous traitor  i arrest thee  york 
of capital treason  the king and crown

that for my surety will refuse the boys

and here comes clifford to deny their bail

for thy mistaking so  we pardon thee 


clifford

this is my king  york  i do not mistake 
but thou mistakest me much to think i do 
to bedlam with him  is the man grown mad 


king henry vi

ay  clifford  a bedlam and ambitious humour
makes him oppose himself against his king 


clifford

he is a traitor  let him to the tower 
and chop away that factious pate of his 


queen margaret

he is arrested  but will not obey 
his sons  he says  shall give their words for him 


york

will you not  sons 


edward

ay  noble father  if our words will serve 


richard

and if words will not  then our weapons shall 


clifford

why  what a brood of traitors have we here 


york

look in a glass  and call thy image so 
i am thy king  and thou a false heart traitor 
call hither to the stake my two brave bears 
that with the very shaking of their chains
they may astonish these fell lurking curs 
bid salisbury and warwick come to me 
enter the warwick and salisbury


clifford

are these thy bears  we bait thy bears to death 
and manacle the bear ward in their chains 
if thou darest bring them to the baiting place 


richard

oft have i seen a hot o cur
run back and bite  because he was withheld 
who  being suffer with the bear fell paw 
hath clapp his tail between his legs and cried 
and such a piece of service will you do 
if you oppose yourselves to match lord warwick 


clifford

hence  heap of wrath  foul indigested lump 
as crooked in thy manners as thy shape 


york

nay  we shall heat you thoroughly anon 


clifford

take heed  lest by your heat you burn yourselves 


king henry vi

why  warwick  hath thy knee forgot to bow 
old salisbury  shame to thy silver hair 
thou mad misleader of thy brain sick son 
what  wilt thou on thy death bed play the ruffian 
and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles 
o  where is faith  o  where is loyalty 
if it be banish from the frosty head 
where shall it find a harbour in the earth 
wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war 
and shame thine honourable age with blood 
why art thou old  and want experience 
or wherefore dost abuse it  if thou hast it 
for shame  in duty bend thy knee to me
that bows unto the grave with mickle age 


salisbury

my lord  i have consider with myself
the title of this most renowned duke 
and in my conscience do repute his grace
the rightful heir to england royal seat 


king henry vi

hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me 


salisbury

i have 


king henry vi

canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath 


salisbury

it is great sin to swear unto a sin 
but greater sin to keep a sinful oath 
who can be bound by any solemn vow
to do a murderous deed  to rob a man 
to force a spotless virgin chastity 
to reave the orphan of his patrimony 
to wring the widow from her custom right 
and have no other reason for this wrong
but that he was bound by a solemn oath 


queen margaret

a subtle traitor needs no sophister 


king henry vi

call buckingham  and bid him arm himself 


york

call buckingham  and all the friends thou hast 
i am resolved for death or dignity 


clifford

the first i warrant thee  if dreams prove true 


warwick

you were best to go to bed and dream again 
to keep thee from the tempest of the field 


clifford

i am resolved to bear a greater storm
than any thou canst conjure up to day 
and that i write upon thy burgonet 
might i but know thee by thy household badge 


warwick

now  by my father badge  old nevil crest 
the rampant bear chain to the ragged staff 
this day i wear aloft my burgonet 
as on a mountain top the cedar shows
that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm 
even to affright thee with the view thereof 


clifford

and from thy burgonet i rend thy bear
and tread it under foot with all contempt 
despite the bear ward that protects the bear 


young clifford

and so to arms  victorious father 
to quell the rebels and their complices 


richard

fie  charity  for shame  speak not in spite 
for you shall sup with jesu christ to night 


young clifford

foul stigmatic  that more than thou canst tell 


richard

if not in heaven  you surely sup in hell 
exeunt severally
