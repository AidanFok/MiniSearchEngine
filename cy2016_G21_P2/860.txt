scene i  before prospero cell 


enter prospero in his magic robes  and ariel


prospero

now does my project gather to a head 
my charms crack not  my spirits obey  and time
goes upright with his carriage  how the day 


ariel

on the sixth hour  at which time  my lord 
you said our work should cease 


prospero

i did say so 
when first i raised the tempest  say  my spirit 
how fares the king and followers 


ariel

confined together
in the same fashion as you gave in charge 
just as you left them  all prisoners  sir 
in the line grove which weather fends your cell 
they cannot budge till your release  the king 
his brother and yours  abide all three distracted
and the remainder mourning over them 
brimful of sorrow and dismay  but chiefly
him that you term d  sir   good old lord gonzalo 
his tears run down his beard  like winter drops
from eaves of reeds  your charm so strongly works  
that if you now beheld them  your affections
would become tender 


prospero

dost thou think so  spirit 


ariel

mine would  sir  were i human 


prospero

and mine shall 
hast thou  which art but air  a touch  a feeling
of their afflictions  and shall not myself 
one of their kind  that relish all as sharply 
passion as they  be kindlier moved than thou art 
though with their high wrongs i am struck to the quick 
yet with my nobler reason  my fury
do i take part  the rarer action is
in virtue than in vengeance  they being penitent 
the sole drift of my purpose doth extend
not a frown further  go release them  ariel 
my charms i break  their senses i restore 
and they shall be themselves 


ariel

i fetch them  sir 
exit


prospero

ye elves of hills  brooks  standing lakes and groves 
and ye that on the sands with printless foot
do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him
when he comes back  you demi puppets that
by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make 
whereof the ewe not bites  and you whose pastime
is to make midnight mushrooms  that rejoice
to hear the solemn curfew  by whose aid 
weak masters though ye be  i have bedimm 
the noontide sun  call forth the mutinous winds 
and  the green sea and the azured vault
set roaring war  to the dread rattling thunder
have i given fire and rifted jove stout oak
with his own bolt  the strong based promontory
have i made shake and by the spurs pluck up
the pine and cedar  graves at my command
have waked their sleepers  oped  and let  forth
by my so potent art  but this rough magic
i here abjure  and  when i have required
some heavenly music  which even now i do 
to work mine end upon their senses that
this airy charm is for  i break my staff 
bury it certain fathoms in the earth 
and deeper than did ever plummet sound
i drown my book 
solemn music
re enter ariel before  then alonso  with a  frantic gesture  attended by gonzalo   sebastian and antonio in like manner   attended by adrian and francisco   they all  enter the circle which prospero had made   and there stand charmed  which prospero observing  speaks 
a solemn air and the best comforter
to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains 
now useless  boil within thy skull  there stand 
for you are spell stopp d 
holy gonzalo  honourable man 
mine eyes  even sociable to the show of thine 
fall fellowly drops  the charm dissolves apace 
and as the morning steals upon the night 
melting the darkness  so their rising senses
begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
their clearer reason  o good gonzalo 
my true preserver  and a loyal sir
to him you follow st  i will pay thy graces
home both in word and deed  most cruelly
didst thou  alonso  use me and my daughter 
thy brother was a furtherer in the act 
thou art pinch fort now  sebastian  flesh and blood 
you  brother mine  that entertain ambition 
expell remorse and nature  who  with sebastian 
whose inward pinches therefore are most strong 
would here have kill your king  i do forgive thee 
unnatural though thou art  their understanding
begins to swell  and the approaching tide
will shortly fill the reasonable shore
that now lies foul and muddy  not one of them
that yet looks on me  or would know me ariel 
fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell 
i will discase me  and myself present
as i was sometime milan  quickly  spirit 
thou shalt ere long be free 
ariel sings and helps to attire him
where the bee sucks  there suck i 
in a cowslip bell i lie 
there i couch when owls do cry 
on the bat back i do fly
after summer merrily 
merrily  merrily shall i live now
under the blossom that hangs on the bough 


prospero

why  that my dainty ariel  i shall miss thee 
but yet thou shalt have freedom  so  so  so 
to the king ship  invisible as thou art 
there shalt thou find the mariners asleep
under the hatches  the master and the boatswain
being awake  enforce them to this place 
and presently  i prithee 


ariel

i drink the air before me  and return
or ere your pulse twice beat 
exit


gonzalo

all torment  trouble  wonder and amazement
inhabits here  some heavenly power guide us
out of this fearful country 


prospero

behold  sir king 
the wronged duke of milan  prospero 
for more assurance that a living prince
does now speak to thee  i embrace thy body 
and to thee and thy company i bid
a hearty welcome 


alonso

                  whether thou best he or no 
or some enchanted trifle to abuse me 
as late i have been  i not know  thy pulse
beats as of flesh and blood  and  since i saw thee 
the affliction of my mind amends  with which 
i fear  a madness held me  this must crave 
an if this be at all  a most strange story 
thy dukedom i resign and do entreat
thou pardon me my wrongs  but how should prospero
be living and be here 


prospero

first  noble friend 
let me embrace thine age  whose honour cannot
be measured or confined 


gonzalo

whether this be
or be not  i not swear 


prospero

you do yet taste
some subtilties o  the isle  that will not let you
believe things certain  welcome  my friends all 
aside to sebastian and antonio
but you  my brace of lords  were i so minded 
i here could pluck his highness  frown upon you
and justify you traitors  at this time
i will tell no tales 


sebastian

 aside   the devil speaks in him 


prospero

no 
for you  most wicked sir  whom to call brother
would even infect my mouth  i do forgive
thy rankest fault  all of them  and require
my dukedom of thee  which perforce  i know 
thou must restore 


alonso

                  if thou be prospero 
give us particulars of thy preservation 
how thou hast met us here  who three hours since
were wreck upon this shore  where i have lost 
how sharp the point of this remembrance is 
my dear son ferdinand 


prospero

i am woe for t  sir 


alonso

irreparable is the loss  and patience
says it is past her cure 


prospero

i rather think
you have not sought her help  of whose soft grace
for the like loss i have her sovereign aid
and rest myself content 


alonso

you the like loss 


prospero

as great to me as late  and  supportable
to make the dear loss  have i means much weaker
than you may call to comfort you  for i
have lost my daughter 


alonso

a daughter 
o heavens  that they were living both in naples 
the king and queen there  that they were  i wish
myself were mudded in that oozy bed
where my son lies  when did you lose your daughter 


prospero

in this last tempest  i perceive these lords
at this encounter do so much admire
that they devour their reason and scarce think
their eyes do offices of truth  their words
are natural breath  but  howsoe you have
been justled from your senses  know for certain
that i am prospero and that very duke
which was thrust forth of milan  who most strangely
upon this shore  where you were wreck d  was landed 
to be the lord on t  no more yet of this 
for  a chronicle of day by day 
not a relation for a breakfast nor
befitting this first meeting  welcome  sir 
this cell my court  here have i few attendants
and subjects none abroad  pray you  look in 
my dukedom since you have given me again 
i will requite you with as good a thing 
at least bring forth a wonder  to content ye
as much as me my dukedom 
here prospero discovers ferdinand and miranda playing at chess


miranda

sweet lord  you play me false 


ferdinand

no  my dear love 
i would not for the world 


miranda

yes  for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle 
and i would call it  fair play 


alonso

if this prove
a vision of the island  one dear son
shall i twice lose 


sebastian

a most high miracle 


ferdinand

though the seas threaten  they are merciful 
i have cursed them without cause 
kneels


alonso

now all the blessings
of a glad father compass thee about 
arise  and say how thou camest here 


miranda

o  wonder 
how many goodly creatures are there here 
how beauteous mankind is  o brave new world 
that has such people in t 


prospero

 new to thee 


alonso

what is this maid with whom thou wast at play 
your eld acquaintance cannot be three hours 
is she the goddess that hath sever us 
and brought us thus together 


ferdinand

sir  she is mortal 
but by immortal providence she mine 
i chose her when i could not ask my father
for his advice  nor thought i had one  she
is daughter to this famous duke of milan 
of whom so often i have heard renown 
but never saw before  of whom i have
received a second life  and second father
this lady makes him to me 


alonso

i am hers 
but  o  how oddly will it sound that i
must ask my child forgiveness 


prospero

there  sir  stop 
let us not burthen our remembrance with
a heaviness that gone 


gonzalo

i have inly wept 
or should have spoke ere this  look down  you god 
and on this couple drop a blessed crown 
for it is you that have chalk forth the way
which brought us hither 


alonso

i say  amen  gonzalo 


gonzalo

was milan thrust from milan  that his issue
should become kings of naples  o  rejoice
beyond a common joy  and set it down
with gold on lasting pillars  in one voyage
did claribel her husband find at tunis 
and ferdinand  her brother  found a wife
where he himself was lost  prospero his dukedom
in a poor isle and all of us ourselves
when no man was his own 


alonso

 to ferdinand and miranda   give me your hands 
let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
that doth not wish you joy 


gonzalo

be it so  amen 
re enter ariel  with the master and boatswain amazedly following
o  look  sir  look  sir  here is more of us 
i prophesied  if a gallows were on land 
this fellow could not drown  now  blasphemy 
that swear grace o erboard  not an oath on shore 
hast thou no mouth by land  what is the news 


boatswain

the best news is  that we have safely found
our king and company  the next  our ship 
which  but three glasses since  we gave out split 
is tight and yare and bravely rigg as when
we first put out to sea 


ariel

have i done since i went

alonso

these are not natural events  they strengthen
from strange to stranger  say  how came you hither 


boatswain

if i did think  sir  i were well awake 
i strive to tell you  we were dead of sleep 
and how we know not all clapp under hatches 
where but even now with strange and several noises
of roaring  shrieking  howling  jingling chains 
and more diversity of sounds  all horrible 
we were awaked  straightway  at liberty 
where we  in all her trim  freshly beheld
our royal  good and gallant ship  our master
capering to eye her  on a trice  so please you 
even in a dream  were we divided from them
and were brought moping hither 


ariel

 aside to prospero           was well done 


prospero

 aside to ariel   bravely  my diligence  thou shalt be free 


alonso

this is as strange a maze as e men trod
and there is in this business more than nature
was ever conduct of  some oracle
must rectify our knowledge 


prospero

sir  my liege 
do not infest your mind with beating on
the strangeness of this business  at pick leisure
which shall be shortly  single i resolve you 
which to you shall seem probable  of every
these happen accidents  till when  be cheerful
and think of each thing well 
aside to ariel
come hither  spirit 
set caliban and his companions free 
untie the spell 
exit ariel
how fares my gracious sir 
there are yet missing of your company
some few odd lads that you remember not 
re enter ariel  driving in caliban  stephano and trinculo  in their stolen apparel


stephano

every man shift for all the rest  and
let no man take care for himself  for all is
but fortune  coragio  bully monster  coragio 


trinculo

if these be true spies which i wear in my head 
here a goodly sight 


caliban

o setebos  these be brave spirits indeed 
how fine my master is  i am afraid
he will chastise me 


sebastian

ha  ha 
what things are these  my lord antonio 
will money buy  em 


antonio

very like  one of them
is a plain fish  and  no doubt  marketable 


prospero

mark but the badges of these men  my lords 
then say if they be true  this mis shapen knave 
his mother was a witch  and one so strong
that could control the moon  make flows and ebbs 
and deal in her command without her power 
these three have robb me  and this demi devil 
for he a bastard one had plotted with them
to take my life  two of these fellows you
must know and own  this thing of darkness 
acknowledge mine 


caliban

                  i shall be pinch to death 


alonso

is not this stephano  my drunken butler 


sebastian

he is drunk now  where had he wine 


alonso

and trinculo is reeling ripe  where should they
find this grand liquor that hath gilded  em 
how camest thou in this pickle 


trinculo

i have been in such a pickle since i
saw you last that  i fear me  will never out of
my bones  i shall not fear fly blowing 


sebastian

why  how now  stephano 


stephano

o  touch me not  i am not stephano  but a cramp 


prospero

you be king o  the isle  sirrah 


stephano

i should have been a sore one then 


alonso

this is a strange thing as e i look on 
pointing to caliban


prospero

he is as disproportion in his manners
as in his shape  go  sirrah  to my cell 
take with you your companions  as you look
to have my pardon  trim it handsomely 


caliban

ay  that i will  and i be wise hereafter
and seek for grace  what a thrice double ass
was i  to take this drunkard for a god
and worship this dull fool 


prospero

go to  away 


alonso

hence  and bestow your luggage where you found it 


sebastian

or stole it  rather 
exeunt caliban  stephano  and trinculo


prospero

sir  i invite your highness and your train
to my poor cell  where you shall take your rest
for this one night  which  part of it  i waste
with such discourse as  i not doubt  shall make it
go quick away  the story of my life
and the particular accidents gone by
since i came to this isle  and in the morn
i bring you to your ship and so to naples 
where i have hope to see the nuptial
of these our dear beloved solemnized 
and thence retire me to my milan  where
every third thought shall be my grave 


alonso

i long
to hear the story of your life  which must
take the ear strangely 


prospero

i deliver all 
and promise you calm seas  auspicious gales
and sail so expeditious that shall catch
your royal fleet far off 
aside to ariel
my ariel  chick 
that is thy charge  then to the elements
be free  and fare thou well  please you  draw near 
exeunt
epilogue
spoken by prospero
now my charms are all o erthrown 
and what strength i have mine own 
which is most faint  now   true 
i must be here confined by you 
or sent to naples  let me not 
since i have my dukedom got
and pardon the deceiver  dwell
in this bare island by your spell 
but release me from my bands
with the help of your good hands 
gentle breath of yours my sails
must fill  or else my project fails 
which was to please  now i want
spirits to enforce  art to enchant 
and my ending is despair 
unless i be relieved by prayer 
which pierces so that it assaults
mercy itself and frees all faults 
as you from crimes would pardon be 
let your indulgence set me free
