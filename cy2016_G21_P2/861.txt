poet

ay  that well known 
but what particular rarity  what strange 
which manifold record not matches  see 
magic of bounty  all these spirits thy power
hath conjured to attend  i know the merchant 


painter

i know them both  th  other a jeweller 


merchant

o   a worthy lord

he passes 
jeweller 	i have a jewel here 


merchant

o  pray  let see t  for the lord timon  sir 
jeweller 	if he will touch the estimate  but  for that 


poet

 reciting to himself    we for recompense have
praised the vile 
it stains the glory in that happy verse
which aptly sings the good 


merchant

 a good form 
looking at the jewel


jeweller

and rich  here is a water  look ye 


painter

you are rapt  sir  in some work  some dedication
to the great lord 


poet

                  a thing slipp idly from me 
our poesy is as a gum  which oozes
from whence  nourish d  the fire i  the flint
shows not till it be struck  our gentle flame
provokes itself and like the current flies
each bound it chafes  what have you there 


painter

a picture  sir  when comes your book forth 


poet

upon the heels of my presentment  sir 
let see your piece 


painter

poet

so  tis  this comes off well and excellent 


painter

indifferent 


poet

                  admirable  how this grace
speaks his own standing  what a mental power
this eye shoots forth  how big imagination
moves in this lip  to the dumbness of the gesture
one might interpret 


painter

it is a pretty mocking of the life 
here is a touch  is good 


poet

i will say of it 
it tutors nature  artificial strife
lives in these touches  livelier than life 
enter certain senators  and pass over


painter

how this lord is follow d 


poet

the senators of athens  happy man 


painter

look  more 


poet

you see this confluence  this great flood
of visitors 
i have  in this rough work  shaped out a man 
whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
with amplest entertainment  my free drift
halts not particularly  but moves itself
in a wide sea of wax  no levell malice
infects one comma in the course i hold 
but flies an eagle flight  bold and forth on 
leaving no tract behind 


painter

how shall i understand you 


poet

i will unbolt to you 
you see how all conditions  how all minds 
as well of glib and slippery creatures as
of grave and austere quality  tender down
their services to lord timon  his large fortune
upon his good and gracious nature hanging
subdues and properties to his love and tendance
all sorts of hearts  yea  from the glass faced flatterer
to apemantus  that few things loves better
than to abhor himself  even he drops down
the knee before him  and returns in peace
most rich in timon nod 


painter

i saw them speak together 


poet

sir  i have upon a high and pleasant hill
feign fortune to be throned  the base o  the mount
is rank with all deserts  all kind of natures 
that labour on the bosom of this sphere
to propagate their states  amongst them all 
whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix d 
one do i personate of lord timon frame 
whom fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her 
whose present grace to present slaves and servants
translates his rivals 


painter

 conceived to scope 
this throne  this fortune  and this hill  methinks 
with one man beckon from the rest below 
bowing his head against the sleepy mount
to climb his happiness  would be well express 
in our condition 


poet

                  nay  sir  but hear me on 
all those which were his fellows but of late 
some better than his value  on the moment
follow his strides  his lobbies fill with tendance 
rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear 
make sacred even his stirrup  and through him
drink the free air 


painter

ay  marry  what of these 


poet

when fortune in her shift and change of mood
spurns down her late beloved  all his dependants
which labour after him to the mountain top
even on their knees and hands  let him slip down 
not one accompanying his declining foot 


painter

 common 
a thousand moral paintings i can show
that shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortune 
more pregnantly than words  yet you do well
to show lord timon that mean eyes have seen
the foot above the head 
trumpets sound  enter timon  addressing himself  courteously to every suitor  a messenger from  ventidius talking with him  lucilius and other servants following
