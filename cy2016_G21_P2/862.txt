scene ii  a banqueting room in timon house 


hautboys playing loud music  a great banquet  served in  flavius and others attending  then enter  timon  alcibiades  lords  senators  and ventidius   then comes  dropping  after all  apemantus  discontentedly  like himself


ventidius

most honour timon 
it hath pleased the gods to remember my father age 
and call him to long peace 
he is gone happy  and has left me rich 
then  as in grateful virtue i am bound
to your free heart  i do return those talents 
doubled with thanks and service  from whose help
i derived liberty 


timon

                  o  by no means 
honest ventidius  you mistake my love 
i gave it freely ever  and there none
can truly say he gives  if he receives 
if our betters play at that game  we must not dare
to imitate them  faults that are rich are fair 


ventidius

a noble spirit 


timon

                  nay  my lords 
they all stand ceremoniously looking on timon
ceremony was but devised at first
to set a gloss on faint deeds  hollow welcomes 
recanting goodness  sorry ere  shown 
but where there is true friendship  there needs none 
pray  sit  more welcome are ye to my fortunes
than my fortunes to me 
they sit


first lord

my lord  we always have confess it 


apemantus

ho  ho  confess it  hang it  have you not 


timon

o  apemantus  you are welcome 


apemantus

no 
you shall not make me welcome 
i come to have thee thrust me out of doors 


timon

fie  thou a churl  ye got a humour there
does not become a man   much to blame 
they say  my lords   furor brevis est  but yond
man is ever angry  go  let him have a table by
himself  for he does neither affect company  nor is
he fit for t  indeed 


apemantus

let me stay at thine apperil  timon  i come to
observe  i give thee warning on t 


timon

i take no heed of thee  thou an athenian 
therefore welcome  i myself would have no power 
prithee  let my meat make thee silent 


apemantus

i scorn thy meat   choke me  for i should
ne flatter thee  o you gods  what a number of
men eat timon  and he sees  not  it grieves me
to see so many dip their meat in one man blood 
and all the madness is  he cheers them up too 
i wonder men dare trust themselves with men 
methinks they should invite them without knives 
good for their meat  and safer for their lives 
there much example for t  the fellow that sits
next him now  parts bread with him  pledges the
breath of him in a divided draught  is the readiest
man to kill him   has been proved  if i were a
huge man  i should fear to drink at meals 
lest they should spy my windpipe dangerous notes 
great men should drink with harness on their throats 


timon

my lord  in heart  and let the health go round 


second lord

let it flow this way  my good lord 


apemantus

flow this way  a brave fellow  he keeps his tides
well  those healths will make thee and thy state
look ill  timon  here that which is too weak to
be a sinner  honest water  which ne left man i  the mire 
this and my food are equals  there no odds 
feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods 
apemantus  grace 
immortal gods  i crave no pelf 
i pray for no man but myself 
grant i may never prove so fond 
to trust man on his oath or bond 
or a harlot  for her weeping 
or a dog  that seems a sleeping 
or a keeper with my freedom 
or my friends  if i should need  em 
amen  so fall to t 
rich men sin  and i eat root 
eats and drinks
much good dich thy good heart  apemantus 


timon

captain alcibiades  your heart in the field now 


alcibiades

my heart is ever at your service  my lord 


timon

you had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
dinner of friends 


alcibiades

so the were bleeding new  my lord  there no meat
like  em  i could wish my best friend at such a feast 


apemantus

would all those fatterers were thine enemies then 
that then thou mightst kill  and bid me to  em 


first lord

might we but have that happiness  my lord  that you
would once use our hearts  whereby we might express
some part of our zeals  we should think ourselves
for ever perfect 


timon

o  no doubt  my good friends  but the gods
themselves have provided that i shall have much help
from you  how had you been my friends else  why
have you that charitable title from thousands  did
not you chiefly belong to my heart  i have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty
speak in your own behalf  and thus far i confirm
you  o you gods  think i  what need we have any
friends  if we should ne have need of  em  they
were the most needless creatures living  should we
ne have use for  em  and would most resemble
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
sounds to themselves  why  i have often wished
myself poorer  that i might come nearer to you  we
are born to do benefits  and what better or
properer can we can our own than the riches of our
friends  o  what a precious comfort  tis  to have
so many  like brothers  commanding one another 
fortunes  o joy  e made away ere  can be born 
mine eyes cannot hold out water  methinks  to
forget their faults  i drink to you 


apemantus

thou weepest to make them drink  timon 


second lord

joy had the like conception in our eyes
and at that instant like a babe sprung up 


apemantus

ho  ho  i laugh to think that babe a bastard 


third lord

i promise you  my lord  you moved me much 


apemantus

much 
tucket  within


timon

what means that trump 
enter a servant
how now 


servant

please you  my lord  there are certain
ladies most desirous of admittance 


timon

ladies  what are their wills 


servant

there comes with them a forerunner  my lord  which
bears that office  to signify their pleasures 


timon

i pray  let them be admitted 
enter cupid


cupid

hail to thee  worthy timon  and to all
that of his bounties taste  the five best senses
acknowledge thee their patron  and come freely
to gratulate thy plenteous bosom  th  ear 
taste  touch and smell  pleased from thy tale rise 
they only now come but to feast thine eyes 


timon

they welcome all  let  have kind admittance 
music  make their welcome 
exit cupid


first lord

you see  my lord  how ample you beloved 
music  re enter cupid with a mask of ladies  as amazons  with lutes in their hands  dancing and playing


apemantus

hoy day  what a sweep of vanity comes this way 
they dance  they are mad women 
like madness is the glory of this life 
as this pomp shows to a little oil and root 
we make ourselves fools  to disport ourselves 
and spend our flatteries  to drink those men
upon whose age we void it up again 
with poisonous spite and envy 
who lives that not depraved or depraves 
who dies  that bears not one spurn to their graves
of their friends  gift 
i should fear those that dance before me now
would one day stamp upon me   has been done 
men shut their doors against a setting sun 
the lords rise from table  with much adoring of  timon  and to show their loves  each singles out an  amazon  and all dance  men with women  a lofty strain or two to the hautboys  and cease


timon

you have done our pleasures much grace  fair ladies 
set a fair fashion on our entertainment 
which was not half so beautiful and kind 
you have added worth unto  and lustre 
and entertain me with mine own device 
i am to thank you for  t 


first lady

my lord  you take us even at the best 


apemantus

 faith  for the worst is filthy  and would not hold
taking  i doubt me 


timon

ladies  there is an idle banquet attends you 
please you to dispose yourselves 


all ladies

most thankfully  my lord 
exeunt cupid and ladies


timon

flavius 


flavius

timon

       the little casket bring me hither 


flavius

yes  my lord  more jewels yet 
there is no crossing him in  humour 
aside
else i should tell him well  i  faith i should 
when all spent  he  be cross then  an he could 
 pity bounty had not eyes behind 
that man might ne be wretched for his mind 
exit


first lord

where be our men 


servant

here  my lord  in readiness 


second lord

our horses 
re enter flavius  with the casket


timon

          o my friends 
i have one word to say to you  look you  my good lord 
i must entreat you  honour me so much
as to advance this jewel  accept it and wear it 
kind my lord 


first lord

i am so far already in your gifts 


all

so are we all 
enter a servant


servant

my lord  there are certain nobles of the senate
newly alighted  and come to visit you 


timon

they are fairly welcome 


flavius

i beseech your honour 
vouchsafe me a word  it does concern you near 


timon

near  why then  another time i hear thee 
i prithee  let be provided to show them
entertainment 


flavius

 aside   i scarce know how 
enter a second servant


second servant

may it please your honour  lord lucius 
out of his free love  hath presented to you
four milk white horses  trapp in silver 


timon

i shall accept them fairly  let the presents
be worthily entertain d 
enter a third servant
how now  what news 


third servant

please you  my lord  that honourable
gentleman  lord lucullus  entreats your company
to morrow to hunt with him  and has sent your honour
two brace of greyhounds 


timon

i hunt with him  and let them be received 
not without fair reward 


flavius

 aside                 what will this come to 
he commands us to provide  and give great gifts 
and all out of an empty coffer 
nor will he know his purse  or yield me this 
to show him what a beggar his heart is 
being of no power to make his wishes good 
his promises fly so beyond his state
that what he speaks is all in debt  he owes
for every word  he is so kind that he now
pays interest for  t  his land put to their books 
well  would i were gently put out of office
before i were forced out 
happier is he that has no friend to feed
than such that do e enemies exceed 
i bleed inwardly for my lord 
exit


timon

you do yourselves
much wrong  you bate too much of your own merits 
here  my lord  a trifle of our love 


second lord

with more than common thanks i will receive it 


third lord

o  he the very soul of bounty 


timon

and now i remember  my lord  you gave
good words the other day of a bay courser
i rode on  it is yours  because you liked it 


second lord

o  i beseech you  pardon me  my lord  in that 


timon

you may take my word  my lord  i know  no man
can justly praise but what he does affect 
i weigh my friend affection with mine own 
i tell you true  i call to you 


all lords

o  none so welcome 


timon

i take all and your several visitations
so kind to heart   not enough to give 
methinks  i could deal kingdoms to my friends 
and ne be weary  alcibiades 
thou art a soldier  therefore seldom rich 
it comes in charity to thee  for all thy living
is  the dead  and all the lands thou hast
lie in a pitch field 


alcibiades

ay  defiled land  my lord 


first lord

we are so virtuously bound 


timon

and so
am i to you 


second lord

so infinitely endear d 


timon

all to you  lights  more lights 


first lord

the best of happiness 
honour and fortunes  keep with you  lord timon 


timon

ready for his friends 
exeunt all but apemantus and timon


apemantus

what a coil here 
serving of becks and jutting out of bums 
i doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
that are given for  em  friendship full of dregs 
methinks  false hearts should never have sound legs 
thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court sies 


timon

now  apemantus  if thou wert not sullen  i would be
good to thee 


apemantus

no  i nothing  for if i should be bribed too 
there would be none left to rail upon thee  and then
thou wouldst sin the faster  thou givest so long 
timon  i fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
paper shortly  what need these feasts  pomps and
vain glories 


timon

nay  an you begin to rail on society once  i am
sworn not to give regard to you  farewell  and come
with better music 
exit


apemantus

so 
thou wilt not hear me now  thou shalt not then 
i lock thy heaven from thee 
o  that men ears should be
to counsel deaf  but not to flattery 
exit
