flavius

pray you  walk near  i speak with you anon 
exeunt servants


timon

you make me marvel  wherefore ere this time
had you not fully laid my state before me 
that i might so have rated my expense 
as i had leave of means 


flavius

you would not hear me 
at many leisures i proposed 


timon

go to 
perchance some single vantages you took 
when my indispos ition put you back 
and that unaptness made your minister 
thus to excuse yourself 


flavius

o my good lord 
at many times i brought in my accounts 
laid them before you  you would throw them off 
and say  you found them in mine honesty 
when  for some trifling present  you have bid me
return so much  i have shook my head and wept 
yea   the authority of manners  pray you
to hold your hand more close  i did endure
not seldom  nor no slight cheques  when i have
prompted you in the ebb of your estate
and your great flow of debts  my loved lord 
though you hear now  too late yet now a time 
the greatest of your having lacks a half
to pay your present debts 


timon

let all my land be sold 


flavius

 all engaged  some forfeited and gone 
and what remains will hardly stop the mouth
of present dues  the future comes apace 
what shall defend the interim  and at length
how goes our reckoning 


timon

to lacedaemon did my land extend 


flavius

o my good lord  the world is but a word 
were it all yours to give it in a breath 
how quickly were it gone 


timon

you tell me true 


flavius

if you suspect my husbandry or falsehood 
call me before the exactest auditors
and set me on the proof  so the gods bless me 
when all our offices have been oppress 
with riotous feeders  when our vaults have wept
with drunken spilth of wine  when every room
hath blazed with lights and bray with minstrelsy 
i have retired me to a wasteful cock 
and set mine eyes at flow 


timon

prithee  no more 


flavius

heavens  have i said  the bounty of this lord 
how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
this night englutted  who is not timon s 
what heart  head  sword  force  means  but is
lord timon s 
great timon  noble  worthy  royal timon 
ah  when the means are gone that buy this praise 
the breath is gone whereof this praise is made 
feast won  fast lost  one cloud of winter showers 
these flies are couch d 


timon

come  sermon me no further 
no villanous bounty yet hath pass my heart 
unwisely  not ignobly  have i given 
why dost thou weep  canst thou the conscience lack 
to think i shall lack friends  secure thy heart 
if i would broach the vessels of my love 
and try the argument of hearts by borrowing 
men and men fortunes could i frankly use
as i can bid thee speak 


flavius

assurance bless your thoughts 


timon

and  in some sort  these wants of mine are crown d 
that i account them blessings  for by these
shall i try friends  you shall perceive how you
mistake my fortunes  i am wealthy in my friends 
within there  flaminius  servilius 
enter flaminius  servilius  and other servants


servants

my lord  my lord 


timon

i will dispatch you severally  you to lord lucius 
to lord lucullus you  i hunted with his honour
to day  you  to sempronius  commend me to their
loves  and  i am proud  say  that my occasions have
found time to use  toward a supply of money  let
the request be fifty talents 


flaminius

as you have said  my lord 


flavius

 aside   lord lucius and lucullus  hum 


timon

go you  sir  to the senators 
of whom  even to the state best health  i have
deserved this hearing bid  send o  the instant
a thousand talents to me 


flavius

i have been bold 
for that i knew it the most general way 
to them to use your signet and your name 
but they do shake their heads  and i am here
no richer in return 


timon

is true  can be 


flavius

they answer  in a joint and corporate voice 
that now they are at fall  want treasure  cannot
do what they would  are sorry you are honourable 
but yet they could have wish d they know not 
something hath been amiss a noble nature
may catch a wrench would all were well pity 
and so  intending other serious matters 
after distasteful looks and these hard fractions 
with certain half caps and cold moving nods
they froze me into silence 


timon

you gods  reward them 
prithee  man  look cheerly  these old fellows
have their ingratitude in them hereditary 
their blood is caked   cold  it seldom flows 
 lack of kindly warmth they are not kind 
and nature  as it grows again toward earth 
is fashion for the journey  dull and heavy 
to a servant
go to ventidius 
to flavius
prithee  be not sad 
thou art true and honest  ingeniously i speak 
no blame belongs to thee 
to servant
ventidius lately
buried his father  by whose death he stepp 
into a great estate  when he was poor 
imprison and in scarcity of friends 
i clear him with five talents  greet him from me 
bid him suppose some good necessity
touches his friend  which craves to be remember 
with those five talents 
exit servant
to flavius
that had  give these fellows
to whom  instant due  ne speak  or think 
that timon fortunes  his friends can sink 


flavius

i would i could not think it  that thought is
bounty foe 
being free itself  it thinks all others so 
exeunt
