servant

here my lord 


lucullus

 aside   one of lord timon men  a gift  i
warrant  why  this hits right  i dreamt of a silver
basin and ewer to night  flaminius  honest
flaminius  you are very respectively welcome  sir 
fill me some wine 
exit servants
and how does that honourable  complete  free hearted
gentleman of athens  thy very bountiful good lord
and master 


flaminius

his health is well sir 


lucullus

i am right glad that his health is well  sir  and
what hast thou there under thy cloak  pretty flaminius 


flaminius

 faith  nothing but an empty box  sir  which  in my
lord behalf  i come to entreat your honour to
supply  who  having great and instant occasion to
use fifty talents  hath sent to your lordship to
furnish him  nothing doubting your present
assistance therein 


lucullus

la  la  la  la   doubting  says he  alas 
good lord  a noble gentleman  tis  if he would not
keep so good a house  many a time and often i ha 
dined with him  and told him on t  and come again to
supper to him  of purpose to have him spend less 
and yet he would embrace no counsel  take no warning
by my coming  every man has his fault  and honesty
is his  i ha  told him on t  but i could ne get
him from t 
re enter servant  with wine


servant

please your lordship  here is the wine 


lucullus

flaminius  i have noted thee always wise  here to thee 


flaminius

your lordship speaks your pleasure 


lucullus

i have observed thee always for a towardly prompt
spirit give thee thy due and one that knows what
belongs to reason  and canst use the time well  if
the time use thee well  good parts in thee 
to servant
get you gone  sirrah 
exit servant
draw nearer  honest flaminius  thy lord a
bountiful gentleman  but thou art wise  and thou
knowest well enough  although thou comest to me 
that this is no time to lend money  especially upon
bare friendship  without security  here three
solidares for thee  good boy  wink at me  and say
thou sawest me not  fare thee well 


flaminius

is possible the world should so much differ 
and we alive that lived  fly  damned baseness 
to him that worships thee 
throwing the money back


lucullus

ha  now i see thou art a fool  and fit for thy master 
exit


flaminius

may these add to the number that may scald thee 
let moulten coin be thy damnation 
thou disease of a friend  and not himself 
has friendship such a faint and milky heart 
it turns in less than two nights  o you gods 
i feel master passion  this slave 
unto his honour  has my lord meat in him 
why should it thrive and turn to nutriment 
when he is turn to poison 
o  may diseases only work upon t 
and  when he sick to death  let not that part of nature
which my lord paid for  be of any power
to expel sickness  but prolong his hour 
exit
