scene ii  a public place 


enter lucilius  with three strangers


lucilius

who  the lord timon  he is my very good friend  and
an honourable gentleman 


first stranger

we know him for no less  though we are but strangers
to him  but i can tell you one thing  my lord  and
which i hear from common rumours  now lord timon 
happy hours are done and past  and his estate
shrinks from him 


lucilius

fie  no  do not believe it  he cannot want for money 


second stranger

but believe you this  my lord  that  not long ago 
one of his men was with the lord lucullus to borrow
so many talents  nay  urged extremely for and
showed what necessity belonged to t  and yet was denied 


lucilius

how 


second stranger

i tell you  denied  my lord 


lucilius

what a strange case was that  now  before the gods 
i am ashamed on t  denied that honourable man 
there was very little honour showed in t  for my own
part  i must needs confess  i have received some
small kindnesses from him  as money  plate  jewels
and such like trifles  nothing comparing to his 
yet  had he mistook him and sent to me  i should
ne have denied his occasion so many talents 
enter servilius


servilius

see  by good hap  yonder my lord 
i have sweat to see his honour  my honoured lord 
to lucius


lucilius

servilius  you are kindly met  sir  fare thee well 
commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord  my very
exquisite friend 


servilius

may it please your honour  my lord hath sent 


lucilius

ha  what has he sent  i am so much endeared to
that lord  he ever sending  how shall i thank
him  thinkest thou  and what has he sent now 


servilius

has only sent his present occasion now  my lord 
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
with so many talents 


lucilius

i know his lordship is but merry with me 
he cannot want fifty five hundred talents 


servilius

but in the mean time he wants less  my lord 
if his occasion were not virtuous 
i should not urge it half so faithfully 


lucilius

dost thou speak seriously  servilius 


servilius

upon my soul true  sir 


lucilius

what a wicked beast was i to disfurnish myself
against such a good time  when i might ha  shown
myself honourable  how unluckily it happened  that i
should purchase the day before for a little part 
and undo a great deal of honoured  servilius  now 
before the gods  i am not able to do the more
beast  i say i was sending to use lord timon
myself  these gentlemen can witness  but i would
not  for the wealth of athens  i had done now 
commend me bountifully to his good lordship  and i
hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me 
because i have no power to be kind  and tell him
this from me  i count it one of my greatest
afflictions  say  that i cannot pleasure such an
honourable gentleman  good servilius  will you
befriend me so far  as to use mine own words to him 


servilius

yes  sir  i shall 


lucilius

i look you out a good turn  servilius 
exit servilius
true as you said  timon is shrunk indeed 
and he that once denied will hardly speed 
exit


first stranger

do you observe this  hostilius 


second stranger

ay  too well 


first stranger

why  this is the world soul  and just of the
same piece
is every flatterer spirit  who can call him
his friend that dips in the same dish  for  in
my knowing  timon has been this lord father 
and kept his credit with his purse 
supported his estate  nay  timon money
has paid his men their wages  he ne drinks 
but timon silver treads upon his lip 
and yet o  see the monstrousness of man
when he looks out in an ungrateful shape 
he does deny him  in respect of his 
what charitable men afford to beggars 


third stranger

religion groans at it 


first stranger

for mine own part 
i never tasted timon in my life 
nor came any of his bounties over me 
to mark me for his friend  yet  i protest 
for his right noble mind  illustrious virtue
and honourable carriage 
had his necessity made use of me 
i would have put my wealth into donation 
and the best half should have return to him 
so much i love his heart  but  i perceive 
men must learn now with pity to dispense 
for policy sits above conscience
