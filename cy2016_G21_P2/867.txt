scene iii  a room in sempronius  house 


enter sempronius  and a servant of timon 


sempronius

must he needs trouble me in  t hum 
all others 
he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus 
and now ventidius is wealthy too 
whom he redeem from prison  all these
owe their estates unto him 


servant

my lord 
they have all been touch and found base metal  for
they have au denied him 


sempronius

how  have they denied him 
has ventidius and lucullus denied him 
and does he send to me  three  hum 
it shows but little love or judgment in him 
must i be his last refuge  his friends  like
physicians 
thrive  give him over  must i take the cure upon me 
has much disgraced me in t  i angry at him 
that might have known my place  i see no sense for t 
but his occasion might have woo me first 
for  in my conscience  i was the first man
that e received gift from him 
and does he think so backwardly of me now 
that i requite its last  no 
so it may prove an argument of laughter
to the rest  and  lords i be thought a fool 
i rather than the worth of thrice the sum 
had sent to me first  but for my mind sake 
i such a courage to do him good  but now return 
and with their faint reply this answer join 
who bates mine honour shall not know my coin 
exit


servant

excellent  your lordship a goodly villain  the
devil knew not what he did when he made man
politic  he crossed himself by  t  and i cannot
think but  in the end  the villainies of man will
set him clear  how fairly this lord strives to
appear foul  takes virtuous copies to be wicked 
like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
whole realms on fire  of such a nature is his
politic love 
this was my lord best hope  now all are fled 
save only the gods  now his friends are dead 
doors  that were ne acquainted with their wards
many a bounteous year must be employ 
now to guard sure their master 
and this is all a liberal course allows 
who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house 
exit
