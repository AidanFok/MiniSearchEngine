scene iv  the same  a hall in timon house 


enter two servants of varro  and the servant of  lucius  meeting titus  hortensius  and other servants of timon creditors  waiting his coming out


varro 


first servant

well met  good morrow  titus and hortensius 


titus

the like to you kind varro 


hortensius

lucius 
what  do we meet together 
lucilius  servant	ay  and i think
one business does command us all  for mine is money 


titus

so is theirs and ours 
enter philotus
lucilius  servant	and sir philotus too 


philotus

good day at once 
lucilius  servant	                  welcome  good brother 
what do you think the hour 


philotus

labouring for nine 
lucilius  servant	so much 


philotus

is not my lord seen yet 
lucilius  servant	not yet 


philotus

i wonder on t  he was wont to shine at seven 
lucilius  servant	ay  but the days are wax shorter with him 
you must consider that a prodigal course
is like the sun s  but not  like his  recoverable 
i fear  deepest winter in lord timon purse 
that is one may reach deep enough  and yet
find little 


philotus

i am of your fear for that 


titus

i show you how to observe a strange event 
your lord sends now for money 


hortensius

most true  he does 


titus

and he wears jewels now of timon gift 
for which i wait for money 


hortensius

it is against my heart 
lucilius  servant	mark  how strange it shows 
timon in this should pay more than he owes 
and e as if your lord should wear rich jewels 
and send for money for  em 


hortensius

i weary of this charge  the gods can witness 
i know my lord hath spent of timon wealth 
and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth 
varro 


first servant

yes  mine three thousand crowns  what yours 
lucilius  servant	five thousand mine 
varro 


first servant

 much deep  and it should seem by the sun 
your master confidence was above mine 
else  surely  his had equall d 
enter flaminius 


titus

one of lord timon men 
lucilius  servant	flaminius  sir  a word  pray  is my lord ready to
come forth 


flaminius

no  indeed  he is not 


titus

we attend his lordship  pray  signify so much 


flaminius

i need not tell him that  he knows you are too diligent 
exit
enter flavius in a cloak  muffled
lucilius  servant	ha  is not that his steward muffled so 
he goes away in a cloud  call him  call him 


titus

do you hear  sir 
varro 


second servant

by your leave  sir 


flavius

what do ye ask of me  my friend 


titus

we wait for certain money here  sir 


flavius

ay 
if money were as certain as your waiting 
 sure enough 
why then preferr you not your sums and bills 
when your false masters eat of my lord meat 
then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
and take down the interest into their
gluttonous maws 
you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up 
let me pass quietly 
believe  t  my lord and i have made an end 
i have no more to reckon  he to spend 
lucilius  servant	ay  but this answer will not serve 


flavius

if  not serve not so base as you 
for you serve knaves 
exit
varro 


first servant

how  what does his cashiered worship mutter 
varro 


second servant

no matter what  he poor  and that revenge
enough  who can speak broader than he that has no
house to put his head in  such may rail against
great buildings 
enter servilius


titus

o  here servilius  now we shall know some answer 


servilius

if i might beseech you  gentlemen  to repair some
other hour  i should derive much from t  for 
take of my soul  my lord leans wondrously to
discontent  his comfortable temper has forsook him 
he much out of health  and keeps his chamber 
lucilius  servant  many do keep their chambers are not sick 
and  if it be so far beyond his health 
methinks he should the sooner pay his debts 
and make a clear way to the gods 


servilius

good gods 


titus

we cannot take this for answer  sir 


flaminius

 within   servilius  help  my lord  my lord 
enter timon  in a rage  flaminius following


timon

what  are my doors opposed against my passage 
have i been ever free  and must my house
be my retentive enemy  my gaol 
the place which i have feasted  does it now 
like all mankind  show me an iron heart 
lucilius  servant	put in now  titus 


titus

my lord  here is my bill 
lucilius  servant	here mine 


hortensius

and mine  my lord

varro servants	and ours  my lord 


philotus

timon

knock me down with  em  cleave me to the girdle 
lucilius  servant	alas  my lord 


timon

cut my heart in sums 


titus

mine  fifty talents 


timon

tell out my blood 
lucilius  servant	five thousand crowns  my lord 


timon

five thousand drops pays that 
what yours and yours 
varro 


first servant

my lord 
varro 


second servant

my lord 


timon

tear me  take me  and the gods fall upon you 
exit


hortensius

 faith  i perceive our masters may throw their caps
at their money  these debts may well be called
desperate ones  for a madman owes  em 
exeunt
re enter timon and flavius

a moderate table
