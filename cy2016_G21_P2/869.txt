scene v  the same  the senate house  the senate sitting 


first senator

my lord  you have my voice to it  the fault 
bloody   necessary he should die 
nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy 


second senator

most true  the law shall bruise him 
enter alcibiades  with attendants


alcibiades

honour  health  and compassion to the senate 


first senator

now  captain 


alcibiades

i am an humble suitor to your virtues 
for pity is the virtue of the law 
and none but tyrants use it cruelly 
it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
upon a friend of mine  who  in hot blood 
hath stepp into the law  which is past depth
to those that  without heed  do plunge into  t 
he is a man  setting his fate aside 
of comely virtues 
nor did he soil the fact with cowardice 
an honour in him which buys out his fault 
but with a noble fury and fair spirit 
seeing his reputation touch to death 
he did oppose his foe 
and with such sober and unnoted passion
he did behave his anger  ere  spent 
as if he had but proved an argument 


first senator

you undergo too strict a paradox 
striving to make an ugly deed look fair 
your words have took such pains as if they labour 
to bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
upon the head of valour  which indeed
is valour misbegot and came into the world
when sects and factions were newly born 
he truly valiant that can wisely suffer
the worst that man can breathe  and make his wrongs
his outsides  to wear them like his raiment 
carelessly 
and ne prefer his injuries to his heart 
to bring it into danger 
if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill 
what folly  to hazard life for ill 


alcibiades

my lord 


first senator

       you cannot make gross sins look clear 
to revenge is no valour  but to bear 


alcibiades

my lords  then  under favour  pardon me 
if i speak like a captain 
why do fond men expose themselves to battle 
and not endure all threats  sleep upon t 
and let the foes quietly cut their throats 
without repugnancy  if there be
such valour in the bearing  what make we
abroad  why then  women are more valiant
that stay at home  if bearing carry it 
and the ass more captain than the lion  the felon
loaden with irons wiser than the judge 
if wisdom be in suffering  o my lords 
as you are great  be pitifully good 
who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood 
to kill  i grant  is sin extremest gust 
but  in defence  by mercy   most just 
to be in anger is impiety 
but who is man that is not angry 
weigh but the crime with this 


second senator

you breathe in vain 


alcibiades

in vain  his service done
at lacedaemon and byzantium
were a sufficient briber for his life 


first senator

what that 


alcibiades

i say  my lords  he has done fair service 
and slain in fight many of your enemies 
how full of valour did he bear himself
in the last conflict  and made plenteous wounds 


second senator

he has made too much plenty with  em 
he a sworn rioter  he has a sin that often
drowns him  and takes his valour prisoner 
if there were no foes  that were enough
to overcome him  in that beastly fury
he has been known to commit outrages 
and cherish factions   inferr to us 
his days are foul and his drink dangerous 


first senator

he dies 


alcibiades

hard fate  he might have died in war 
my lords  if not for any parts in him 
though his right arm might purchase his own time
and be in debt to none yet  more to move you 
take my deserts to his  and join  both 
and  for i know your reverend ages love
security  i pawn my victories  all
my honours to you  upon his good returns 
if by this crime he owes the law his life 
why  let the war receive  in valiant gore
for law is strict  and war is nothing more 


first senator

we are for law  he dies  urge it no more 
on height of our displeasure  friend or brother 
he forfeits his own blood that spills another 


alcibiades

must it be so  it must not be  my lords 
i do beseech you  know me 


second senator

how 


alcibiades

call me to your remembrances 


third senator

what 


alcibiades

i cannot think but your age has forgot me 
it could not else be  i should prove so base 
to sue  and be denied such common grace 
my wounds ache at you 


first senator

do you dare our anger 
 in few words  but spacious in effect 
we banish thee for ever 


alcibiades

banish me 
banish your dotage  banish usury 
that makes the senate ugly 


first senator

if  after two days  shine  athens contain thee 
attend our weightier judgment  and  not to swell
our spirit 
he shall be executed presently 
exeunt senators


alcibiades

now the gods keep you old enough  that you may live
only in bone  that none may look on you 
i worse than mad  i have kept back their foes 
while they have told their money and let out
their coin upon large interest  i myself
rich only in large hurts  all those for this 
is this the balsam that the usuring senate
pours into captains  wounds  banishment 
it comes not ill  i hate not to be banish d 
it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury 
that i may strike at athens  i cheer up
my discontented troops  and lay for hearts 
 honour with most lands to be at odds 
soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods 
exit
