warwick

clifford of cumberland   warwick calls 
and if thou dost not hide thee from the bear 
now  when the angry trumpet sounds alarum
and dead men cries do fill the empty air 
clifford  i say  come forth and fight with me 
proud northern lord  clifford of cumberland 
warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms 
enter york
how now  my noble lord  what  all afoot

as i intend  clifford  to thrive to day

exit


clifford

what seest thou in me  york  why dost thou pause 


york

with thy brave bearing should i be in love 
but that thou art so fast mine enemy 


clifford

nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem 
but that  shown ignobly and in treason 


york

so let it help me now against thy sword
as i in justice and true right express it 


clifford

my soul and body on the action both 


york

a dreadful lay  address thee instantly 
they fight  and clifford falls

young clifford

shame and confusion  all is on the rout 
fear frames disorder  and disorder wounds
where it should guard  o war  thou son of hell 
whom angry heavens do make their minister
throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
hot coals of vengeance  let no soldier fly 
he that is truly dedicate to war
hath no self love  nor he that loves himself
hath not essentially but by circumstance
the name of valour 
seeing his dead father
o  let the vile world end 
and the premised flames of the last day
knit earth and heaven together 
now let the general trumpet blow his blast 
particularities and petty sounds
to cease  wast thou ordain d  dear father 
to lose thy youth in peace  and to achieve
the silver livery of advised age 
and  in thy reverence and thy chair days  thus
to die in ruffian battle  even at this sight
my heart is turn to stone  and while  mine 
it shall be stony  york not our old men spares 
no more will i their babes  tears virginal
shall be to me even as the dew to fire 
and beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax 
henceforth i will not have to do with pity 
meet i an infant of the house of york 
into as many gobbets will i cut it
as wild medea young absyrtus did 
in cruelty will i seek out my fame 
come  thou new ruin of old clifford house 
as did aeneas old anchises bear 
so bear i thee upon my manly shoulders 
but then aeneas bare a living load 
nothing so heavy as these woes of mine 
exit  bearing off his father
enter richard and somerset to fight  somerset is killed


richard

so  lie thou there 
for underneath an alehouse  paltry sign 
the castle in saint alban s  somerset
hath made the wizard famous in his death 
sword  hold thy temper  heart  be wrathful still 
priests pray for enemies  but princes kill 
exit

queen margaret

what are you made of  you nor fight nor fly 
now is it manhood  wisdom and defence 
to give the enemy way  and to secure us
by what we can  which can no more but fly 
alarum afar off
if you be ta en  we then should see the bottom
of all our fortunes  but if we haply scape 
as well we may  if not through your neglect 
we shall to london get  where you are loved
and where this breach now in our fortunes made
may readily be stopp d 
re enter young clifford


young clifford

but that my heart on future mischief set 
i would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly 
but fly you must  uncurable discomfit
reigns in the hearts of all our present parts 
away  for your relief  and we will live
to see their day and them our fortune give 
away  my lord  away
