scene vi  the same  a banqueting room in timon house 


music  tables set out  servants attending   enter divers lords  senators and others  at several doors


first lord

the good time of day to you  sir 


second lord

i also wish it to you  i think this honourable lord
did but try us this other day 


first lord

upon that were my thoughts tiring  when we
encountered  i hope it is not so low with him as
he made it seem in the trial of his several friends 


second lord

it should not be  by the persuasion of his new feasting 


first lord

i should think so  he hath sent me an earnest
inviting  which many my near occasions did urge me
to put off  but he hath conjured me beyond them  and
i must needs appear 


second lord

in like manner was i in debt to my importunate
business  but he would not hear my excuse  i am
sorry  when he sent to borrow of me  that my
provision was out 


first lord

i am sick of that grief too  as i understand how all
things go 


second lord

every man here so  what would he have borrowed of
you 


first lord

a thousand pieces 


second lord

a thousand pieces 


first lord

what of you 


second lord

he sent to me  sir here he comes 
enter timon and attendants


timon

with all my heart  gentlemen both  and how fare you 


first lord

ever at the best  hearing well of your lordship 


second lord

the swallow follows not summer more willing than we
your lordship 


timon

 aside   nor more willingly leaves winter  such
summer birds are men  gentlemen  our dinner will not
recompense this long stay  feast your ears with the
music awhile  if they will fare so harshly o  the
trumpet sound  we shall to  presently 


first lord

i hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
that i returned you an empty messenger 


timon

o  sir  let it not trouble you 


second lord

my noble lord 


timon

ah  my good friend  what cheer 


second lord

my most honourable lord  i am e sick of shame 
that  when your lordship this other day sent to me 
i was so unfortunate a beggar 


timon

think not on  t  sir 


second lord

if you had sent but two hours before 


timon

let it not cumber your better remembrance 
the banquet brought in
come  bring in all together 


second lord

all covered dishes 


first lord

royal cheer  i warrant you 


third lord

doubt not that  if money and the season can yield
it 


first lord

how do you  what the news 


third lord

alcibiades is banished  hear you of it 


first lord

second lord

alcibiades banished 


third lord

 so  be sure of it 


first lord

how  how 


second lord

i pray you  upon what 


timon

my worthy friends  will you draw near 


third lord

i tell you more anon  here a noble feast toward 


second lord

this is the old man still 


third lord

will  hold  will  hold 


second lord

it does  but time will and so 


third lord

i do conceive 


timon

each man to his stool  with that spur as he would to
the lip of his mistress  your diet shall be in all
places alike  make not a city feast of it  to let
the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place 
sit  sit  the gods require our thanks 
you great benefactors  sprinkle our society with
thankfulness  for your own gifts  make yourselves
praised  but reserve still to give  lest your
deities be despised  lend to each man enough  that
one need not lend to another  for  were your
godheads to borrow of men  men would forsake the
gods  make the meat be beloved more than the man
that gives it  let no assembly of twenty be without
a score of villains  if there sit twelve women at
the table  let a dozen of them be as they are  the
rest of your fees  o gods the senators of athens 
together with the common lag of people what is
amiss in them  you gods  make suitable for
destruction  for these my present friends  as they
are to me nothing  so in nothing bless them  and to
nothing are they welcome 
uncover  dogs  and lap 
the dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water


some speak

what does his lordship mean 


some others

i know not 


timon

may you a better feast never behold 
you knot of mouth friends i smoke and lukewarm water
is your perfection  this is timon last 
who  stuck and spangled with your flatteries 
washes it off  and sprinkles in your faces
your reeking villany 
throwing the water in their faces
live loathed and long 
most smiling  smooth  detested parasites 
courteous destroyers  affable wolves  meek bears 
you fools of fortune  trencher friends  time flies 
cap and knee slaves  vapours  and minute jacks 
of man and beast the infinite malady
crust you quite o er  what  dost thou go 
soft  take thy physic first thou too and thou 
stay  i will lend thee money  borrow none 
throws the dishes at them  and drives them out
what  all in motion  henceforth be no feast 
whereat a villain not a welcome guest 
burn  house  sink  athens  henceforth hated be
of timon man and all humanity 
exit
re enter the lords  senators     c


first lord

how now  my lords 


second lord

know you the quality of lord timon fury 


third lord

push  did you see my cap 


fourth lord

i have lost my gown 


first lord

he but a mad lord  and nought but humour sways him 
he gave me a jewel th  other day  and now he has
beat it out of my hat  did you see my jewel 


third lord

did you see my cap 


second lord

here  tis
