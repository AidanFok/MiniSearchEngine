scene ii  athens  a room in timon house 


enter flavius  with two or three servants


first servant

hear you  master steward  where our master 
are we undone  cast off  nothing remaining 


flavius

alack  my fellows  what should i say to you 
let me be recorded by the righteous gods 
i am as poor as you 


first servant

such a house broke 
so noble a master fall n  all gone  and not
one friend to take his fortune by the arm 
and go along with him 


second servant

as we do turn our backs
from our companion thrown into his grave 
so his familiars to his buried fortunes
slink all away  leave their false vows with him 
like empty purses pick d  and his poor self 
a dedicated beggar to the air 
with his disease of all shunn poverty 
walks  like contempt  alone  more of our fellows 
enter other servants


flavius

all broken implements of a ruin house 


third servant

yet do our hearts wear timon livery 
that see i by our faces  we are fellows still 
serving alike in sorrow  leak is our bark 
and we  poor mates  stand on the dying deck 
hearing the surges threat  we must all part
into this sea of air 


flavius

good fellows all 
the latest of my wealth i share amongst you 
wherever we shall meet  for timon sake 
let yet be fellows  let shake our heads  and say 
as  a knell unto our master fortunes 
 have seen better days  let each take some 
nay  put out all your hands  not one word more 
thus part we rich in sorrow  parting poor 
servants embrace  and part several ways
o  the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us 
who would not wish to be from wealth exempt 
since riches point to misery and contempt 
who would be so mock with glory  or to live
but in a dream of friendship 
to have his pomp and all what state compounds
but only painted  like his varnish friends 
poor honest lord  brought low by his own heart 
undone by goodness  strange  unusual blood 
when man worst sin is  he does too much good 
who  then  dares to be half so kind again 
for bounty  that makes gods  does still mar men 
my dearest lord  bless d  to be most accursed 
rich  only to be wretched  thy great fortunes
are made thy chief afflictions  alas  kind lord 
he flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
of monstrous friends  nor has he with him to
supply his life  or that which can command it 
i follow and inquire him out 
i ever serve his mind with my best will 
whilst i have gold  i be his steward still 
exit
