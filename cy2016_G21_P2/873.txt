scene iii  woods and cave  near the seashore 


enter timon  from the cave


o blessed breeding sun  draw from the earth
rotten humidity  below thy sister orb
infect the air  twinn brothers of one womb 
whose procreation  residence  and birth 
scarce is dividant  touch them with several fortunes 
the greater scorns the lesser  not nature 
to whom all sores lay siege  can bear great fortune 
but by contempt of nature 
raise me this beggar  and deny  that lord 
the senator shall bear contempt hereditary 
the beggar native honour 
it is the pasture lards the rother sides 
the want that makes him lean  who dares  who dares 
in purity of manhood stand upright 
and say  man a flatterer  if one be 
so are they all  for every grise of fortune
is smooth by that below  the learned pate
ducks to the golden fool  all is oblique 
there nothing level in our cursed natures 
but direct villany  therefore  be abhorr 
all feasts  societies  and throngs of men 
his semblable  yea  himself  timon disdains 
destruction fang mankind  earth  yield me roots 
digging
who seeks for better of thee  sauce his palate
with thy most operant poison  what is here 
gold  yellow  glittering  precious gold  no  gods 
i am no idle votarist  roots  you clear heavens 
thus much of this will make black white  foul fair 
wrong right  base noble  old young  coward valiant 
ha  you gods  why this  what this  you gods  why  this
will lug your priests and servants from your sides 
pluck stout men pillows from below their heads 
this yellow slave
will knit and break religions  bless the accursed 
make the hoar leprosy adored  place thieves
and give them title  knee and approbation
with senators on the bench  this is it
that makes the wappen widow wed again 
she  whom the spital house and ulcerous sores
would cast the gorge at  this embalms and spices
to the april day again  come  damned earth 
thou common whore of mankind  that put odds
among the route of nations  i will make thee
do thy right nature 
march afar off
ha  a drum   thou quick 
but yet i bury thee  thou go  strong thief 
when gouty keepers of thee cannot stand 
nay  stay thou out for earnest 
keeping some gold
enter alcibiades  with drum and fife  in warlike manner  phrynia and timandra


alcibiades

what art thou there  speak 


timon

a beast  as thou art  the canker gnaw thy heart 
for showing me again the eyes of man 


alcibiades

what is thy name  is man so hateful to thee 
that art thyself a man 


timon

i am misanthropos  and hate mankind 
for thy part  i do wish thou wert a dog 
that i might love thee something 


alcibiades

i know thee well 
but in thy fortunes am unlearn and strange 


timon

i know thee too  and more than that i know thee 
i not desire to know  follow thy drum 
with man blood paint the ground  gules  gules 
religious canons  civil laws are cruel 
then what should war be  this fell whore of thine
hath in her more destruction than thy sword 
for all her cherubim look 


phrynia

thy lips rot off 


timon

i will not kiss thee  then the rot returns
to thine own lips again 


alcibiades

how came the noble timon to this change 


timon

as the moon does  by wanting light to give 
but then renew i could not  like the moon 
there were no suns to borrow of 


alcibiades

noble timon 
what friendship may i do thee 


timon

none  but to
maintain my opinion 


alcibiades

what is it  timon 


timon

promise me friendship  but perform none  if thou
wilt not promise  the gods plague thee  for thou art
a man  if thou dost perform  confound thee  for
thou art a man 


alcibiades

i have heard in some sort of thy miseries 


timon

thou saw them  when i had prosperity 


alcibiades

i see them now  then was a blessed time 


timon

as thine is now  held with a brace of harlots 


timandra

is this the athenian minion  whom the world
voiced so regardfully 


timon

art thou timandra 


timandra

yes 


timon

be a whore still  they love thee not that use thee 
give them diseases  leaving with thee their lust 
make use of thy salt hours  season the slaves
for tubs and baths  bring down rose cheeked youth
to the tub fast and the diet 


timandra

hang thee  monster 


alcibiades

pardon him  sweet timandra  for his wits
are drown and lost in his calamities 
i have but little gold of late  brave timon 
the want whereof doth daily make revolt
in my penurious band  i have heard  and grieved 
how cursed athens  mindless of thy worth 
forgetting thy great deeds  when neighbour states 
but for thy sword and fortune  trod upon them 


timon

i prithee  beat thy drum  and get thee gone 


alcibiades

i am thy friend  and pity thee  dear timon 


timon

how dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble 
i had rather be alone 


alcibiades

why  fare thee well 
here is some gold for thee 


timon

keep it  i cannot eat it 


alcibiades

when i have laid proud athens on a heap 


timon

warr thou  athens 


alcibiades

ay  timon  and have cause 


timon

the gods confound them all in thy conquest 
and thee after  when thou hast conquer d 


alcibiades

why me  timon 


timon

                  that  by killing of villains 
thou wast born to conquer my country 
put up thy gold  go on here gold go on 
be as a planetary plague  when jove
will o some high viced city hang his poison
in the sick air  let not thy sword skip one 
pity not honour age for his white beard 
he is an usurer  strike me the counterfeit matron 
it is her habit only that is honest 
herself a bawd  let not the virgin cheek
make soft thy trenchant sword  for those milk paps 
that through the window bars bore at men eyes 
are not within the leaf of pity writ 
but set them down horrible traitors  spare not the babe 
whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy 
think it a bastard  whom the oracle
hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut 
and mince it sans remorse  swear against objects 
put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes 
whose proof  nor yells of mothers  maids  nor babes 
nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding 
shall pierce a jot  there gold to pay soldiers 
make large confusion  and  thy fury spent 
confounded be thyself  speak not  be gone 


alcibiades

hast thou gold yet  i take the gold thou
givest me 
not all thy counsel 


timon

dost thou  or dost thou not  heaven curse
upon thee 


phrynia

timandra

give us some gold  good timon  hast thou more 


timon

enough to make a whore forswear her trade 
and to make whores  a bawd  hold up  you sluts 
your aprons mountant  you are not oathable 
although  i know  you  swear  terribly swear
into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
the immortal gods that hear you spare your oaths 
i trust to your conditions  be whores still 
and he whose pious breath seeks to convert you 
be strong in whore  allure him  burn him up 
let your close fire predominate his smoke 
and be no turncoats  yet may your pains  six months 
be quite contrary  and thatch your poor thin roofs
with burthens of the dead some that were hang d 
no matter wear them  betray with them  whore still 
paint till a horse may mire upon your face 
a pox of wrinkles 


phrynia

timandra

well  more gold  what then 
believe t  that we do any thing for gold 


timon

consumptions sow
in hollow bones of man  strike their sharp shins 
and mar men spurring  crack the lawyer voice 
that he may never more false title plead 
nor sound his quillets shrilly  hoar the flamen 
that scolds against the quality of flesh 
and not believes himself  down with the nose 
down with it flat  take the bridge quite away
of him that  his particular to foresee 
smells from the general weal  make curl d pate
ruffians bald 
and let the unscarr braggarts of the war
derive some pain from you  plague all 
that your activity may defeat and quell
the source of all erection  there more gold 
do you damn others  and let this damn you 
and ditches grave you all 


phrynia

timandra

more counsel with more money  bounteous timon 


timon

more whore  more mischief first  i have given you earnest 


alcibiades

strike up the drum towards athens  farewell  timon 
if i thrive well  i visit thee again 


timon

if i hope well  i never see thee more 


alcibiades

i never did thee harm 


timon

yes  thou spokest well of me 


alcibiades

call thou that harm 


timon

thy beagles with thee

that nature  being sick of man unkindness 
should yet be hungry  common mother  thou 
digging
whose womb unmeasurable  and infinite breast 
teems  and feeds all  whose self same mettle 
whereof thy proud child  arrogant man  is puff d 
engenders the black toad and adder blue 
the gilded newt and eyeless venom worm 
with all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
whereon hyperion quickening fire doth shine 
yield him  who all thy human sons doth hate 
from forth thy plenteous bosom  one poor root 
ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb 
let it no more bring out ingrateful man 
go great with tigers  dragons  wolves  and bears 
teem with new monsters  whom thy upward face
hath to the marbled mansion all above
never presented o  a root dear thanks 
dry up thy marrows  vines  and plough torn leas 
whereof ungrateful man  with liquorish draughts
and morsels unctuous  greases his pure mind 
that from it all consideration slips 
enter apemantus
more man  plague  plague 


apemantus

i was directed hither  men report
thou dost affect my manners  and dost use them 


timon

 tis  then  because thou dost not keep a dog 
whom i would imitate  consumption catch thee 


apemantus

this is in thee a nature but infected 
a poor unmanly melancholy sprung
from change of fortune  why this spade  this place 
this slave like habit  and these looks of care 
thy flatterers yet wear silk  drink wine  lie soft 
hug their diseased perfumes  and have forgot
that ever timon was  shame not these woods 
by putting on the cunning of a carper 
be thou a flatterer now  and seek to thrive
by that which has undone thee  hinge thy knee 
and let his very breath  whom thou observe 
blow off thy cap  praise his most vicious strain 
and call it excellent  thou wast told thus 
thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
to knaves and all approachers   most just
that thou turn rascal  hadst thou wealth again 
rascals should have  t  do not assume my likeness 


timon

were i like thee  i throw away myself 


apemantus

thou hast cast away thyself  being like thyself 
a madman so long  now a fool  what  think 
that the bleak air  thy boisterous chamberlain 
will put thy shirt on warm  will these moss trees 
that have outlived the eagle  page thy heels 
and skip where thou point out  will the
cold brook 
candied with ice  caudle thy morning taste 
to cure thy o er night surfeit  call the creatures
whose naked natures live in an the spite
of wreakful heaven  whose bare unhoused trunks 
to the conflicting elements exposed 
answer mere nature  bid them flatter thee 
o  thou shalt find 


timon

a fool of thee  depart 


apemantus

i love thee better now than e i did 


timon

i hate thee worse 


apemantus

                  why 


timon

thou flatter misery 


apemantus

i flatter not  but say thou art a caitiff 


timon

why dost thou seek me out 


apemantus

to vex thee 


timon

always a villain office or a fool s 
dost please thyself in t 


apemantus

ay 


timon

what  a knave too 


apemantus

if thou didst put this sour cold habit on
to castigate thy pride   well  but thou
dost it enforcedly  thou courtier be again 
wert thou not beggar  willing misery
outlives encertain pomp  is crown before 
the one is filling still  never complete 
the other  at high wish  best state  contentless 
hath a distracted and most wretched being 
worse than the worst  content 
thou shouldst desire to die  being miserable 


timon

not by his breath that is more miserable 
thou art a slave  whom fortune tender arm
with favour never clasp d  but bred a dog 
hadst thou  like us from our first swath  proceeded
the sweet degrees that this brief world affords
to such as may the passive drugs of it
freely command  thou wouldst have plunged thyself
in general riot  melted down thy youth
in different beds of lust  and never learn 
the icy precepts of respect  but follow 
the sugar game before thee  but myself 
who had the world as my confectionary 
the mouths  the tongues  the eyes and hearts of men
at duty  more than i could frame employment 
that numberless upon me stuck as leaves
do on the oak  hive with one winter brush
fell from their boughs and left me open  bare
for every storm that blows  i  to bear this 
that never knew but better  is some burden 
thy nature did commence in sufferance  time
hath made thee hard in t  why shouldst thou hate men 
they never flatter thee  what hast thou given 
if thou wilt curse  thy father  that poor rag 
must be thy subject  who in spite put stuff
to some she beggar and compounded thee
poor rogue hereditary  hence  be gone 
if thou hadst not been born the worst of men 
thou hadst been a knave and flatterer 


apemantus

art thou proud yet 


timon

ay  that i am not thee 


apemantus

i  that i was
no prodigal 


timon

                  i  that i am one now 
were all the wealth i have shut up in thee 
i give thee leave to hang it  get thee gone 
that the whole life of athens were in this 
thus would i eat it 
eating a root


apemantus

here  i will mend thy feast 
offering him a root


timon

first mend my company  take away thyself 


apemantus

so i shall mend mine own  by the lack of thine 


timon

 not well mended so  it is but botch d 
if not  i would it were 


apemantus

what wouldst thou have to athens 


timon

thee thither in a whirlwind  if thou wilt 
tell them there i have gold  look  so i have 


apemantus

here is no use for gold 


timon

the best and truest 
for here it sleeps  and does no hired harm 


apemantus

where liest o  nights  timon 


timon

under that above me 
where feed thou o  days  apemantus 


apemantus

where my stomach finds meat  or  rather  where i eat
it 


timon

would poison were obedient and knew my mind 


apemantus

where wouldst thou send it 


timon

to sauce thy dishes 


apemantus

the middle of humanity thou never knewest  but the
extremity of both ends  when thou wast in thy gilt
and thy perfume  they mocked thee for too much
curiosity  in thy rags thou knowest none  but art
despised for the contrary  there a medlar for
thee  eat it 


timon

on what i hate i feed not 


apemantus

dost hate a medlar 


timon

ay  though it look like thee 


apemantus

an thou hadst hated meddlers sooner  thou shouldst
have loved thyself better now  what man didst thou
ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means 


timon

who  without those means thou talkest of  didst thou
ever know beloved 


apemantus

myself 


timon

i understand thee  thou hadst some means to keep a
dog 


apemantus

what things in the world canst thou nearest compare
to thy flatterers 


timon

women nearest  but men  men are the things
themselves  what wouldst thou do with the world 
apemantus  if it lay in thy power 


apemantus

give it the beasts  to be rid of the men 


timon

wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
men  and remain a beast with the beasts 


apemantus

ay  timon 


timon

a beastly ambition  which the gods grant thee t 
attain to  if thou wert the lion  the fox would
beguile thee  if thou wert the lamb  the fox would
eat three  if thou wert the fox  the lion would
suspect thee  when peradventure thou wert accused by
the ass  if thou wert the ass  thy dulness would
torment thee  and still thou livedst but as a
breakfast to the wolf  if thou wert the wolf  thy
greediness would afflict thee  and oft thou shouldst
hazard thy life for thy dinner  wert thou the
unicorn  pride and wrath would confound thee and
make thine own self the conquest of thy fury  wert
thou a bear  thou wouldst be killed by the horse 
wert thou a horse  thou wouldst be seized by the
leopard  wert thou a leopard  thou wert german to
the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
thy life  all thy safety were remotion and thy
defence absence  what beast couldst thou be  that
were not subject to a beast  and what a beast art
thou already  that seest not thy loss in
transformation 


apemantus

if thou couldst please me with speaking to me  thou
mightst have hit upon it here  the commonwealth of
athens is become a forest of beasts 


timon

how has the ass broke the wall  that thou art out of the city 


apemantus

yonder comes a poet and a painter  the plague of
company light upon thee  i will fear to catch it
and give way  when i know not what else to do  i 
see thee again 


timon

when there is nothing living but thee  thou shalt be
welcome  i had rather be a beggar dog than apemantus 


apemantus

thou art the cap of all the fools alive 


timon

would thou wert clean enough to spit upon 


apemantus

a plague on thee  thou art too bad to curse 


timon

all villains that do stand by thee are pure 


apemantus

there is no leprosy but what thou speak st 


timon

if i name thee 
i beat thee  but i should infect my hands 


apemantus

i would my tongue could rot them off 


timon

away  thou issue of a mangy dog 
choler does kill me that thou art alive 
i swound to see thee 


apemantus

that death in me at others  lives may laugh

 natural son and sire  thou bright defiler
of hymen purest bed  thou valiant mars

flinty mankind  whose eyes do never give
but thorough lust and laughter  pity sleeping 
strange times  that weep with laughing  not with weeping

i beg of you to know me  good my lord 
to accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
to entertain me as your steward still 


timon

had i a steward
so true  so just  and now so comfortable 
it almost turns my dangerous nature mild 
let me behold thy face  surely  this man
was born of woman 
forgive my general and exceptless rashness 
you perpetual sober gods  i do proclaim
one honest man mistake me not but one 
no more  i pray and he a steward 
how fain would i have hated all mankind 
and thou redeem thyself  but all  save thee 
i fell with curses 
methinks thou art more honest now than wise 
for  by oppressing and betraying me 
thou mightst have sooner got another service 
for many so arrive at second masters 
upon their first lord neck  but tell me true 
for i must ever doubt  though ne so sure 
is not thy kindness subtle  covetous 
if not a usuring kindness  and  as rich men deal gifts 
expecting in return twenty for one 


flavius

no  my most worthy master  in whose breast
doubt and suspect  alas  are placed too late 
you should have fear false times when you did feast 
suspect still comes where an estate is least 
that which i show  heaven knows  is merely love 
duty and zeal to your unmatched mind 
care of your food and living  and  believe it 
my most honour lord 
for any benefit that points to me 
either in hope or present  i exchange
for this one wish  that you had power and wealth
to requite me  by making rich yourself 


timon

look thee   so  thou singly honest man 
here  take  the gods out of my misery
have sent thee treasure  go  live rich and happy 
but thus condition d  thou shalt build from men 
hate all  curse all  show charity to none 
but let the famish flesh slide from the bone 
ere thou relieve the beggar  give to dogs
what thou deny to men  let prisons swallow  em 
debts wither  to nothing  be men like
blasted woods 
and may diseases lick up their false bloods 
and so farewell and thrive 


flavius

o  let me stay 
and comfort you  my master 


timon

if thou hatest curses 
stay not  fly  whilst thou art blest and free 
ne see thou man  and let me ne see thee 
exit flavius  timon retires to his cave
