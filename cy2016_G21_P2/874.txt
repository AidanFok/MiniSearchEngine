scene i  the woods  before timon cave 


enter poet and painter  timon watching them from his cave


painter

as i took note of the place  it cannot be far where
he abides 


poet

what to be thought of him  does the rumour hold
for true  that he so full of gold 


painter

certain  alcibiades reports it  phrynia and
timandra had gold of him  he likewise enriched poor
straggling soldiers with great quantity   said
he gave unto his steward a mighty sum 


poet

then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends 


painter

nothing else  you shall see him a palm in athens
again  and flourish with the highest  therefore
 not amiss we tender our loves to him  in this
supposed distress of his  it will show honestly in
us  and is very likely to load our purposes with
what they travail for  if it be a just true report
that goes of his having 


poet

what have you now to present unto him 


painter

nothing at this time but my visitation  only i will
promise him an excellent piece 


poet

i must serve him so too  tell him of an intent
that coming toward him 


painter

good as the best  promising is the very air o  the
time  it opens the eyes of expectation 
performance is ever the duller for his act  and 
but in the plainer and simpler kind of people  the
deed of saying is quite out of use  to promise is
most courtly and fashionable  performance is a kind
of will or testament which argues a great sickness
in his judgment that makes it 
timon comes from his cave  behind


timon

 aside   excellent workman  thou canst not paint a
man so bad as is thyself 


poet

i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for
him  it must be a personating of himself  a satire
against the softness of prosperity  with a discovery
of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency 


timon

 aside   must thou needs stand for a villain in
thine own work  wilt thou whip thine own faults in
other men  do so  i have gold for thee 


poet

nay  let seek him 
then do we sin against our own estate 
when we may profit meet  and come too late 


painter

true 
when the day serves  before black corner night 
find what thou want by free and offer light  come 


timon

 aside   i meet you at the turn  what a
god gold 
that he is worshipp in a baser temple
than where swine feed 
 thou that rigg the bark and plough the foam 
settlest admired reverence in a slave 
to thee be worship  and thy saints for aye
be crown with plagues that thee alone obey 
fit i meet them 
coming forward


poet

hail  worthy timon 


painter

our late noble master 


timon

have i once lived to see two honest men 


poet

sir 
having often of your open bounty tasted 
hearing you were retired  your friends fall off 
whose thankless natures o abhorred spirits 
not all the whips of heaven are large enough 
what  to you 
whose star like nobleness gave life and influence
to their whole being  i am rapt and cannot cover
the monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
with any size of words 


timon

let it go naked  men may see the better 
you that are honest  by being what you are 
make them best seen and known 


painter

he and myself
have travail in the great shower of your gifts 
and sweetly felt it 


timon

ay  you are honest men 


painter

we are hither come to offer you our service 


timon

most honest men  why  how shall i requite you 
can you eat roots  and drink cold water  no 


both

what we can do  we do  to do you service 


timon

ye honest men  ye heard that i have gold 
i am sure you have  speak truth  ye honest men 


painter

so it is said  my noble lord  but therefore
came not my friend nor i 


timon

good honest men  thou draw a counterfeit
best in all athens  thou rt  indeed  the best 
thou counterfeit most lively 


painter

so  so  my lord 


timon

e so  sir  as i say  and  for thy fiction 
why  thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
that thou art even natural in thine art 
but  for all this  my honest natured friends 
i must needs say you have a little fault 
marry   not monstrous in you  neither wish i
you take much pains to mend 


both

beseech your honour
to make it known to us 


timon

you take it ill 


both

most thankfully  my lord 


timon

will you  indeed 


both

doubt it not  worthy lord 


timon

there never a one of you but trusts a knave 
that mightily deceives you 


both

do we  my lord 


timon

ay  and you hear him cog  see him dissemble 
know his gross patchery  love him  feed him 
keep in your bosom  yet remain assured
that he a made up villain 


painter

i know none such  my lord 


poet

nor i 


timon

look you  i love you well  i give you gold 
rid me these villains from your companies 
hang them or stab them  drown them in a draught 
confound them by some course  and come to me 
i give you gold enough 


both

name them  my lord  let know them 


timon

you that way and you this  but two in company 
each man apart  all single and alone 
yet an arch villain keeps him company 
if where thou art two villains shall not be 
come not near him  if thou wouldst not reside
but where one villain is  then him abandon 
hence  pack  there gold  you came for gold  ye slaves 
to painter
you have work for me  there payment for you  hence 
to poet
you are an alchemist  make gold of that 
out  rascal dogs 
beats them out  and then retires to his cave
enter flavius and two senators


flavius

it is in vain that you would speak with timon 
for he is set so only to himself
that nothing but himself which looks like man
is friendly with him 


first senator

bring us to his cave 
it is our part and promise to the athenians
to speak with timon 


second senator

at all times alike
men are not still the same   time and griefs
that framed him thus  time  with his fairer hand 
offering the fortunes of his former days 
the former man may make him  bring us to him 
and chance it as it may 


flavius

here is his cave 
peace and content be here  lord timon  timon 
look out  and speak to friends  the athenians 
by two of their most reverend senate  greet thee 
speak to them  noble timon 
timon comes from his cave


timon

thou sun  that comfort st  burn  speak  and
be hang d 
for each true word  a blister  and each false
be as cauterizing to the root o  the tongue 
consuming it with speaking 


first senator

worthy timon 


timon

of none but such as you  and you of timon 


first senator

the senators of athens greet thee  timon 


timon

i thank them  and would send them back the plague 
could i but catch it for them 


first senator

o  forget
what we are sorry for ourselves in thee 
the senators with one consent of love
entreat thee back to athens  who have thought
on special dignities  which vacant lie
for thy best use and wearing 


second senator

they confess
toward thee forgetfulness too general  gross 
which now the public body  which doth seldom
play the recanter  feeling in itself
a lack of timon aid  hath sense withal
of its own fail  restraining aid to timon 
and send forth us  to make their sorrow render 
together with a recompense more fruitful
than their offence can weigh down by the dram 
ay  even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
as shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
and write in thee the figures of their love 
ever to read them thine 


timon

you witch me in it 
surprise me to the very brink of tears 
lend me a fool heart and a woman eyes 
and i beweep these comforts  worthy senators 


first senator

therefore  so please thee to return with us
and of our athens  thine and ours  to take
the captainship  thou shalt be met with thanks 
allow with absolute power and thy good name
live with authority  so soon we shall drive back
of alcibiades the approaches wild 
who  like a boar too savage  doth root up
his country peace 


second senator

and shakes his threatening sword
against the walls of athens 


first senator

therefore  timon 


timon

well  sir  i will  therefore  i will  sir  thus 
if alcibiades kill my countrymen 
let alcibiades know this of timon 
that timon cares not  but if be sack fair athens 
and take our goodly aged men by the beards 
giving our holy virgins to the stain
of contumelious  beastly  mad brain war 
then let him know  and tell him timon speaks it 
in pity of our aged and our youth 
i cannot choose but tell him  that i care not 
and let him take at worst  for their knives care not 
while you have throats to answer  for myself 
there not a whittle in the unruly camp
but i do prize it at my love before
the reverend throat in athens  so i leave you
to the protection of the prosperous gods 
as thieves to keepers 


flavius

stay not  all in vain 


timon

why  i was writing of my epitaph 
it will be seen to morrow  my long sickness
of health and living now begins to mend 
and nothing brings me all things  go  live still 
be alcibiades your plague  you his 
and last so long enough 


first senator

we speak in vain 


timon

but yet i love my country  and am not
one that rejoices in the common wreck 
as common bruit doth put it 


first senator

that well spoke 


timon

commend me to my loving countrymen 


first senator

these words become your lips as they pass
thorough them 


second senator

and enter in our ears like great triumphers
in their applauding gates 


timon

commend me to them 
and tell them that  to ease them of their griefs 
their fears of hostile strokes  their aches  losses 
their pangs of love  with other incident throes
that nature fragile vessel doth sustain
in life uncertain voyage  i will some kindness do them 
i teach them to prevent wild alcibiades  wrath 


first senator

i like this well  he will return again 


timon

i have a tree  which grows here in my close 
that mine own use invites me to cut down 
and shortly must i fell it  tell my friends 
tell athens  in the sequence of degree
from high to low throughout  that whoso please
to stop affliction  let him take his haste 
come hither  ere my tree hath felt the axe 
and hang himself  i pray you  do my greeting 


flavius

trouble him no further  thus you still shall find him 


timon

come not to me again  but say to athens 
timon hath made his everlasting mansion
upon the beached verge of the salt flood 
who once a day with his embossed froth
the turbulent surge shall cover  thither come 
and let my grave stone be your oracle 
lips  let sour words go by and language end 
what is amiss plague and infection mend 
graves only be men works and death their gain 
sun  hide thy beams  timon hath done his reign 
retires to his cave


first senator

his discontents are unremoveably
coupled to nature 


second senator

our hope in him is dead  let us return 
and strain what other means is left unto us
in our dear peril 


first senator

                  it requires swift foot 
exeunt
