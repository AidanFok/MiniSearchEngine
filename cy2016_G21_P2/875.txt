whom  though in general part we were opposed 
yet our old love made a particular force 
and made us speak like friends  this man was riding
from alcibiades to timon cave 
with letters of entreaty  which imported
his fellowship i  the cause against your city 
in part for his sake moved

the enemies  drum is heard  and fearful scouring
doth choke the air with dust  in  and prepare 
ours is the fall  i fear  our foes the snare
