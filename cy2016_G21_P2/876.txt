soldier

by all description this should be the place 
who here  speak  ho  no answer  what is this 
timon is dead  who hath outstretch his span 
some beast rear this  there does not live a man 
dead  sure  and this his grave  what on this tomb
i cannot read  the character i take with wax 
our captain hath in every figure skill 
an aged interpreter  though young in days 
before proud athens he set down by this 
whose fall the mark of his ambition is 
exit
