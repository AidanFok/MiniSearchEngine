      previous scene


scene iv  before the walls of athens 


trumpets sound  enter alcibiades with his powers


alcibiades

sound to this coward and lascivious town
our terrible approach 
a parley sounded
enter senators on the walls
till now you have gone on and fill the time
with all licentious measure  making your wills
the scope of justice  till now myself and such
as slept within the shadow of your power
hav e wander with our traversed arms and breathed
our sufferance vainly  now the time is flush 
when crouching marrow in the bearer strong
cries of itself  more  now breathless wrong
shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease 
and pursy insolence shall break his wind
with fear and horrid flight 


first senator

noble and young 
when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit 
ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear 
we sent to thee  to give thy rages balm 
to wipe out our ingratitude with loves
above their quantity 


second senator

so did we woo
transformed timon to our city love
by humble message and by promised means 
we were not all unkind  nor all deserve
the common stroke of war 


first senator

these walls of ours
were not erected by their hands from whom
you have received your griefs  nor are they such
that these great towers  trophies and schools
should fall
for private faults in them 


second senator

nor are they living
who were the motives that you first went out 
shame that they wanted cunning  in excess
hath broke their hearts  march  noble lord 
into our city with thy banners spread 
by decimation  and a tithed death 
if thy revenges hunger for that food
which nature loathes take thou the destined tenth 
and by the hazard of the spotted die
let die the spotted 


first senator

all have not offended 
for those that were  it is not square to take
on those that are  revenges  crimes  like lands 
are not inherited  then  dear countryman 
bring in thy ranks  but leave without thy rage 
spare thy athenian cradle and those kin
which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
with those that have offended  like a shepherd 
approach the fold and cull the infected forth 
but kill not all together 


second senator

what thou wilt 
thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
than hew to with thy sword 


first senator 

set but thy foot
against our rampired gates  and they shall ope 
so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before 
to say thou enter friendly 


second senator

throw thy glove 
or any token of thine honour else 
that thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
and not as our confusion  all thy powers
shall make their harbour in our town  till we
have seal thy full desire 


alcibiades

then there my glove 
descend  and open your uncharged ports 
those enemies of timon and mine own
whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
fall and no more  and  to atone your fears
with my more noble meaning  not a man
shall pass his quarter  or offend the stream
of regular justice in your city bounds 
but shall be render to your public laws
at heaviest answer 


both

 most nobly spoken 


alcibiades

descend  and keep your words 
the senators descend  and open the gates
enter soldier


soldier

my noble general  timon is dead 
entomb upon the very hem o  the sea 
and on his grave stone this insculpture  which
with wax i brought away  whose soft impression
interprets for my poor ignorance 


alcibiades

 reads the epitaph    lies a
wretched corse  of wretched soul bereft 
seek not my name  a plague consume you wicked
caitiffs left 
here lie i  timon  who  alive  all living men did hate 
pass by and curse thy fill  but pass and stay
not here thy gait 
these well express in thee thy latter spirits 
though thou abhorr in us our human griefs 
scorn our brain flow and those our
droplets which
from niggard nature fall  yet rich conceit
taught thee to make vast neptune weep for aye
on thy low grave  on faults forgiven  dead
is noble timon  of whose memory
hereafter more  bring me into your city 
and i will use the olive with my sword 
make war breed peace  make peace stint war  make each
prescribe to other as each other leech 
let our drums strike 
exeunt
