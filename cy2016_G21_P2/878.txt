scene i  rome  before the capitol 


the tomb of the andronici appearing  the tribunes  and senators aloft  enter  below  from one side   saturninus and his followers  and  from the other side  bassianus and his followers  with drum and colours


saturninus

noble patricians  patrons of my right 
defend the justice of my cause with arms 
and  countrymen  my loving followers 
plead my successive title with your swords 
i am his first born son  that was the last
that wore the imperial diadem of rome 
then let my father honours live in me 
nor wrong mine age with this indignity 


bassianus

romans  friends  followers  favorers of my right 
if ever bassianus  caesar son 
were gracious in the eyes of royal rome 
keep then this passage to the capitol
and suffer not dishonour to approach
the imperial seat  to virtue consecrate 
to justice  continence and nobility 
but let desert in pure election shine 
and  romans  fight for freedom in your choice 
enter marcus andronicus  aloft  with the crown


marcus andronicus

princes  that strive by factions and by friends
ambitiously for rule and empery 
know that the people of rome  for whom we stand
a special party  have  by common voice 
in election for the roman empery 
chosen andronicus  surnamed pius
for many good and great deserts to rome 
a nobler man  a braver warrior 
lives not this day within the city walls 
he by the senate is accit home
from weary wars against the barbarous goths 
that  with his sons  a terror to our foes 
hath yoked a nation strong  train up in arms 
ten years are spent since first he undertook
this cause of rome and chastised with arms
our enemies  pride  five times he hath return 
bleeding to rome  bearing his valiant sons
in coffins from the field 
and now at last  laden with horror spoils 
returns the good andronicus to rome 
renowned titus  flourishing in arms 
let us entreat  by honour of his name 
whom worthily you would have now succeed 
and in the capitol and senate right 
whom you pretend to honour and adore 
that you withdraw you and abate your strength 
dismiss your followers and  as suitors should 
plead your deserts in peace and humbleness 


saturninus

how fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts 


bassianus

marcus andronicus  so i do ally
in thy uprightness and integrity 
and so i love and honour thee and thine 
thy noble brother titus and his sons 
and her to whom my thoughts are humbled all 
gracious lavinia  rome rich ornament 
that i will here dismiss my loving friends 
and to my fortunes and the people favor
commit my cause in balance to be weigh d 
exeunt the followers of bassianus


saturninus

friends  that have been thus forward in my right 
i thank you all and here dismiss you all 
and to the love and favor of my country
commit myself  my person and the cause 
exeunt the followers of saturninus
rome  be as just and gracious unto me
as i am confident and kind to thee 
open the gates  and let me in 


bassianus

tribunes  and me  a poor competitor 
flourish  saturninus and bassianus go up into the capitol
enter a captain


captain

romans  make way  the good andronicus 
patron of virtue  rome best champion 
successful in the battles that he fights 
with honour and with fortune is return 
from where he circumscribed with his sword 
and brought to yoke  the enemies of rome 
drums and trumpets sounded  enter martius and  mutius  after them  two men bearing a coffin  covered with black  then lucius and quintus  after  them  titus andronicus  and then tamora  with  alarbus  demetrius  chiron  aaron  and other goths   prisoners  soldiers and people following  the bearers set down the coffin  and titus speaks


titus andronicus

hail  rome  victorious in thy mourning weeds 
lo  as the bark  that hath discharged her fraught 
returns with precious jading to the bay
from whence at first she weigh her anchorage 
cometh andronicus  bound with laurel boughs 
to re salute his country with his tears 
tears of true joy for his return to rome 
thou great defender of this capitol 
stand gracious to the rites that we intend 
romans  of five and twenty valiant sons 
half of the number that king priam had 
behold the poor remains  alive and dead 
these that survive let rome reward with love 
these that i bring unto their latest home 
with burial amongst their ancestors 
here goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword 
titus  unkind and careless of thine own 
why suffer thou thy sons  unburied yet 
to hover on the dreadful shore of styx 
make way to lay them by their brethren 
the tomb is opened
there greet in silence  as the dead are wont 
and sleep in peace  slain in your country wars 
o sacred receptacle of my joys 
sweet cell of virtue and nobility 
how many sons of mine hast thou in store 
that thou wilt never render to me more 


lucius

give us the proudest prisoner of the goths 
that we may hew his limbs  and on a pile
ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh 
before this earthy prison of their bones 
that so the shadows be not unappeased 
nor we disturb with prodigies on earth 


titus andronicus

i give him you  the noblest that survives 
the eldest son of this distressed queen 


tamora

stay  roman brethren  gracious conqueror 
victorious titus  rue the tears i shed 
a mother tears in passion for her son 
and if thy sons were ever dear to thee 
o  think my son to be as dear to me 
sufficeth not that we are brought to rome 
to beautify thy triumphs and return 
captive to thee and to thy roman yoke 
but must my sons be slaughter in the streets 
for valiant doings in their country cause 
o  if to fight for king and commonweal
were piety in thine  it is in these 
andronicus  stain not thy tomb with blood 
wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods 
draw near them then in being merciful 
sweet mercy is nobility true badge 
thrice noble titus  spare my first born son 


titus andronicus

patient yourself  madam  and pardon me 
these are their brethren  whom you goths beheld
alive and dead  and for their brethren slain
religiously they ask a sacrifice 
to this your son is mark d  and die he must 
to appease their groaning shadows that are gone 


lucius

away with him  and make a fire straight 
and with our swords  upon a pile of wood 
let hew his limbs till they be clean consumed 
exeunt lucius  quintus  martius  and mutius  with alarbus


tamora

o cruel  irreligious piety 


chiron

was ever scythia half so barbarous 


demetrius

oppose not scythia to ambitious rome 
alarbus goes to rest  and we survive
to tremble under titus  threatening looks 
then  madam  stand resolved  but hope withal
the self same gods that arm the queen of troy
with opportunity of sharp revenge
upon the thracian tyrant in his tent 
may favor tamora  the queen of goths 
when goths were goths and tamora was queen 
to quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes 
re enter lucius  quintus  martius and mutius  with their swords bloody


lucius

see  lord and father  how we have perform 
our roman rites  alarbus  limbs are lopp d 
and entrails feed the sacrificing fire 
whose smoke  like incense  doth perfume the sky 
remaineth nought  but to inter our brethren 
and with loud  welcome them to rome 


titus andronicus

let it be so  and let andronicus
make this his latest farewell to their souls 
trumpets sounded  and the coffin laid in the tomb
in peace and honour rest you here  my sons 
rome readiest champions  repose you here in rest 
secure from worldly chances and mishaps 
here lurks no treason  here no envy swells 
here grow no damned grudges  here are no storms 
no noise  but silence and eternal sleep 
in peace and honour rest you here  my sons

if thou be pleased with this my sudden choice 
behold  i choose thee  tamora  for my bride 
and will create thee empress of rome

and here i swear by all the roman gods 
sith priest and holy water are so near
and tapers burn so bright and every thing
in readiness for hymenaeus stand

yield at entreats  and then let me alone 
i find a day to massacre them all
and raze their faction and their family 
the cruel father and his traitorous sons 
to whom i sued for my dear son life 
and make them know what  to let a queen
kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain
