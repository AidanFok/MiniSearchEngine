the hunt is up  the morn is bright and grey 
the fields are fragrant and the woods are green 
uncouple here and let us make a bay
and wake the emperor and his lovely bride
and rouse the prince and ring a hunter peal 
that all the court may echo with the noise 
sons  let it be your charge  as it is ours 
to attend the emperor person carefully 
i have been troubled in my sleep this night 
but dawning day new comfort hath inspired 
a cry of hounds and horns  winded in a peal  enter  saturninus  tamora  bassianus  lavinia  demetrius  chiron  and attendants
many good morrows to your majesty 
madam  to you as many and as good 
i promised your grace a hunter peal 


saturninus

and you have rung it lustily  my lord 
somewhat too early for new married ladies 


bassianus

lavinia  how say you 


lavinia

i say  no 
i have been broad awake two hours and more 


saturninus

come on  then  horse and chariots let us have 
and to our sport 
to tamora
madam  now shall ye see
our roman hunting 


marcus andronicus

                  i have dogs  my lord 
will rouse the proudest panther in the chase 
and climb the highest promontory top 


titus andronicus

and i have horse will follow where the game
makes way  and run like swallows o the plain 


demetrius

chiron  we hunt not  we  with horse nor hound 
but hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground
