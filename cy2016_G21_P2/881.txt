scene iii  a lonely part of the forest 


enter aaron  with a bag of gold


aaron

he that had wit would think that i had none 
to bury so much gold under a tree 
and never after to inherit it 
let him that thinks of me so abjectly
know that this gold must coin a stratagem 
which  cunningly effected  will beget
a very excellent piece of villany 
and so repose  sweet gold  for their unrest
hides the gold
that have their alms out of the empress  chest 
enter tamora


tamora

my lovely aaron  wherefore look thou sad 
when every thing doth make a gleeful boast 
the birds chant melody on every bush 
the snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun 
the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
and make a chequer shadow on the ground 
under their sweet shade  aaron  let us sit 
and  whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds 
replying shrilly to the well tuned horns 
as if a double hunt were heard at once 
let us sit down and mark their yelping noise 
and  after conflict such as was supposed
the wandering prince and dido once enjoy d 
when with a happy storm they were surprised
and curtain with a counsel keeping cave 
we may  each wreathed in the other arms 
our pastimes done  possess a golden slumber 
whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
be unto us as is a nurse song
of lullaby to bring her babe asleep 


aaron

madam  though venus govern your desires 
saturn is dominator over mine 
what signifies my deadly standing eye 
my silence and my cloudy melancholy 
my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
even as an adder when she doth unroll
to do some fatal execution 
no  madam  these are no venereal signs 
vengeance is in my heart  death in my hand 
blood and revenge are hammering in my head 
hark tamora  the empress of my soul 
which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee 
this is the day of doom for bassianus 
his philomel must lose her tongue to day 
thy sons make pillage of her chastity
and wash their hands in bassianus  blood 
seest thou this letter  take it up  i pray thee 
and give the king this fatal plotted scroll 
now question me no more  we are espied 
here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty 
which dreads not yet their lives  destruction 


tamora

ah  my sweet moor  sweeter to me than life 


aaron

no more  great empress  bassianus comes 
be cross with him  and i go fetch thy sons
to back thy quarrels  whatsoe they be 
exit
enter bassianus and lavinia


bassianus

who have we here  rome royal empress 
unfurnish of her well beseeming troop 
or is it dian  habited like her 
who hath abandoned her holy groves
to see the general hunting in this forest 


tamora

saucy controller of our private steps 
had i the power that some say dian had 
thy temples should be planted presently
with horns  as was actaeon s  and the hounds
should drive upon thy new transformed limbs 
unmannerly intruder as thou art 


lavinia

under your patience  gentle empress 
 thought you have a goodly gift in horning 
and to be doubted that your moor and you
are singled forth to try experiments 
jove shield your husband from his hounds to day 
 pity they should take him for a stag 


bassianus

believe me  queen  your swarth cimmerian
doth make your honour of his body hue 
spotted  detested  and abominable 
why are you sequester from all your train 
dismounted from your snow white goodly steed 
and wander hither to an obscure plot 
accompanied but with a barbarous moor 
if foul desire had not conducted you 


lavinia

and  being intercepted in your sport 
great reason that my noble lord be rated
for sauciness  i pray you  let us hence 
and let her joy her raven colour love 
this valley fits the purpose passing well 


bassianus

the king my brother shall have note of this 


lavinia

ay  for these slips have made him noted long 
good king  to be so mightily abused 


tamora

why have i patience to endure all this 
enter demetrius and chiron


demetrius

how now  dear sovereign  and our gracious mother 
why doth your highness look so pale and wan 


tamora

have i not reason  think you  to look pale 
these two have  me hither to this place 
a barren detested vale  you see it is 
the trees  though summer  yet forlorn and lean 
o with moss and baleful mistletoe 
here never shines the sun  here nothing breeds 
unless the nightly owl or fatal raven 
and when they show me this abhorred pit 
they told me  here  at dead time of the night 
a thousand fiends  a thousand hissing snakes 
ten thousand swelling toads  as many urchins 
would make such fearful and confused cries
as any mortal body hearing it
should straight fall mad  or else die suddenly 
no sooner had they told this hellish tale 
but straight they told me they would bind me here
unto the body of a dismal yew 
and leave me to this miserable death 
and then they call me foul adulteress 
lascivious goth  and all the bitterest terms
that ever ear did hear to such effect 
and  had you not by wondrous fortune come 
this vengeance on me had they executed 
revenge it  as you love your mother life 
or be ye not henceforth call my children 


demetrius

this is a witness that i am thy son 
stabs bassianus


chiron

and this for me  struck home to show my strength 
also stabs bassianus  who dies


lavinia

ay  come  semiramis  nay  barbarous tamora 
for no name fits thy nature but thy own 


tamora

give me thy poniard  you shall know  my boys
your mother hand shall right your mother wrong 


demetrius

stay  madam  here is more belongs to her 
first thrash the corn  then after burn the straw 
this minion stood upon her chastity 
upon her nuptial vow  her loyalty 
and with that painted hope braves your mightiness 
and shall she carry this unto her grave 


chiron

an if she do  i would i were an eunuch 
drag hence her husband to some secret hole 
and make his dead trunk pillow to our lust 


tamora

but when ye have the honey ye desire 
let not this wasp outlive  us both to sting 


chiron

i warrant you  madam  we wil l make that sure 
come  mistress  now perforce we will enjoy
that nice preserved honesty of yours 


lavinia

o tamora  thou bear a woman face 


tamora

i will not hear her speak  away with her 


lavinia

sweet lords  entreat her hear me but a word 


demetrius

listen  fair madam  let it be your glory
to see her tears  but be your heart to them
as unrelenting flint to drops of rain 


lavinia

when did the tiger young ones teach the dam 
o  do not learn her wrath  she taught it thee 
the milk thou suck from her did turn to marble 
even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny 
yet every mother breeds not sons alike 
to chiron
do thou entreat her show a woman pity 


chiron

what  wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard 


lavinia

 true  the raven doth not hatch a lark 
yet have i heard o  could i find it now 
the lion moved with pity did endure
to have his princely paws pared all away 
some say that ravens foster forlorn children 
the whilst their own birds famish in their nests 
o  be to me  though thy hard heart say no 
nothing so kind  but something pitiful 


tamora

i know not what it means  away with her 


lavinia

o  let me teach thee  for my father sake 
that gave thee life  when well he might have
slain thee 
be not obdurate  open thy deaf ears 


tamora

hadst thou in person ne offended me 
even for his sake am i pitiless 
remember  boys  i pour forth tears in vain 
to save your brother from the sacrifice 
but fierce andronicus would not relent 
therefore  away with her  and use her as you will 
the worse to her  the better loved of me 


lavinia

o tamora  be call a gentle queen 
and with thine own hands kill me in this place 
for  not life that i have begg so long 
poor i was slain when bassianus died 


tamora

what begg thou  then  fond woman  let me go 


lavinia

 present death i beg  and one thing more
that womanhood denies my tongue to tell 
o  keep me from their worse than killing lust 
and tumble me into some loathsome pit 
where never man eye may behold my body 
do this  and be a charitable murderer 


tamora

so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee 
no  let them satisfy their lust on thee 


demetrius

away  for thou hast stay us here too long 


lavinia

no grace  no womanhood  ah  beastly creature 
the blot and enemy to our general name 
confusion fall 


chiron

nay  then i stop your mouth  bring thou her husband 
this is the hole where aaron bid us hide him 
demetrius throws the body of bassianus into the  pit  then exeunt demetrius and chiron  dragging off lavinia


tamora

farewell  my sons  see that you make her sure 
ne let my heart know merry cheer indeed 
till all the andronici be made away 
now will i hence to seek my lovely moor 
and let my spleenful sons this trull deflow r 
exit
re enter aaron  with quintus and martius


aaron

come on  my lords  the better foot before 
straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit
where i espied the panther fast asleep 


quintus

my sight is very dull  whate it bodes 


martius

and mine  i promise you  were not for shame 
well could i leave our sport to sleep awhile 
falls into the pit


quintus

what art thou fall n  what subtle hole is this 
whose mouth is cover with rude growing briers 
upon whose leaves are drops of new shed blood
as fresh as morning dew distill on flowers 
a very fatal place it seems to me 
speak  brother  hast thou hurt thee with the fall 


martius

o brother  with the dismall object hurt
that ever eye with sight made heart lament 


aaron

 aside   now will i fetch the king to find them here 
that he thereby may give a likely guess
how these were they that made away his brother 
exit


martius

why dost not comfort me  and help me out
from this unhallowed and blood stained hole 


quintus

i am surprised with an uncouth fear 
a chilling sweat o er runs my trembling joints 
my heart suspects more than mine eye can see 


martius

to prove thou hast a true divining heart 
aaron and thou look down into this den 
and see a fearful sight of blood and death 


quintus

aaron is gone  and my compassionate heart
will not permit mine eyes once to behold
the thing whereat it trembles by surmise 
o  tell me how it is  for ne till now
was i a child to fear i know not what 


martius

lord bassianus lies embrewed here 
all on a heap  like to a slaughter lamb 
in this detested  dark  blood drinking pit 


quintus

if it be dark  how dost thou know  he 


martius

upon his bloody finger he doth wear
a precious ring  that lightens all the hole 
which  like a taper in some monument 
doth shine upon the dead man earthy cheeks 
and shows the ragged entrails of the pit 
so pale did shine the moon on pyramus
when he by night lay bathed in maiden blood 
o brother  help me with thy fainting hand 
if fear hath made thee faint  as me it hath 
out of this fell devouring receptacle 
as hateful as cocytus  misty mouth 


quintus

reach me thy hand  that i may help thee out 
or  wanting strength to do thee so much good 
i may be pluck into the swallowing womb
of this deep pit  poor bassianus  grave 
i have no strength to pluck thee to the brink 


martius

nor i no strength to climb without thy help 


quintus

thy hand once more  i will not loose again 
till thou art here aloft  or i below 
thou canst not come to me  i come to thee 
falls in
enter saturninus with aaron


saturninus

along with me  i see what hole is here 
and what he is that now is leap into it 
say who art thou that lately didst descend
into this gaping hollow of the earth 


martius

the unhappy son of old andronicus 
brought hither in a most unlucky hour 
to find thy brother bassianus dead 


saturninus

my brother dead  i know thou dost but jest 
he and his lady both are at the lodge
upon the north side of this pleasant chase 
 not an hour since i left him there 


martius

we know not where you left him all alive 
but  out  alas  here have we found him dead 
re enter tamora  with attendants  titus andronicus  and lucius


tamora

where is my lord the king 


saturninus

here  tamora  though grieved with killing grief 


tamora

where is thy brother bassianus 


saturninus

now to the bottom dost thou search my wound 
poor bassianus here lies murdered 


tamora

then all too late i bring this fatal writ 
the complot of this timeless tragedy 
and wonder greatly that man face can fold
in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny 
she giveth saturninus a letter


saturninus

 reads    if we miss to meet him handsomely 
sweet huntsman  bassianus  we mean 
do thou so much as dig the grave for him 
thou know our meaning  look for thy reward
among the nettles at the elder tree
which overshades the mouth of that same pit
where we decreed to bury bassianus 
do this  and purchase us thy lasting friends 
o tamora  was ever heard the like 
this is the pit  and this the elder tree 
look  sirs  if you can find the huntsman out
that should have murdered bassianus here 


aaron

my gracious lord  here is the bag of gold 


saturninus

 to titus   two of thy whelps  fell curs of
bloody kind 
have here bereft my brother of his life 
sirs  drag them from the pit unto the prison 
there let them bide until we have devised
some never heard of torturing pain for them 


tamora

what  are they in this pit  o wondrous thing 
how easily murder is discovered 


titus andronicus

high emperor  upon my feeble knee
i beg this boon  with tears not lightly shed 
that this fell fault of my accursed sons 
accursed if the fault be proved in them 


saturninus

if it be proved  you see it is apparent 
who found this letter  tamora  was it you 


tamora

andronicus himself did take it up 


titus andronicus

i did  my lord  yet let me be their bail 
for  by my father reverend tomb  i vow
they shall be ready at your highness  will
to answer their suspicion with their lives 


saturninus

thou shalt not bail them  see thou follow me 
some bring the murder body  some the murderers 
let them not speak a word  the guilt is plain 
for  by my soul  were there worse end than death 
that end upon them should be executed 


tamora

andronicus  i will entreat the king 
fear not thy sons  they shall do well enough 


titus andronicus

come  lucius  come  stay not to talk with them 
exeunt
