if thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord 
exeunt demetrius and chiron
enter marcus


marcus

who is this  my niece  that flies away so fast 
cousin  a word  where is your husband 
if i do dream  would all my wealth would wake me 
if i do wake  some planet strike me down 
that i may slumber in eternal sleep 
speak  gentle niece  what stern ungentle hands
have lopp and hew and made thy body bare
of her two branches  those sweet ornaments 
whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in 
and might not gain so great a happiness
as have thy love  why dost not speak to me 
alas  a crimson river of warm blood 
like to a bubbling fountain stirr with wind 
doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips 
coming and going with thy honey breath 
but  sure  some tereus hath deflowered thee 
and  lest thou shouldst detect him  cut thy tongue 
ah  now thou turn away thy face for shame 
and  notwithstanding all this loss of blood 
as from a conduit with three issuing spouts 
yet do thy cheeks look red as titan face
blushing to be encountered with a cloud 
shall i speak for thee  shall i say  so 
o  that i knew thy heart  and knew the beast 
that i might rail at him  to ease my mind 
sorrow concealed  like an oven stopp d 
doth burn the heart to cinders where it is 
fair philomela  she but lost her tongue 
and in a tedious sampler sew her mind 
but  lovely niece  that mean is cut from thee 
a craftier tereus  cousin  hast thou met 
and he hath cut those pretty fingers off 
that could have better sew than philomel 
o  had the monster seen those lily hands
tremble  like aspen leaves  upon a lute 
and make the silken strings delight to kiss them 
he would not then have touch them for his life 
or  had he heard the heavenly harmony
which that sweet tongue hath made 
he would have dropp his knife  and fell asleep
as cerberus at the thracian poet feet 
come  let us go  and make thy father blind 
for such a sight will blind a father eye 
one hour storm will drown the fragrant meads 
what will whole months of tears thy father eyes 
do not draw back  for we will mourn with thee
o  could our mourning ease thy misery 
exeunt
