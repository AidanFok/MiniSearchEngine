scene ii  a room in titus house  a banquet set out 


enter titus  marcus  lavinia and young lucius  a boy


titus andronicus

so  so  now sit  and look you eat no more
than will preserve just so much strength in us
as will revenge these bitter woes of ours 
marcus  unknit that sorrow wreathen knot 
thy niece and i  poor creatures  want our hands 
and cannot passionate our tenfold grief
with folded arms  this poor right hand of mine
is left to tyrannize upon my breast 
who  when my heart  all mad with misery 
beats in this hollow prison of my flesh 
then thus i thump it down 
to lavinia
thou map of woe  that thus dost talk in signs 
when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating 
thou canst not strike it thus to make it still 
wound it with sighing  girl  kill it with groans 
or get some little knife between thy teeth 
and just against thy heart make thou a hole 
that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
may run into that sink  and soaking in
drown the lamenting fool in sea salt tears 


marcus andronicus

fie  brother  fie  teach her not thus to lay
such violent hands upon her tender life 


titus andronicus

how now  has sorrow made thee dote already 
why  marcus  no man should be mad but i 
what violent hands can she lay on her life 
ah  wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands 
to bid aeneas tell the tale twice o er 
how troy was burnt and he made miserable 
o  handle not the theme  to talk of hands 
lest we remember still that we have none 
fie  fie  how franticly i square my talk 
as if we should forget we had no hands 
if marcus did not name the word of hands 
come  let fall to  and  gentle girl  eat this 
here is no drink  hark  marcus  what she says 
i can interpret all her martyr signs 
she says she drinks no other drink but tears 
brew with her sorrow  mesh upon her cheeks 
speechless complainer  i will learn thy thought 
in thy dumb action will i be as perfect
as begging hermits in their holy prayers 
thou shalt not sigh  nor hold thy stumps to heaven 
nor wink  nor nod  nor kneel  nor make a sign 
but i of these will wrest an alphabet
and by still practise learn to know thy meaning 


young lucius

good grandsire  leave these bitter deep laments 
make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale 


marcus andronicus

alas  the tender boy  in passion moved 
doth weep to see his grandsire heaviness 


titus andronicus

peace  tender sapling  thou art made of tears 
and tears will quickly melt thy life away 
marcus strikes the dish with a knife
what dost thou strike at  marcus  with thy knife 


marcus andronicus

at that that i have kill d  my lord  a fly 


titus andronicus

out on thee  murderer  thou kill my heart 
mine eyes are cloy with view of tyranny 
a deed of death done on the innocent
becomes not titus  brother  get thee gone 
i see thou art not for my company 


marcus andronicus

alas  my lord  i have but kill a fly 


titus andronicus

but how  if that fly had a father and mother 
how would he hang his slender gilded wings 
and buzz lamenting doings in the air 
poor harmless fly 
that  with his pretty buzzing melody 
came here to make us merry  and thou hast
kill him 


marcus andronicus

pardon me  sir  it was a black ill favor fly 
like to the empress  moor  therefore i kill him 


titus andronicus

o  o  o 
then pardon me for reprehending thee 
for thou hast done a charitable deed 
give me thy knife  i will insult on him 
flattering myself  as if it were the moor
come hither purposely to poison me 
there for thyself  and that for tamora 
ah  sirrah 
yet  i think  we are not brought so low 
but that between us we can kill a fly
that comes in likeness of a coal black moor 


marcus andronicus

alas  poor man  grief has so wrought on him 
he takes false shadows for true substances 


titus andronicus

come  take away  lavinia  go with me 
i to thy closet  and go read with thee
sad stories chanced in the times of old 
come  boy  and go with me  thy sight is young 
and thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle
