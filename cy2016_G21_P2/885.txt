young lucius

help  grandsire  help  my aunt lavinia
follows me every where  i know not why 
good uncle marcus  see how swift she comes 
alas  sweet aunt  i know not what you mean 


marcus andronicus

stand by me  lucius  do not fear thine aunt 


titus andronicus

she loves thee  boy  too well to do thee harm 


young lucius

marcus andronicus

what means my niece lavinia by these signs 


titus andronicus

fear her not  lucius  somewhat doth she mean 
see  lucius  see how much she makes of thee 
somewhither would she have thee go with her 
ah  boy  cornelia never with more care
read to her sons than she hath read to thee
sweet poetry and tully orator 


marcus andronicus

canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus 


young lucius

my lord  i know not  i  nor can i guess 
unless some fit or frenzy do possess her 
for i have heard my grandsire say full oft 
extremity of griefs would make men mad 
and i have read that hecuba of troy
ran mad through sorrow  that made me to fear 
although  my lord  i know my noble aunt
loves me as dear as e my mother did 
and would not  but in fury  fright my youth 
which made me down to throw my books  and fly 
causeless  perhaps  but pardon me  sweet aunt 
and  madam  if my uncle marcus go 
i will most willingly attend your ladyship 


marcus andronicus

lucius  i will 
lavinia turns over with her stumps the books which lucius has let fall


titus andronicus

how now  lavinia  marcus  what means this 
some book there is that she desires to see 
which is it  girl  of these  open them  boy 
but thou art deeper read  and better skill 
come  and take choice of all my library 
and so beguile thy sorrow  till the heavens
reveal the damn contriver of this deed 
why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus 


marcus andronicus

i think she means that there was more than one
confederate in the fact  ay  more there was 
or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge 


titus andronicus

lucius  what book is that she tosseth so 


young lucius

grandsire   ovid metamorphoses 
my mother gave it me 


marcus andronicus

for love of her that gone 
perhaps she cull it from among the rest 


titus andronicus

soft  see how busily she turns the leaves 
helping her
what would she find  lavinia  shall i read 
this is the tragic tale of philomel 
and treats of tereus  treason and his rape 
and rape  i fear  was root of thine annoy 


marcus andronicus

see  brother  see  note how she quotes the leaves 


titus andronicus

lavinia  wert thou thus surprised  sweet girl 
ravish and wrong d  as philomela was 
forced in the ruthless  vast  and gloomy woods  see  see 
ay  such a place there is  where we did hunt 
o  had we never  never hunted there 
pattern by that the poet here describes 
by nature made for murders and for rapes 


marcus andronicus

o  why should nature build so foul a den 
unless the gods delight in tragedies 


titus andronicus

give signs  sweet girl  for here are none
but friends 
what roman lord it was durst do the deed 
or slunk not saturnine  as tarquin erst 
that left the camp to sin in lucrece  bed 


marcus andronicus

sit down  sweet niece  brother  sit down by me 
apollo  pallas  jove  or mercury 
inspire me  that i may this treason find 
my lord  look here  look here  lavinia 
this sandy plot is plain  guide  if thou canst
this after me  when i have writ my name
without the help of any hand at all 
he writes his name with his staff  and guides it with feet and mouth
cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift 
write thou good niece  and here display  at last 
what god will have discover for revenge 
heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain 
that we may know the traitors and the truth 
she takes the staff in her mouth  and guides it with her stumps  and writes


titus andronicus

o  do ye read  my lord  what she hath writ 
 stuprum  chiron  demetrius 


marcus andronicus

what  what  the lustful sons of tamora
performers of this heinous  bloody deed 


titus andronicus

magni dominator poli 
tam lentus audis scelera  tam lentus vides 


marcus andronicus

o  calm thee  gentle lord  although i know
there is enough written upon this earth
to stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
and arm the minds of infants to exclaims 
my lord  kneel down with me  lavinia  kneel 
and kneel  sweet boy  the roman hector hope 
and swear with me  as  with the woful fere
and father of that chaste dishonour dame 
lord junius brutus sware for lucrece  rape 
that we will prosecute by good advice
mortal revenge upon these traitorous goths 
and see their blood  or die with this reproach 


titus andronicus

 sure enough  an you knew how 
but if you hunt these bear whelps  then beware 
the dam will wake  and  if she wind you once 
she with the lion deeply still in league 
and lulls him whilst she playeth on her back 
and when he sleeps will she do what she list 
you are a young huntsman  marcus  let it alone 
and  come  i will go get a leaf of brass 
and with a gad of steel will write these words 
and lay it by  the angry northern wind
will blow these sands  like sibyl leaves  abroad 
and where your lesson  then  boy  what say you 


young lucius

i say  my lord  that if i were a man 
their mother bed chamber should not be safe
for these bad bondmen to the yoke of rome 


marcus andronicus

ay  that my boy  thy father hath full oft
for his ungrateful country done the like 


young lucius

and  uncle  so will i  an if i live 


titus andronicus

come  go with me into mine armoury 
lucius  i fit thee  and withal  my boy 
shalt carry from me to the empress  sons
presents that i intend to send them both 
come  come  thou do thy message  wilt thou not 


young lucius

ay  with my dagger in their bosoms  grandsire 


titus andronicus

no  boy  not so  i teach thee another course 
lavinia  come  marcus  look to my house 
lucius and i go brave it at the court 
ay  marry  will we  sir  and we be waited on 
exeunt titus  lavinia  and young lucius


marcus andronicus

o heavens  can you hear a good man groan 
and not relent  or not compassion him 
marcus  attend him in his ecstasy 
that hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
than foemen marks upon his batter shield 
but yet so just that he will not revenge 
revenge  ye heavens  for old andronicus 
exit
