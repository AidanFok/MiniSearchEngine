scene ii  the same  a room in the palace 


enter  from one side  aaron  demetrius  and  chiron  from the other side  young lucius  and an  attendant  with a bundle of weapons  and verses writ upon them


chiron

demetrius  here the son of lucius 
he hath some message to deliver us 


aaron

ay  some mad message from his mad grandfather 


young lucius

my lords  with all the humbleness i may 
i greet your honours from andronicus 
aside
and pray the roman gods confound you both 


demetrius

gramercy  lovely lucius  what the news 


young lucius

 aside   that you are both decipher d  that the news 
for villains mark with rape may it please you 
my grandsire  well advised  hath sent by me
the goodliest weapons of his armoury
to gratify your honourable youth 
the hope of rome  for so he bade me say 
and so i do  and with his gifts present
your lordships  that  whenever you have need 
you may be armed and appointed well 
and so i leave you both 
aside
like bloody villains 
exeunt young lucius  and attendant


demetrius

what here  a scroll  and written round about 
let see 
reads
 vitae  scelerisque purus 
non eget mauri jaculis  nec arcu 


chiron

o   a verse in horace  i know it well 
i read it in the grammar long ago 


aaron

ay  just  a verse in horace  right  you have it 
aside
now  what a thing it is to be an ass 
here no sound jest  the old man hath found their guilt 
and sends them weapons wrapped about with lines 
that wound  beyond their feeling  to the quick 
but were our witty empress well afoot 
she would applaud andronicus  conceit 
but let her rest in her unrest awhile 
and now  young lords  was not a happy star
led us to rome  strangers  and more than so 
captives  to be advanced to this height 
it did me good  before the palace gate
to brave the tribune in his brother hearing 


demetrius

but me more good  to see so great a lord
basely insinuate and send us gifts 


aaron

had he not reason  lord demetrius 
did you not use his daughter very friendly 


demetrius

i would we had a thousand roman dames
at such a bay  by turn to serve our lust 


chiron

a charitable wish and full of love 


aaron

here lacks but your mother for to say amen 


chiron

and that would she for twenty thousand more 


demetrius

come  let us go  and pray to all the gods
for our beloved mother in her pains 


aaron

 aside   pray to the devils  the gods have given us over 
trumpets sound within


demetrius

why do the emperor trumpets flourish thus 


chiron

belike  for joy the emperor hath a son 


demetrius

soft  who comes here 
enter a nurse  with a blackamoor child in her arms


nurse

good morr ow  lords 
o  tell me  did you see aaron the moor 


aaron

well  more or less  or ne a whit at all 
here aaron is  and what with aaron now 


nurse

o gentle aaron  we are all undone 
now help  or woe betide thee evermore 


aaron

why  what a caterwauling dost thou keep 
what dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms 


nurse

o  that which i would hide from heaven eye 
our empress  shame  and stately rome disgrace 
she is deliver d  lords  she is deliver d 


aaron

to whom 


nurse

       i mean  she is brought a bed 


aaron

well  god give her good rest  what hath he sent her 


nurse

a devil 


aaron

why  then she is the devil dam  a joyful issue 


nurse

a joyless  dismal  black  and sorrowful issue 
here is the babe  as loathsome as a toad
amongst the fairest breeders of our clime 
the empress sends it thee  thy stamp  thy seal 
and bids thee christen it with thy dagger point 


aaron

 zounds  ye whore  is black so base a hue 
sweet blowse  you are a beauteous blossom  sure 


demetrius

villain  what hast thou done 


aaron

that which thou canst not undo 


chiron

thou hast undone our mother 


aaron

villain  i have done thy mother 


demetrius

and therein  hellish dog  thou hast undone 
woe to her chance  and damn her loathed choice 
accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend 


chiron

it shall not live 


aaron

it shall not die 


nurse

aaron  it must  the mother wills it so 


aaron

what  must it  nurse  then let no man but i
do execution on my flesh and blood 


demetrius

i broach the tadpole on my rapier point 
nurse  give it me  my sword shall soon dispatch it 


aaron

sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up 
takes the child from the nurse  and draws
stay  murderous villains  will you kill your brother 
now  by the burning tapers of the sky 
that shone so brightly when this boy was got 
he dies upon my scimitar sharp point
that touches this my first born son and heir 
i tell you  younglings  not enceladus 
with all his threatening band of typhon brood 
nor great alcides  nor the god of war 
shall seize this prey out of his father hands 
what  what  ye sanguine  shallow hearted boys 
ye white limed walls  ye alehouse painted signs 
coal black is better than another hue 
in that it scorns to bear another hue 
for all the water in the ocean
can never turn the swan black legs to white 
although she lave them hourly in the flood 
tell the empress from me  i am of age
to keep mine own  excuse it how she can 


demetrius

wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus 


aaron

my mistress is my mistress  this myself 
the vigour and the picture of my youth 
this before all the world do i prefer 
this maugre all the world will i keep safe 
or some of you shall smoke for it in rome 


demetrius

by this our mother is forever shamed 


chiron

rome will despise her for this foul escape 


nurse

the emperor  in his rage  will doom her death 


chiron

i blush to think upon this ignomy 


aaron

why  there the privilege your beauty bears 
fie  treacherous hue  that will betray with blushing
the close enacts and counsels of the heart 
here a young lad framed of another leer 
look  how the black slave smiles upon the father 
as who should say  lad  i am thine own 
he is your brother  lords  sensibly fed
of that self blood that first gave life to you 
and from that womb where you imprison were
he is enfranchised and come to light 
nay  he is your brother by the surer side 
although my seal be stamped in his face 


nurse

aaron  what shall i say unto the empress 


demetrius

advise thee  aaron  what is to be done 
and we will all subscribe to thy advice 
save thou the child  so we may all be safe 


aaron

then sit we down  and let us all consult 
my son and i will have the wind of you 
keep there  now talk at pleasure of your safety 
they sit


demetrius

how many women saw this child of his 


aaron

why  so  brave lords  when we join in league 
i am a lamb  but if you brave the moor 
the chafed boar  the mountain lioness 
the ocean swells not so as aaron storms 
but say  again  how many saw the child 


nurse

cornelia the midwife and myself 
and no one else but the deliver empress 


aaron

the empress  the midwife  and yourself 
two may keep counsel when the third away 
go to the empress  tell her this i said 
he kills the nurse
weke  weke  so cries a pig prepared to the spit 


demetrius

what mean thou  aaron  wherefore didst thou this 


aaron

o lord  sir   a deed of policy 
shall she live to betray this guilt of ours 
a long tongued babbling gossip  no  lords  no 
and now be it known to you my full intent 
not far  one muli lives  my countryman 
his wife but yesternight was brought to bed 
his child is like to her  fair as you are 
go pack with him  and give the mother gold 
and tell them both the circumstance of all 
and how by this their child shall be advanced 
and be received for the emperor heir 
and substituted in the place of mine 
to calm this tempest whirling in the court 
and let the emperor dandle him for his own 
hark ye  lords  ye see i have given her physic 
pointing to the nurse
and you must needs bestow her funeral 
the fields are near  and you are gallant grooms 
this done  see that you take no longer days 
but send the midwife presently to me 
the midwife and the nurse well made away 
then let the ladies tattle what they please 


chiron

aaron  i see thou wilt not trust the air
with secrets 


demetrius

                  for this care of tamora 
herself and hers are highly bound to thee 
exeunt demetrius and chiron bearing off the nurse body


aaron

now to the goths  as swift as swallow flies 
there to dispose this treasure in mine arms 
and secretly to greet the empress  friends 
come on  you thick lipp slave  i bear you hence 
for it is you that puts us to our shifts 
i make you feed on berries and on roots 
and feed on curds and whey  and suck the goat 
and cabin in a cave  and bring you up
to be a warrior  and command a camp 
exit
