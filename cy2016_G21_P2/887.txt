scene iii  the same  a public place 


enter titus  bearing arrows with letters at the  ends of them  with him  marcus  young lucius   publius  sempronius  caius  and other gentlemen  with bows


titus andronicus

come  marcus  come  kinsmen  this is the way 
sir boy  now let me see your archery 
look ye draw home enough  and  there straight 
terras astraea reliquit 
be you remember d  marcus  she gone  she fled 
sirs  take you to your tools  you  cousins  shall
go sound the ocean  and cast your nets 
happily you may catch her in the sea 
yet there as little justice as at land 
no  publius and sempronius  you must do it 
 you must dig with mattock and with spade 
and pierce the inmost centre of the earth 
then  when you come to pluto region 
i pray you  deliver him this petition 
tell him  it is for justice and for aid 
and that it comes from old andronicus 
shaken with sorrows in ungrateful rome 
ah  rome  well  well  i made thee miserable
what time i threw the people suffrages
on him that thus doth tyrannize o me 
go  get you gone  and pray be careful all 
and leave you not a man of war unsearch d 
this wicked emperor may have shipp her hence 
and  kinsmen  then we may go pipe for justice 


marcus andronicus

o publius  is not this a heavy case 
to see thy noble uncle thus distract 


publius

therefore  my lord  it highly us concerns
by day and night to attend him carefully 
and feed his humour kindly as we may 
till time beget some careful remedy 


marcus andronicus

kinsmen  his sorrows are past remedy 
join with the goths  and with revengeful war
take wreak on rome for this ingratitude 
and vengeance on the traitor saturnine 


titus andronicus

publius  how now  how now  my masters 
what  have you met with her 


publius

no  my good lord  but pluto sends you word 
if you will have revenge from hell  you shall 
marry  for justice  she is so employ d 
he thinks  with jove in heaven  or somewhere else 
so that perforce you must needs stay a time 


titus andronicus

he doth me wrong to feed me with delays 
i dive into the burning lake below 
and pull her out of acheron by the heels 
marcus  we are but shrubs  no cedars we
no big boned men framed of the cyclops  size 
but metal  marcus  steel to the very back 
yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear 
and  sith there no justice in earth nor hell 
we will solicit heaven and move the gods
to send down justice for to wreak our wrongs 
come  to this gear  you are a good archer  marcus 
he gives them the arrows
 jovem  that for you  here   apollinem 
 martem  that for myself 
here  boy  to pallas  here  to mercury 
to saturn  caius  not to saturnine 
you were as good to shoot against the wind 
to it  boy  marcus  loose when i bid 
of my word  i have written to effect 
there not a god left unsolicited 


marcus andronicus

kinsmen  shoot all your shafts into the court 
we will afflict the emperor in his pride 


titus andronicus

now  masters  draw 
they shoot
o  well said  lucius 
good boy  in virgo lap  give it pallas 


marcus andronicus

my lord  i aim a mile beyond the moon 
your letter is with jupiter by this 


titus andronicus

ha  ha 
publius  publius  what hast thou done 
see  see  thou hast shot off one of taurus  horns 


marcus andronicus

this was the sport  my lord  when publius shot 
the bull  being gall d  gave aries such a knock
that down fell both the ram horns in the court 
and who should find them but the empress  villain 
she laugh d  and told the moor he should not choose
but give them to his master for a present 


titus andronicus

why  there it goes  god give his lordship joy 
enter a clown  with a basket  and two pigeons in it
news  news from heaven  marcus  the post is come 
sirrah  what tidings  have you any letters 
shall i have justice  what says jupiter

them down again  for the man must not be hanged till

forbid i should be so bold to press to heaven in my
young days  why  i am going with my pigeons to the
tribunal plebs  to take up a matter of brawl
betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial men 


marcus andronicus

why  sir  that is as fit as can be to serve for
your oration  and let him deliver the pigeons to
the emperor from you 


titus andronicus

tell me  can you deliver an oration to the emperor
with a grace 


clown

but give your pigeons to the emperor 
by me thou shalt have justice at his hands 
hold  hold  meanwhile here money for thy charges 
give me pen and ink  sirrah  can you with a grace
deliver a supplication 


clown

titus andronicus

come to him  at the first approach you must kneel 
then kiss his foot  then deliver up your pigeons  and
then look for your reward  i be at hand  sir  see

here  marcus  fold it in the oration 
for thou hast made it like an humble suppliant 
and when thou hast given it the emperor 
knock at my door  and tell me what he says
