scene iv  the same  before the palace 


enter saturninus  tamora  demetrius  chiron   lords  and others  saturninus with the arrows in his hand that titus shot


saturninus

why  lords  what wrongs are these  was ever seen
an emperor in rome thus overborne 
troubled  confronted thus  and  for the extent
of egal justice  used in such contempt 
my lords  you know  as know the mightful gods 
however these disturbers of our peace
buz in the people ears  there nought hath pass d 
but even with law  against the willful sons
of old andronicus  and what an if
his sorrows have so overwhelm his wits 
shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks 
his fits  his frenzy  and his bitterness 
and now he writes to heaven for his redress 
see  here to jove  and this to mercury 
this to apollo  this to the god of war 
sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of rome 
what this but libelling against the senate 
and blazoning our injustice every where 
a goodly humour  is it not  my lords 
as who would say  in rome no justice were 
but if i live  his feigned ecstasies
shall be no shelter to these outrages 
but he and his shall know that justice lives
in saturninus  health  whom  if she sleep 
he so awake as she in fury shall
cut off the proud conspirator that lives 


tamora

my gracious lord  my lovely saturnine 
lord of my life  commander of my thoughts 
calm thee  and bear the faults of titus  age 
the effects of sorrow for his valiant sons 
whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr his heart 
and rather comfort his distressed plight
than prosecute the meanest or the best
for these contempts 
aside
why  thus it shall become
high witted tamora to gloze with all 
but  titus  i have touched thee to the quick 
thy life blood out  if aaron now be wise 
then is all safe  the anchor in the port 
enter clown
how now  good fellow  wouldst thou speak with us 


clown

yea  forsooth  an your mistership be emperial 


tamora

empress i am  but yonder sits the emperor 


clown

 he  god and saint stephen give you good den 
i have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here 
saturninus reads the letter


saturninus

go  take him away  and hang him presently 


clown

how much money must i have 


tamora

come  sirrah  you must be hanged 


clown

hanged  by lady  then i have brought up a neck to
a fair end 
exit  guarded


saturninus

despiteful and intolerable wrongs 
shall i endure this monstrous villany 
i know from whence this same device proceeds 
may this be borne as if his traitorous sons 
that died by law for murder of our brother 
have by my means been butcher wrongfully 
go  drag the villain hither by the hair 
nor age nor honour shall shape privilege 
for this proud mock i be thy slaughterman 
sly frantic wretch  that holp to make me great 
in hope thyself should govern rome and me 
enter aemilius
what news with thee  aemilius 


aemilius

arm  arm  my lord rome never had more cause 
the goths have gather head  and with a power
high resolved men  bent to the spoil 
they hither march amain  under conduct
of lucius  son to old andronicus 
who threats  in course of this revenge  to do
as much as ever coriolanus did 


saturninus

is warlike lucius general of the goths 
these tidings nip me  and i hang the head
as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms 
ay  now begin our sorrows to approach 
 he the common people love so much 
myself hath often over heard them say 
when i have walked like a private man 
that lucius  banishment was wrongfully 
and they have wish that lucius were their emperor 


tamora

why should you fear  is not your city strong 


saturninus

ay  but the citizens favor lucius 
and will revolt from me to succor him 


tamora

king  be thy thoughts imperious  like thy name 
is the sun dimm d  that gnats do fly in it 
the eagle suffers little birds to sing 
and is not careful what they mean thereby 
knowing that with the shadow of his wings
he can at pleasure stint their melody 
even so mayst thou the giddy men of rome 
then cheer thy spirit   for know  thou emperor 
i will enchant the old andronicus
with words more sweet  and yet more dangerous 
than baits to fish  or honey stalks to sheep 
when as the one is wounded with the bait 
the other rotted with delicious feed 


saturninus

but he will not entreat his son for us 


tamora

if tamora entreat him  then he will 
for i can smooth and fill his aged ear
with golden promises  that  were his heart
almost impregnable  his old ears deaf 
yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue 
to aemilius
go thou before  be our ambassador 
say that the emperor requests a parley
of warlike lucius  and appoint the meeting
even at his father house  the old andronicus 


saturninus

aemilius  do this message honourably 
and if he stand on hostage for his safety 
bid him demand what pledge will please him best 


aemilius

your bidding shall i do effectually 
exit


tamora

now will i to that old andronicus 
and temper him with all the art i have 
to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths 
and now  sweet emperor  be blithe again 
and bury all thy fear in my devices 


saturninus

then go successantly  and plead to him 
exeunt
