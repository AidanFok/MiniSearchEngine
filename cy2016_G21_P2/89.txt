scene i  london  the parliament house 


alarum  enter york  edward  richard  norfolk  montague  warwick  and soldiers


warwick

i wonder how the king escaped our hands 


york

while we pursued the horsemen of the north 
he slily stole away and left his men 
whereat the great lord of northumberland 
whose warlike ears could never brook retreat 
cheer up the drooping army  and himself 
lord clifford and lord stafford  all abreast 
charged our main battle front  and breaking in
were by the swords of common soldiers slain 


edward

lord stafford father  duke of buckingham 
is either slain or wounded dangerously 
i cleft his beaver with a downright blow 
that this is true  father  behold his blood 


montague

and  brother  here the earl of wiltshire blood 
whom i encounter as the battles join d 


richard

speak thou for me and tell them what i did 
throwing down somerset head


york

richard hath best deserved of all my sons 
but is your grace dead  my lord of somerset 


norfolk

such hope have all the line of john of gaunt 


richard

thus do i hope to shake king henry head 


warwick

and so do i  victorious prince of york 
before i see thee seated in that throne
which now the house of lancaster usurps 
i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close 
this is the palace of the fearful king 
and this the regal seat  possess it  york 
for this is thine and not king henry heirs 


york

assist me  then  sweet warwick  and i will 
for hither we have broken in by force 


norfolk

we all assist you  he that flies shall die 


york

thanks  gentle norfolk  stay by me  my lords 
and  soldiers  stay and lodge by me this night 
they go up


warwick

and when the king comes  offer no violence 
unless he seek to thrust you out perforce 


york

the queen this day here holds her parliament 
but little thinks we shall be of her council 
by words or blows here let us win our right 


richard

arm as we are  let stay within this house 


warwick

the bloody parliament shall this be call d 
unless plantagenet  duke of york  be king 
and bashful henry deposed  whose cowardice
hath made us by words to our enemies 


york

then leave me not  my lords  be resolute 
i mean to take possession of my right 


warwick

neither the king  nor he that loves him best 
the proudest he that holds up lancaster 
dares stir a wing  if warwick shake his bells 
i plant plantagenet  root him up who dares 
resolve thee  richard  claim the english crown 
flourish  enter king henry vi  clifford  northumberland  westmoreland  exeter  and the rest


king henry vi

my lords  look where the sturdy rebel sits 
even in the chair of state  belike he means 
back by the power of warwick  that false peer 
to aspire unto the crown and reign as king 
earl of northumberland  he slew thy father 
and thine  lord clifford  and you both have vow revenge
on him  his sons  his favourites and his friends 


northumberland

if i be not  heavens be revenged on me 


clifford

the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel 


westmoreland

what  shall we suffer this  let pluck him down 
my heart for anger burns  i cannot brook it 


king henry vi

be patient  gentle earl of westmoreland 


clifford

patience is for poltroons  such as he 
he durst not sit there  had your father lived 
my gracious lord  here in the parliament
let us assail the family of york 


northumberland

well hast thou spoken  cousin  be it so 


king henry vi

ah  know you not the city favours them 
and they have troops of soldiers at their beck 


exeter

but when the duke is slain  they quickly fly 


king henry vi

far be the thought of this from henry heart 
to make a shambles of the parliament house 
cousin of exeter  frowns  words and threats
shall be the war that henry means to use 
thou factious duke of york  descend my throne 
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet 
i am thy sovereign 


york

i am thine 


exeter

for shame  come down  he made thee duke of york 


york

 my inheritance  as the earldom was 


exeter

thy father was a traitor to the crown 


warwick

exeter  thou art a traitor to the crown
in following this usurping henry 


clifford

whom should he follow but his natural king 


warwick

true  clifford  and that richard duke of york 


king henry vi

and shall i stand  and thou sit in my throne 


york

it must and shall be so  content thyself 


warwick

be duke of lancaster  let him be king 


westmoreland

he is both king and duke of lancaster 
and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain 


warwick

and warwick shall disprove it  you forget
that we are those which chased you from the field
and slew your fathers  and with colours spread
march through the city to the palace gates 


northumberland

yes  warwick  i remember it to my grief 
and  by his soul  thou and thy house shall rue it 


westmoreland

plantagenet  of thee and these thy sons 
thy kinsman and thy friends  i have more lives
than drops of blood were in my father veins 


clifford

urge it no more  lest that  instead of words 
i send thee  warwick  such a messenger
as shall revenge his death before i stir 


warwick

poor clifford  how i scorn his worthless threats 


york

will you we show our title to the crown 
if not  our swords shall plead it in the field 


king henry vi

what title hast thou  traitor  to the crown 
thy father was  as thou art  duke of york 
thy grandfather  roger mortimer  earl of march 
i am the son of henry the fifth 
who made the dauphin and the french to stoop
and seized upon their towns and provinces 


warwick

talk not of france  sith thou hast lost it all 


king henry vi

the lord protector lost it  and not i 
when i was crown i was but nine months old 


richard

you are old enough now  and yet  methinks  you lose 
father  tear the crown from the usurper head 


edward

sweet father  do so  set it on your head 


montague

good brother  as thou lovest and honourest arms 
let fight it out and not stand cavilling thus 


richard

sound drums and trumpets  and the king will fly 


york

sons  peace 


king henry vi

peace  thou  and give king henry leave to speak 


warwick

plantagenet shall speak first  hear him  lords 
and be you silent and attentive too 
for he that interrupts him shall not live 


king henry vi

think thou that i will leave my kingly throne 
wherein my grandsire and my father sat 
no  first shall war unpeople this my realm 
ay  and their colours  often borne in france 
and now in england to our heart great sorrow 
shall be my winding sheet  why faint you  lords 
my title good  and better far than his 


warwick

prove it  henry  and thou shalt be king 


king henry vi

henry the fourth by conquest got the crown 


york

 by rebellion against his king 


king henry vi

 aside   i know not what to say  my title weak 
tell me  may not a king adopt an heir 


york

what then 


king henry vi

an if he may  then am i lawful king 
for richard  in the view of many lords 
resign the crown to henry the fourth 
whose heir my father was  and i am his 


york

he rose against him  being his sovereign 
and made him to resign his crown perforce 


warwick

suppose  my lords  he did it unconstrain d 
think you  prejudicial to his crown 


exeter

no  for he could not so resign his crown
but that the next heir should succeed and reign 


king henry vi

art thou against us  duke of exeter 


exeter

his is the right  and therefore pardon me 


york

why whisper you  my lords  and answer not 


exeter

my conscience tells me he is lawful king 


king henry vi

 aside   all will revolt from me  and turn to him 


northumberland

plantagenet  for all the claim thou lay st 
think not that henry shall be so deposed 


warwick

deposed he shall be  in despite of all 


northumberland

thou art deceived   not thy southern power 
of essex  norfolk  suffolk  nor of kent 
which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud 
can set the duke up in despite of me 


clifford

king henry  be thy title right or wrong 
lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence 
may that ground gape and swallow me alive 
where i shall kneel to him that slew my father 


king henry vi

o clifford  how thy words revive my heart 


york

henry of lancaster  resign thy crown 
what mutter you  or what conspire you  lords 


warwick

do right unto this princely duke of york 
or i will fill the house with armed men 
and over the chair of state  where now he sits 
write up his title with usurping blood 
he stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves


king henry vi

my lord of warwick  hear me but one word 
let me for this my life time reign as king 


york

confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs 
and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest 


king henry vi

i am content  richard plantagenet 
enjoy the kingdom after my decease 


clifford

what wrong is this unto the prince your son 


warwick

what good is this to england and himself 


westmoreland

base  fearful and despairing henry 


clifford

how hast thou injured both thyself and us 


westmoreland

i cannot stay to hear these articles 


northumberland

nor i 


clifford

come  cousin  let us tell the queen these news 


westmoreland

farewell  faint hearted and degenerate king 
in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides 


northumberland

be thou a prey unto the house of york 
and die in bands for this unmanly deed 


clifford

in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome 
or live in peace abandon and despised 
exeunt northumberland  clifford  and westmoreland


warwick

turn this way  henry  and regard them not 


exeter

they seek revenge and therefore will not yield 


king henry vi

ah  exeter 


warwick

          why should you sigh  my lord 


king henry vi

not for myself  lord warwick  but my son 
whom i unnaturally shall disinherit 
but be it as it may  i here entail
the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever 
conditionally  that here thou take an oath
to cease this civil war  and  whilst i live 
to honour me as thy king and sovereign 
and neither by treason nor hostility
to seek to put me down and reign thyself 


york

this oath i willingly take and will perform 


warwick

long live king henry  plantagenet embrace him 


king henry vi

and long live thou and these thy forward sons 


york

now york and lancaster are reconciled 


exeter

accursed be he that seeks to make them foes 
sennet  here they come down


york

farewell  my gracious lord  i to my castle 


warwick

and i keep london with my soldiers

and i to norfolk with my followers

and i unto the sea from whence i came 
exeunt york  edward  edmund  george  richard   warwick  norfolk  montague  their soldiers  and attendants


king henry vi

and i  with grief and sorrow  to the court 
enter queen margaret and prince edward


exeter

i steal away 


king henry vi

                  exeter  so will i 


queen margaret

nay  go not from me  i will follow thee 


king henry vi

be patient  gentle queen  and i will stay 


queen margaret

who can be patient in such extremes 
ah  wretched man  would i had died a maid
and never seen thee  never borne thee son 
seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus 
hadst thou but loved him half so well as i 
or felt that pain which i did for him once 
or nourish him as i did with my blood 
thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart blood there 
rather than have that savage duke thine heir
and disinherited thine only son 


prince edward

father  you cannot disinherit me 
if you be king  why should not i succeed 


king henry vi

pardon me  margaret  pardon me  sweet son 
the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me 


queen margaret

enforced thee  art thou king  and wilt be forced 
i shame to hear thee speak  ah  timorous wretch 
thou hast undone thyself  thy son and me 
and given unto the house of york such head
as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance 
to entail him and his heirs unto the crown 
what is it  but to make thy sepulchre
and creep into it far before thy time 
warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais 
stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas 
the duke is made protector of the realm 
and yet shalt thou be safe  such safety finds
the trembling lamb environed with wolves 
had i been there  which am a silly woman 
the soldiers should have toss me on their pikes
before i would have granted to that act 
but thou preferr thy life before thine honour 
and seeing thou dost  i here divorce myself
both from thy table  henry  and thy bed 
until that act of parliament be repeal 
whereby my son is disinherited 
the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
will follow mine  if once they see them spread 
and spread they shall be  to thy foul disgrace
and utter ruin of the house of york 
thus do i leave thee  come  son  let away 
our army is ready  come  we after them 


king henry vi

stay  gentle margaret  and hear me speak 


queen margaret

thou hast spoke too much already  get thee gone 


king henry vi

gentle son edward  thou wilt stay with me 


queen margaret

ay  to be murder by his enemies 


prince edward

when i return with victory from the field
i see your grace  till then i follow her 


queen margaret

come  son  away  we may not linger thus 
exeunt queen margaret and prince edward


king henry vi

poor queen  how love to me and to her son
hath made her break out into terms of rage 
revenged may she be on that hateful duke 
whose haughty spirit  winged with desire 
will cost my crown  and like an empty eagle
tire on the flesh of me and of my son 
the loss of those three lords torments my heart 
i write unto them and entreat them fair 
come  cousin you shall be the messenger 


exeter

and i  i hope  shall reconcile them all 
exeunt
