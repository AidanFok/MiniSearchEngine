scene i  troy  before priam palace 


enter troilus armed  and pandarus


troilus

call here my varlet  i unarm again 
why should i war without the walls of troy 
that find such cruel battle here within 
each trojan that is master of his heart 
let him to field  troilus  alas  hath none 


pandarus

will this gear ne be mended 


troilus

the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength 
fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant 
but i am weaker than a woman tear 
tamer than sleep  fonder than ignorance 
less valiant than the virgin in the night
and skilless as unpractised infancy 


pandarus

well  i have told you enough of this  for my part 
i not meddle nor make no further  he that will
have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding 


troilus

have i not tarried 


pandarus

ay  the grinding  but you must tarry
the bolting 


troilus

have i not tarried 


pandarus

ay  the bolting  but you must tarry the leavening 


troilus

still have i tarried 


pandarus

ay  to the leavening  but here yet in the word
 hereafter  the kneading  the making of the cake  the
heating of the oven and the baking  nay  you must
stay the cooling too  or you may chance to burn your lips 


troilus

patience herself  what goddess e she be 
doth lesser blench at sufferance than i do 
at priam royal table do i sit 
and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts 
so  traitor   she comes  when is she thence 


pandarus

well  she looked yesternight fairer than ever i saw
her look  or any woman else 


troilus

i was about to tell thee when my heart 
as wedged with a sigh  would rive in twain 
lest hector or my father should perceive me 
i have  as when the sun doth light a storm 
buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile 
but sorrow  that is couch in seeming gladness 
is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness 


pandarus

an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen s 
well  go to there were no more comparison between
the women  but  for my part  she is my kinswoman  i
would not  as they term it  praise her  but i would
somebody had heard her talk yesterday  as i did  i
will not dispraise your sister cassandra wit  but 


troilus

o pandarus  i tell thee  pandarus 
when i do tell thee  there my hopes lie drown d 
reply not in how many fathoms deep
they lie indrench d  i tell thee i am mad
in cressid love  thou answer is fair 
pour in the open ulcer of my heart
her eyes  her hair  her cheek  her gait  her voice 
handlest in thy discourse  o  that her hand 
in whose comparison all whites are ink 
writing their own reproach  to whose soft seizure
the cygnet down is harsh and spirit of sense
hard as the palm of ploughman  this thou tell me 
as true thou tell me  when i say i love her 
but  saying thus  instead of oil and balm 
thou lay in every gash that love hath given me
the knife that made it 


pandarus

i speak no more than truth 


troilus

thou dost not speak so much 


pandarus

faith  i not meddle in t  let her be as she is 
if she be fair   the better for her  an she be
not  she has the mends in her own hands 


troilus

good pandarus  how now  pandarus 


pandarus

i have had my labour for my travail  ill thought on of
her and ill thought on of you  gone between and
between  but small thanks for my labour 


troilus

what  art thou angry  pandarus  what  with me 


pandarus

because she kin to me  therefore she not so fair
as helen  an she were not kin to me  she would be as
fair on friday as helen is on sunday  but what care
i  i care not an she were a black a moor   all one to me 


troilus

say i she is not fair 


pandarus

i do not care whether you do or no  she a fool to
stay behind her father  let her to the greeks  and so
i tell her the next time i see her  for my part 
i meddle nor make no more i  the matter 


troilus

pandarus 


pandarus

not i 


troilus

sweet pandarus 


pandarus

pray you  speak no more to me  i will leave all as i
found it  and there an end 
exit pandarus  an alarum


troilus

peace  you ungracious clamours  peace  rude sounds 
fools on both sides  helen must needs be fair 
when with your blood you daily paint her thus 
i cannot fight upon this argument 
it is too starved a subject for my sword 
but pandarus o gods  how do you plague me 
i cannot come to cressid but by pandar 
and he as tetchy to be woo to woo 
as she is stubborn chaste against all suit 
tell me  apollo  for thy daphne love 
what cressid is  what pandar  and what we 
her bed is india  there she lies  a pearl 
between our ilium and where she resides 
let it be call the wild and wandering flood 
ourself the merchant  and this sailing pandar
our doubtful hope  our convoy and our bark 
alarum  enter aeneas


aeneas

how now  prince troilus  wherefore not afield 


troilus

because not there  this woman answer sorts 
for womanish it is to be from thence 
what news  aeneas  from the field to day 


aeneas

that paris is returned home and hurt 


troilus

by whom  aeneas 


aeneas

                  troilus  by menelaus 


troilus

let paris bleed   but a scar to scorn 
paris is gored with menelaus  horn 
alarum


aeneas

hark  what good sport is out of town to day 


troilus

better at home  if  i might  were  may 
but to the sport abroad  are you bound thither 


aeneas

in all swift haste 


troilus

come  go we then together
