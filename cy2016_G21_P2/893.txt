scene ii  the same  a street 


enter cressida and alexander


cressida

who were those went by 


alexander

queen hecuba and helen 


cressida

and whither go they 


alexander

up to the eastern tower 
whose height commands as subject all the vale 
to see the battle  hector  whose patience
is  as a virtue  fix d  to day was moved 
he chid andromache and struck his armourer 
and  like as there were husbandry in war 
before the sun rose he was harness light 
and to the field goes he  where every flower
did  as a prophet  weep what it foresaw
in hector wrath 


cressida

                  what was his cause of anger 


alexander

the noise goes  this  there is among the greeks
a lord of trojan blood  nephew to hector 
they call him ajax 


cressida

good  and what of him 


alexander

they say he is a very man per se 
and stands alone 


cressida

so do all men  unless they are drunk  sick  or have no legs 


alexander

this man  lady  hath robbed many beasts of their
particular additions  he is as valiant as the lion 
churlish as the bear  slow as the elephant  a man
into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
valour is crushed into folly  his folly sauced with
discretion  there is no man hath a virtue that he
hath not a glimpse of  nor any man an attaint but he
carries some stain of it  he is melancholy without
cause  and merry against the hair  he hath the
joints of every thing  but everything so out of joint
that he is a gouty briareus  many hands and no use 
or purblind argus  all eyes and no sight 


cressida

but how should this man  that makes
me smile  make hector angry 


alexander

they say he yesterday coped hector in the battle and
struck him down  the disdain and shame whereof hath
ever since kept hector fasting and waking 


cressida

who comes here 


alexander

madam  your uncle pandarus 
enter pandarus


cressida

hector a gallant man 


alexander

as may be in the world  lady 


pandarus

what that  what that 


cressida

good morrow  uncle pandarus 


pandarus

good morrow  cousin cressid  what do you talk of 
good morrow  alexander  how do you  cousin  when
were you at ilium 


cressida

this morning  uncle 


pandarus

what were you talking of when i came  was hector
armed and gone ere ye came to ilium  helen was not
up  was she 


cressida

hector was gone  but helen was not up 


pandarus

even so  hector was stirring early 


cressida

that were we talking of  and of his anger 


pandarus

was he angry 


cressida

so he says here 


pandarus

true  he was so  i know the cause too  he lay
about him to day  i can tell them that  and there 
troilus will not come far behind him  let them take
heed of troilus  i can tell them that too 


cressida

what  is he angry too 


pandarus

who  troilus  troilus is the better man of the two 


cressida

o jupiter  there no comparison 


pandarus

what  not between troilus and hector  do you know a
man if you see him 


cressida

ay  if i ever saw him before and knew him 


pandarus

well  i say troilus is troilus 


cressida

then you say as i say  for  i am sure  he is not hector 


pandarus

no  nor hector is not troilus in some degrees 


cressida

 just to each of them  he is himself 


pandarus

himself  alas  poor troilus  i would he were 


cressida

so he is 


pandarus

condition  i had gone barefoot to india 


cressida

he is not hector 


pandarus

himself  no  he not himself  would a  were
himself  well  the gods are above  time must friend
or end  well  troilus  well  i would my heart were
in her body  no  hector is not a better man than troilus 


cressida

excuse me 


pandarus

he is elder 


cressida

pardon me  pardon me 


pandarus

th  other not come to t  you shall tell me another
tale  when th  other come to t  hector shall not
have his wit this year 


cressida

he shall not need it  if he have his own 


pandarus

nor his qualities 


cressida

no matter 


pandarus

nor his beauty 


cressida

 not become him  his own better 


pandarus

you have no judgment  niece  helen
herself swore th  other day  that troilus  for
a brown favour for so  tis  i must confess 
not brown neither 


cressida

no  but brown 


pandarus

 faith  to say truth  brown and not brown 


cressida

to say the truth  true and not true 


pandarus

she praised his complexion above paris 


cressida

why  paris hath colour enough 


pandarus

so he has 


cressida

then troilus should have too much  if she praised
him above  his complexion is higher than his  he
having colour enough  and the other higher  is too
flaming a praise for a good complexion  i had as
lief helen golden tongue had commended troilus for
a copper nose 


pandarus

i swear to you  i think helen loves him better than paris 


cressida

then she a merry greek indeed 


pandarus

nay  i am sure she does  she came to him th  other
day into the compassed window and  you know  he
has not past three or four hairs on his chin 


cressida

indeed  a tapster arithmetic may soon bring his
particulars therein to a total 


pandarus

why  he is very young  and yet will he  within
three pound  lift as much as his brother hector 


cressida

is he so young a man and so old a lifter 


pandarus

but to prove to you that helen loves him  she came
and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin 


cressida

juno have mercy  how came it cloven 


pandarus

why  you know  dimpled  i think his smiling
becomes him better than any man in all phrygia 


cressida

o  he smiles valiantly 


pandarus

does he not 


cressida

o yes  an  a cloud in autumn 


pandarus

why  go to  then  but to prove to you that helen
loves troilus 


cressida

troilus will stand to the proof  if you 
prove it so 


pandarus

troilus  why  he esteems her no more than i esteem
an addle egg 


cressida

if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
head  you would eat chickens i  the shell 


pandarus

i cannot choose but laugh  to think how she tickled
his chin  indeed  she has a marvellous white hand  i
must needs confess 


cressida

without the rack 


pandarus

and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin 


cressida

alas  poor chin  many a wart is richer 


pandarus

but there was such laughing  queen hecuba laughed
that her eyes ran o er 


cressida

with mill stones 


pandarus

and cassandra laughed 


cressida

but there was more temperate fire under the pot of
her eyes  did her eyes run o too 


pandarus

and hector laughed 


cressida

at what was all this laughing 


pandarus

marry  at the white hair that helen spied on troilus  chin 


cressida

an had been a green hair  i should have laughed
too 


pandarus

they laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer 


cressida

what was his answer 


pandarus

quoth she   here but two and fifty hairs on your
chin  and one of them is white 


cressida

this is her question 


pandarus

that true  make no question of that   and
fifty hairs  quoth he   one white  that white
hair is my father  and all the rest are his sons 
 jupiter  quoth she   of these hairs is paris 
my husband   forked one  quoth he   pluck 
out  and give it him  but there was such laughing 
and helen so blushed  an paris so chafed  and all the
rest so laughed  that it passed 


cressida

so let it now  for it has been while going by 


pandarus

well  cousin  i told you a thing yesterday  think on t 


cressida

so i do 


pandarus

i be sworn  true  he will weep you  an  
a man born in april 


cressida

and i spring up in his tears  an  a nettle
against may

and how he goes  o admirable youth  he ne saw
three and twenty  go thy way  troilus  go thy way 
had i a sister were a grace  or a daughter a goddess 
he should take his choice  o admirable man  paris 
paris is dirt to him  and  i warrant  helen  to
change  would give an eye to boot 


cressida

here come more 
forces pass


pandarus

asses  fools  dolts  chaff and bran  chaff and bran 
porridge after meat  i could live and die i  the
eyes of troilus  ne look  ne look  the eagles
are gone  crows and daws  crows and daws  i had
rather be such a man as troilus than agamemnon and
all greece 


cressida

there is among the greeks achilles  a better man than troilus 


pandarus

achilles  a drayman  a porter  a very camel 


cressida

well  well 


pandarus

 well  well  why  have you any discretion  have
you any eyes  do you know what a man is  is not
birth  beauty  good shape  discourse  manhood 
learning  gentleness  virtue  youth  liberality 
and such like  the spice and salt that season a man 


cressida

ay  a minced man  and then to be baked with no date
in the pie  for then the man date out 


pandarus

you are such a woman  one knows not at what ward you
lie 


cressida

upon my back  to defend my belly  upon my wit  to
defend my wiles  upon my secrecy  to defend mine
honesty  my mask  to defend my beauty  and you  to
defend all these  and at all these wards i lie  at a
thousand watches 


pandarus

say one of your watches 


cressida

nay  i watch you for that  and that one of the
chiefest of them too  if i cannot ward what i would
not have hit  i can watch you for telling how i took
the blow  unless it swell past hiding  and then it 
past watching 


pandarus

you are such another 
enter troilus boy


boy

sir  my lord would instantly speak with you 


pandarus

where 


boy

at your own house  there he unarms him 


pandarus

good boy  tell him i come 
exit boy
i doubt he be hurt  fare ye well  good niece 


cressida

adieu  uncle 


pandarus

i be with you  niece  by and by 


cressida

to bring  uncle 


pandarus

ay  a token from troilus 


cressida

by the same token  you are a bawd 
exit pandarus
words  vows  gifts  tears  and love full sacrifice 
he offers in another enterprise 
but more in troilus thousand fold i see
than in the glass of pandar praise may be 
yet hold i off  women are angels  wooing 
things won are done  joy soul lies in the doing 
that she beloved knows nought that knows not this 
men prize the thing ungain more than it is 
that she was never yet that ever knew
love got so sweet as when desire did sue 
therefore this maxim out of love i teach 
achievement is command  ungain d  beseech 
then though my heart content firm love doth bear 
nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear 
exeunt
