thersites

how now  thersites  what lost in the labyrinth of
thy fury  shall the elephant ajax carry it thus  he
beats me  and i rail at him  o  worthy satisfaction 
would it were otherwise  that i could beat him 
whilst he railed at me   sfoot  i learn to
conjure and raise devils  but i see some issue of
my spiteful execrations  then there achilles  a
rare enginer  if troy be not taken till these two
undermine it  the walls will stand till they fall of
themselves  o thou great thunder darter of olympus 
forget that thou art jove  the king of gods and 
mercury  lose all the serpentine craft of thy
caduceus  if ye take not that little  little less
than little wit from them that they have  which
short armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
scarce  it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
from a spider  without drawing their massy irons and
cutting the web  after this  the vengeance on the
whole camp  or rather  the bone ache  for that 
methinks  is the curse dependent on those that war
for a placket  i have said my prayers and devil envy
say amen  what ho  my lord achilles 
enter patroclus


patroclus

who there  thersites  good thersites  come in and rail 


thersites

if i could have remembered a gilt counterfeit  thou
wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation  but
it is no matter  thyself upon thyself  the common
curse of mankind  folly and ignorance  be thine in
great revenue  heaven bless thee from a tutor  and
discipline come not near thee  let thy blood be thy
direction till thy death  then if she that lays thee
out says thou art a fair corse  i be sworn and
sworn upon she never shrouded any but lazars 
amen  where achilles 


patroclus

what  art thou devout  wast thou in prayer 


thersites

ay  the heavens hear me 
enter achilles


achilles

who there 


patroclus

thersites  my lord 


achilles

where  where  art thou come  why  my cheese  my
digestion  why hast thou not served thyself in to
my table so many meals  come  what agamemnon 


thersites

thy commander  achilles  then tell me  patroclus 
what achilles 


patroclus

thy lord  thersites  then tell me  i pray thee 
what thyself 


thersites

thy knower  patroclus  then tell me  patroclus 
what art thou 


patroclus

thou mayst tell that knowest 


achilles

o  tell  tell 


thersites

i decline the whole question  agamemnon commands
achilles  achilles is my lord  i am patroclus 
knower  and patroclus is a fool 


patroclus

you rascal 


thersites

peace  fool  i have not done 


achilles

he is a privileged man  proceed  thersites 


thersites

agamemnon is a fool  achilles is a fool  thersites
is a fool  and  as aforesaid  patroclus is a fool 


achilles

derive this  come 


thersites

agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles 
achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon 
thersites is a fool to serve such a fool  and
patroclus is a fool positive 


patroclus

why am i a fool 


thersites

make that demand of the prover  it suffices me thou
art  look you  who comes here 


achilles

patroclus  i speak with nobody 
come in with me  thersites 
exit


thersites

here is such patchery  such juggling and such
knavery  all the argument is a cuckold and a
whore  a good quarrel to draw emulous factions
and bleed to death upon  now  the dry serpigo on
the subject  and war and lechery confound all 
exit
enter agamemnon  ulysses  nestor  diomedes  and ajax


agamemnon

where is achilles 


patroclus

within his tent  but ill disposed  my lord 


agamemnon

let it be known to him that we are here 
he shent our messengers  and we lay by
our appertainments  visiting of him 
let him be told so  lest perchance he think
we dare not move the question of our place 
or know not what we are 


patroclus

i shall say so to him 
exit


ulysses

we saw him at the opening of his tent 
he is not sick 


ajax

yes  lion sick  sick of proud heart  you may call it
melancholy  if you will favour the man  but  by my
head   pride  but why  why  let him show us the
cause  a word  my lord 
takes agamemnon aside


nestor

what moves ajax thus to bay at him 


ulysses

achilles hath inveigled his fool from him 


nestor

who  thersites 


ulysses

he 


nestor

then will ajax lack matter  if he have lost his argument 


ulysses

no  you see  he is his argument that has his
argument  achilles 


nestor

all the better  their fraction is more our wish than
their faction  but it was a strong composure a fool
could disunite 


ulysses

the amity that wisdom knits not  folly may easily
untie  here comes patroclus 
re enter patroclus


nestor

no achilles with him 


ulysses

the elephant hath joints  but none for courtesy 
his legs are legs for necessity  not for flexure 


patroclus

achilles bids me say  he is much sorry 
if any thing more than your sport and pleasure
did move your greatness and this noble state
to call upon him  he hopes it is no other
but for your health and your digestion sake 
and after dinner breath 


agamemnon

hear you  patroclus 
we are too well acquainted with these answers 
but his evasion  wing thus swift with scorn 
cannot outfly our apprehensions 
much attribute he hath  and much the reason
why we ascribe it to him  yet all his virtues 
not virtuously on his own part beheld 
do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss 
yea  like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish 
are like to rot untasted  go and tell him 
we come to speak with him  and you shall not sin 
if you do say we think him over proud
and under honest  in self assumption greater
than in the note of judgment  and worthier
than himself
here tend the savage strangeness he puts on 
disguise the holy strength of their command 
and underwrite in an observing kind
his humorous predominance  yea  watch
his pettish lunes  his ebbs  his flows  as if
the passage and whole carriage of this action
rode on his tide  go tell him this  and add 
that if he overhold his price so much 
we none of him  but let him  like an engine
not portable  lie under this report 
 action hither  this cannot go to war 
a stirring dwarf we do allowance give
before a sleeping giant  tell him so 


patroclus

i shall  and bring his answer presently 
exit


agamemnon

in second voice we not be satisfied 
we come to speak with him  ulysses  enter you 
exit ulysses


ajax

what is he more than another 


agamemnon

no more than what he thinks he is 


ajax

is he so much  do you not think he thinks himself a
better man than i am 


agamemnon

no question 


ajax

will you subscribe his thought  and say he is 


agamemnon

no  noble ajax  you are as strong  as valiant  as
wise  no less noble  much more gentle  and altogether
more tractable 


ajax

why should a man be proud  how doth pride grow  i
know not what pride is 


agamemnon

your mind is the clearer  ajax  and your virtues the
fairer  he that is proud eats up himself  pride is
his own glass  his own trumpet  his own chronicle 
and whatever praises itself but in the deed  devours
the deed in the praise 


ajax

i do hate a proud man  as i hate the engendering of toads 


nestor

yet he loves himself  is not strange 
aside
re enter ulysses


ulysses

achilles will not to the field to morrow 


agamemnon

what his excuse 


ulysses

                  he doth rely on none 
but carries on the stream of his dispose
without observance or respect of any 
in will peculiar and in self admission 


agamemnon

why will he not upon our fair request
untent his person and share the air with us 


ulysses

things small as nothing  for request sake only 
he makes important  possess he is with greatness 
and speaks not to himself but with a pride
that quarrels at self breath  imagined worth
holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
that  his mental and his active parts
kingdom achilles in commotion rages
and batters down himself  what should i say 
he is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it
cry  recovery 


agamemnon

                  let ajax go to him 
dear lord  go you and greet him in his tent 
 said he holds you well  and will be led
at your request a little from himself 


ulysses

o agamemnon  let it not be so 
we consecrate the steps that ajax makes
when they go from achilles  shall the proud lord
that bastes his arrogance with his own seam
and never suffers matter of the world
enter his thoughts  save such as do revolve
and ruminate himself  shall he be worshipp 
of that we hold an idol more than he 
no  this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
must not so stale his palm  nobly acquired 
nor  by my will  assubjugate his merit 
as amply titled as achilles is 
by going to achilles 
that were to enlard his fat already pride
and add more coals to cancer when he burns
with entertaining great hyperion 
this lord go to him  jupiter forbid 
and say in thunder  go to him 


nestor

 aside to diomedes   o  this is well  he rubs the
vein of him 


diomedes

 aside to nestor   and how his silence drinks up
this applause 


ajax

if i go to him  with my armed fist i pash him o the face 


agamemnon

o  no  you shall not go 


ajax

an a  be proud with me  i pheeze his pride 
let me go to him 


ulysses

not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel 


ajax

a paltry  insolent fellow 


nestor

how he describes himself 


ajax

can he not be sociable 


ulysses

the raven chides blackness 


ajax

i let his humours blood 


agamemnon

he will be the physician that should be the patient 


ajax

an all men were o  my mind 


ulysses

wit would be out of fashion 


ajax

a  should not bear it so  a  should eat swords first 
shall pride carry it 


nestor

an  twould  you carry half 


ulysses

a  would have ten shares 


ajax

i will knead him  i make him supple 


nestor

he not yet through warm  force him with praises 
pour in  pour in  his ambition is dry 


ulysses

 to agamemnon   my lord  you feed too much on this dislike 


nestor

our noble general  do not do so 


diomedes

you must prepare to fight without achilles 


ulysses

why   this naming of him does him harm 
here is a man but  before his face 
i will be silent 


nestor

                  wherefore should you so 
he is not emulous  as achilles is 


ulysses

know the whole world  he is as valiant 


ajax

a whoreson dog  that shall pelter thus with us 
would he were a trojan 


nestor

what a vice were it in ajax now 


ulysses

if he were proud 


diomedes

or covetous of praise 


ulysses

ay  or surly borne 


diomedes

or strange  or self affected 


ulysses

thank the heavens  lord  thou art of sweet composure 
praise him that got thee  she that gave thee suck 
famed be thy tutor  and thy parts of nature
thrice famed  beyond all erudition 
but he that disciplined thy arms to fight 
let mars divide eternity in twain 
and give him half  and  for thy vigour 
bull bearing milo his addition yield
to sinewy ajax  i will not praise thy wisdom 
which  like a bourn  a pale  a shore  confines
thy spacious and dilated parts  here nestor 
instructed by the antiquary times 
he must  he is  he cannot but be wise 
put pardon  father nestor  were your days
as green as ajax  and your brain so temper d 
you should not have the eminence of him 
but be as ajax 


ajax

                  shall i call you father 


nestor

ay  my good son 


diomedes

                  be ruled by him  lord ajax 


ulysses

there is no tarrying here  the hart achilles
keeps thicket  please it our great general
to call together all his state of war 
fresh kings are come to troy  to morrow
we must with all our main of power stand fast 
and here a lord come knights from east to west 
and cull their flower  ajax shall cope the best 


agamemnon

go we to council  let achilles sleep 
light boats sail swift  though greater hulks draw deep 
exeunt
