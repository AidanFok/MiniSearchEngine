exit boy


pandarus

have you seen my cousin 


troilus

no  pandarus  i stalk about her door 
like a strange soul upon the stygian banks
staying for waftage  o  be thou my charon 
and give me swift transportance to those fields
where i may wallow in the lily beds
proposed for the deserver  o gentle pandarus 
from cupid shoulder pluck his painted wings
and fly with me to cressid 


pandarus

walk here i  the orchard  i bring her straight 
exit


troilus

i am giddy  expectation whirls me round 
the imaginary relish is so sweet
that it enchants my sense  what will it be 
when that the watery palate tastes indeed
love thrice repured nectar  death  i fear me 
swooning destruction  or some joy too fine 
too subtle potent  tuned too sharp in sweetness 
for the capacity of my ruder powers 
i fear it much  and i do fear besides 
that i shall lose distinction in my joys 
as doth a battle  when they charge on heaps
the enemy flying 
re enter pandarus


pandarus

she making her ready  she come straight  you
must be witty now  she does so blush  and fetches
her wind so short  as if she were frayed with a
sprite  i fetch her  it is the prettiest
villain  she fetches her breath as short as a
new ta sparrow 
exit


troilus

even such a passion doth embrace my bosom 
my heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse 
and all my powers do their bestowing lose 
like vassalage at unawares encountering
the eye of majesty 
re enter pandarus with cressida


pandarus

come  come  what need you blush  shame a baby 
here she is now  swear the oaths now to her that
you have sworn to me  what  are you gone again 
you must be watched ere you be made tame  must you 
come your ways  come your ways  an you draw backward 
we put you i  the fills  why do you not speak to
her  come  draw this curtain  and let see your
picture  alas the day  how loath you are to offend
daylight  an  dark  you close sooner 
so  so  rub on  and kiss the mistress  how now 
a kiss in fee farm  build there  carpenter  the air
is sweet  nay  you shall fight your hearts out ere
i part you  the falcon as the tercel  for all the
ducks i  the river  go to  go to 


troilus

you have bereft me of all words  lady 


pandarus

words pay no debts  give her deeds  but she 
bereave you o  the deeds too  if she call your
activity in question  what  billing again  here 
 witness whereof the parties interchangeably 
come in  come in  i go get a fire 
exit


cressida

will you walk in  my lord 


troilus

o cressida  how often have i wished me thus 


cressida

wished  my lord  the gods grant o my lord 


troilus

what should they grant  what makes this pretty
abruption  what too curious dreg espies my sweet
lady in the fountain of our love 


cressida

more dregs than water  if my fears have eyes 


troilus

fears make devils of cherubims  they never see truly 


cressida

blind fear  that seeing reason leads  finds safer
footing than blind reason stumbling without fear  to
fear the worst oft cures the worse 


troilus

o  let my lady apprehend no fear  in all cupid 
pageant there is presented no monster 


cressida

nor nothing monstrous neither 


troilus

nothing  but our undertakings  when we vow to weep
seas  live in fire  eat rocks  tame tigers  thinking
it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed 
this is the monstruosity in love  lady  that the will
is infinite and the execution confined  that the
desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit 


cressida

they say all lovers swear more performance than they
are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
perform  vowing more than the perfection of ten and
discharging less than the tenth part of one  they
that have the voice of lions and the act of hares 
are they not monsters 


troilus

are there such  such are not we  praise us as we
are tasted  allow us as we prove  our head shall go
bare till merit crown it  no perfection in reversion
shall have a praise in present  we will not name
desert before his birth  and  being born  his addition
shall be humble  few words to fair faith  troilus
shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst
shall be a mock for his truth  and what truth can
speak truest not truer than troilus 


cressida

will you walk in  my lord 
re enter pandarus


pandarus

what  blushing still  have you not done talking yet 


cressida

well  uncle  what folly i commit  i dedicate to you 


pandarus

i thank you for that  if my lord get a boy of you 
you give him me  be true to my lord  if he
flinch  chide me for it 


troilus

you know now your hostages  your uncle word and my
firm faith 


pandarus

nay  i give my word for her too  our kindred 
though they be long ere they are wooed  they are
constant being won  they are burs  i can tell you 
they stick where they are thrown 


cressida

boldness comes to me now  and brings me heart 
prince troilus  i have loved you night and day
for many weary months 


troilus

why was my cressid then so hard to win 


cressida

hard to seem won  but i was won  my lord 
with the first glance that ever pardon me 
if i confess much  you will play the tyrant 
i love you now  but not  till now  so much
but i might master it  in faith  i lie 
my thoughts were like unbridled children  grown
too headstrong for their mother  see  we fools 
why have i blabb d  who shall be true to us 
when we are so unsecret to ourselves 
but  though i loved you well  i woo you not 
and yet  good faith  i wish myself a man 
or that we women had men privilege
of speaking first  sweet  bid me hold my tongue 
for in this rapture i shall surely speak
the thing i shall repent  see  see  your silence 
cunning in dumbness  from my weakness draws
my very soul of counsel  stop my mouth 


troilus

and shall  albeit sweet music issues thence 


pandarus

pretty  i  faith 


cressida

my lord  i do beseech you  pardon me 
 not my purpose  thus to beg a kiss 
i am ashamed  o heavens  what have i done 
for this time will i take my leave  my lord 


troilus

your leave  sweet cressid 


pandarus

leave  an you take leave till to morrow morning 


cressida

pray you  content you 


troilus

what offends you  lady 


cressida

sir  mine own company 


troilus

you cannot shun yourself 


cressida

        let me go and try 
i have a kind of self resides with you 
but an unkind self  that itself will leave 
to be another fool  i would be gone 
where is my wit  i know not what i speak 


troilus

well know they what they speak that speak so wisely 


cressida

perchance  my lord  i show more craft than love 
and fell so roundly to a large confession 
to angle for your thoughts  but you are wise 
or else you love not  for to be wise and love
exceeds man might  that dwells with gods above 


troilus

o that i thought it could be in a woman 
as  if it can  i will presume in you 
to feed for aye her ramp and flames of love 
to keep her constancy in plight and youth 
outliving beauty outward  with a mind
that doth renew swifter than blood decays 
or that persuasion could but thus convince me 
that my integrity and truth to you
might be affronted with the match and weight
of such a winnow purity in love 
how were i then uplifted  but  alas 
i am as true as truth simplicity
and simpler than the infancy of truth 


cressida

in that i war with you 


troilus

o virtuous fight 
when right with right wars who shall be most right 
true swains in love shall in the world to come
approve their truths by troilus  when their rhymes 
full of protest  of oath and big compare 
want similes  truth tired with iteration 
as true as steel  as plantage to the moon 
as sun to day  as turtle to her mate 
as iron to adamant  as earth to the centre 
yet  after all comparisons of truth 
as truth authentic author to be cited 
 true as troilus  shall crown up the verse 
and sanctify the numbers 


cressida

prophet may you be 
if i be false  or swerve a hair from truth 
when time is old and hath forgot itself 
when waterdrops have worn the stones of troy 
and blind oblivion swallow cities up 
and mighty states characterless are grated
to dusty nothing  yet let memory 
from false to false  among false maids in love 
upbraid my falsehood  when they said  false
as air  as water  wind  or sandy earth 
as fox to lamb  as wolf to heifer calf 
pard to the hind  or stepdame to her son 
 yea  let them say  to stick the heart of falsehood 
 false as cressid 


pandarus

go to  a bargain made  seal it  seal it  i be the
witness  here i hold your hand  here my cousin s 
if ever you prove false one to another  since i have
taken such pains to bring you together  let all
pitiful goers between be called to the world end
after my name  call them all pandars  let all
constant men be troiluses  all false women cressids 
and all brokers between pandars  say  amen 


troilus

amen 


cressida

amen 


pandarus

amen  whereupon i will show you a chamber with a
bed  which bed  because it shall not speak of your
pretty encounters  press it to death  away 
and cupid grant all tongue tied maidens here
bed  chamber  pandar to provide this gear
