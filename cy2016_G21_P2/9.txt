enter hotspur  worcester  and douglas


hotspur

well said  my noble scot  if speaking truth
in this fine age were not thought flattery 
such attribution should the douglas have 
as not a soldier of this season stamp
should go so general current through the world 
by god  i cannot flatter  i do defy
the tongues of soothers  but a braver place
in my heart love hath no man than yourself 
nay  task me to my word  approve me  lord 


earl of douglas

thou art the king of honour 
no man so potent breathes upon the ground
but i will beard him 


hotspur

do so  and  well 
enter a messenger with letters
what letters hast thou there i can but thank you 


messenger

these letters come from your father 


hotspur

letters from him  why comes he not himself 


messenger

he cannot come  my lord  he is grievous sick 


hotspur

 zounds  how has he the leisure to be sick
in such a rustling time  who leads his power 
under whose government come they along 


messenger

his letters bear his mind  not i  my lord 


earl of worcester

i prithee  tell me  doth he keep his bed 


messenger

he did  my lord  four days ere i set forth 
and at the time of my departure thence
he was much fear by his physicians 


earl of worcester

i would the state of time had first been whole
ere he by sickness had been visited 
his health was never better worth than now 


hotspur

sick now  droop now  this sickness doth infect
the very life blood of our enterprise 
 catching hither  even to our camp 
he writes me here  that inward sickness 
and that his friends by deputation could not
so soon be drawn  nor did he think it meet
to lay so dangerous and dear a trust
on any soul removed but on his own 
yet doth he give us bold advertisement 
that with our small conjunction we should on 
to see how fortune is disposed to us 
for  as he writes  there is no quailing now 
because the king is certainly possess 
of all our purposes  what say you to it 


earl of worcester

your father sickness is a maim to us 


hotspur

a perilous gash  a very limb lopp off 
and yet  in faith  it is not  his present want
seems more than we shall find it  were it good
to set the exact wealth of all our states
all at one cast  to set so rich a main
on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour 
it were not good  for therein should we read
the very bottom and the soul of hope 
the very list  the very utmost bound
of all our fortunes 


earl of douglas

 faith  and so we should 
where now remains a sweet reversion 
we may boldly spend upon the hope of what
is to come in 
a comfort of retirement lives in this 


hotspur

a rendezvous  a home to fly unto 
if that the devil and mischance look big
upon the maidenhead of our affairs 


earl of worcester

but yet i would your father had been here 
the quality and hair of our attempt
brooks no division  it will be thought
by some  that know not why he is away 
that wisdom  loyalty and mere dislike
of our proceedings kept the earl from hence 
and think how such an apprehension
may turn the tide of fearful faction
and breed a kind of question in our cause 
for well you know we of the offering side
must keep aloof from strict arbitrement 
and stop all sight holes  every loop from whence
the eye of reason may pry in upon us 
this absence of your father draws a curtain 
that shows the ignorant a kind of fear
before not dreamt of 


hotspur

you strain too far 
i rather of his absence make this use 
it lends a lustre and more great opinion 
a larger dare to our great enterprise 
than if the earl were here  for men must think 
if we without his help can make a head
to push against a kingdom  with his help
we shall o it topsy turvy down 
yet all goes well  yet all our joints are whole 


earl of douglas

as heart can think  there is not such a word
spoke of in scotland as this term of fear 
enter sir richard vernon


hotspur

my cousin vernon  welcome  by my soul 


vernon

pray god my news be worth a welcome  lord 
the earl of westmoreland  seven thousand strong 
is marching hitherwards  with him prince john 


hotspur

no harm  what more 


vernon

and further  i have learn d 
the king himself in person is set forth 
or hitherwards intended speedily 
with strong and mighty preparation 


hotspur

he shall be welcome too  where is his son 
the nimble footed madcap prince of wales 
and his comrades  that daff the world aside 
and bid it pass 


vernon

                  all furnish d  all in arms 
all plumed like estridges that with the wind
baited like eagles having lately bathed 
glittering in golden coats  like images 
as full of spirit as the month of may 
and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer 
wanton as youthful goats  wild as young bulls 
i saw young harry  with his beaver on 
his cuisses on his thighs  gallantly arm 
rise from the ground like feather mercury 
and vaulted with such ease into his seat 
as if an angel dropp down from the clouds 
to turn and wind a fiery pegasus
and witch the world with noble horsemanship 


hotspur

no more  no more  worse than the sun in march 
this praise doth nourish agues  let them come 
they come like sacrifices in their trim 
and to the fire eyed maid of smoky war
all hot and bleeding will we offer them 
the mailed mars shall on his altar sit
up to the ears in blood  i am on fire
to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
and yet not ours  come  let me taste my horse 
who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
against the bosom of the prince of wales 
harry to harry shall  hot horse to horse 
meet and ne part till one drop down a corse 
o that glendower were come 


vernon

there is more news 
i learn in worcester  as i rode along 
he cannot draw his power this fourteen days 


earl of douglas

that the worst tidings that i hear of yet 


worcester

ay  by my faith  that bears a frosty sound 


hotspur

what may the king whole battle reach unto 


vernon

to thirty thousand 


hotspur

forty let it be 
my father and glendower being both away 
the powers of us may serve so great a day
come  let us take a muster speedily 
doomsday is near  die all  die merrily 


earl of douglas

talk not of dying  i am out of fear
of death or death hand for this one half year 
exeunt
