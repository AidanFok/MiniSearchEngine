enter agamemnon  ulysses  diomedes  nestor  ajax  menelaus  and calchas


calchas

now  princes  for the service i have done you 
the advantage of the time prompts me aloud
to call for recompense  appear it to your mind
that  through the sight i bear in things to love 
i have abandon troy  left my possession 
incurr a traitor name  exposed myself 
from certain and possess conveniences 
to doubtful fortunes  sequestering from me all
that time  acquaintance  custom and condition
made tame and most familiar to my nature 
and here  to do you service  am become
as new into the world  strange  unacquainted 
i do beseech you  as in way of taste 
to give me now a little benefit 
out of those many register in promise 
which  you say  live to come in my behalf 


agamemnon

what wouldst thou of us  trojan  make demand 


calchas

you have a trojan prisoner  call antenor 
yesterday took  troy holds him very dear 
oft have you often have you thanks therefore 
desired my cressid in right great exchange 
whom troy hath still denied  but this antenor 
i know  is such a wrest in their affairs
that their negotiations all must slack 
wanting his manage  and they will almost
give us a prince of blood  a son of priam 
in change of him  let him be sent  great princes 
and he shall buy my daughter  and her presence
shall quite strike off all service i have done 
in most accepted pain 


agamemnon

let diomedes bear him 
and bring us cressid hither  calchas shall have
what he requests of us  good diomed 
furnish you fairly for this interchange 
withal bring word if hector will to morrow
be answer in his challenge  ajax is ready 


diomedes

this shall i undertake  and  a burden
which i am proud to bear 
exeunt diomedes and calchas
enter achilles and patroclus  before their tent


ulysses

achilles stands i  the entrance of his tent 
please it our general to pass strangely by him 
as if he were forgot  and  princes all 
lay negligent and loose regard upon him 
i will come last   like he question me
why such unplausive eyes are bent on him 
if so  i have derision medicinable 
to use between your strangeness and his pride 
which his own will shall have desire to drink 
it may be good  pride hath no other glass
to show itself but pride  for supple knees
feed arrogance and are the proud man fees 


agamemnon

we execute your purpose  and put on
a form of strangeness as we pass along 
so do each lord  and either greet him not 
or else disdainfully  which shall shake him more
than if not look on  i will lead the way 


achilles

what  comes the general to speak with me 
you know my mind  i fight no more  troy 


agamemnon

what says achilles  would he aught with us 


nestor

would you  my lord  aught with the general 


achilles

no 


nestor

nothing  my lord 


agamemnon

the better 
exeunt agamemnon and nestor


achilles

good day  good day 


menelaus

how do you  how do you 
exit


achilles

what  does the cuckold scorn me 


ajax

how now  patroclus 


achilles

good morrow  ajax 


ajax

ha 


achilles

good morrow 


ajax

ay  and good next day too 
exit


achilles

what mean these fellows  know they not achilles 


patroclus

they pass by strangely  they were used to bend
to send their smiles before them to achilles 
to come as humbly as they used to creep
to holy altars 


achilles

                  what  am i poor of late 
 certain  greatness  once fall out with fortune 
must fall out with men too  what the declined is
he shall as soon read in the eyes of others
as feel in his own fall  for men  like butterflies 
show not their mealy wings but to the summer 
and not a man  for being simply man 
hath any honour  but honour for those honours
that are without him  as place  riches  favour 
prizes of accident as oft as merit 
which when they fall  as being slippery standers 
the love that lean on them as slippery too 
do one pluck down another and together
die in the fall  but  not so with me 
fortune and i are friends  i do enjoy
at ample point all that i did possess 
save these men looks  who do  methinks  find out
something not worth in me such rich beholding
as they have often given  here is ulysses 
i interrupt his reading 
how now ulysses 


ulysses

                  now  great thetis  son 


achilles

what are you reading 


ulysses

a strange fellow here
writes me   man  how dearly ever parted 
how much in having  or without or in 
cannot make boast to have that which he hath 
nor feels not what he owes  but by reflection 
as when his virtues shining upon others
heat them and they retort that heat again
to the first giver 


achilles

this is not strange  ulysses 
the beauty that is borne here in the face
the bearer knows not  but commends itself
to others  eyes  nor doth the eye itself 
that most pure spirit of sense  behold itself 
not going from itself  but eye to eye opposed
salutes each other with each other form 
for speculation turns not to itself 
till it hath travell and is mirror there
where it may see itself  this is not strange at all 


ulysses

i do not strain at the position 
it is familiar but at the author drift 
who  in his circumstance  expressly proves
that no man is the lord of any thing 
though in and of him there be much consisting 
till he communicate his parts to others 
nor doth he of himself know them for aught
till he behold them form in the applause
where they extended  who  like an arch 
reverberates
the voice again  or  like a gate of steel
fronting the sun  receives and renders back
his figure and his heat   i was much wrapt in this 
and apprehended here immediately
the unknown ajax 
heavens  what a man is there  a very horse 
that has he knows not what  nature  what things there are
most abject in regard and dear in use 
what things again most dear in the esteem
and poor in worth  now shall we see to morrow 
an act that very chance doth throw upon him 
ajax renown d  o heavens  what some men do 
while some men leave to do 
how some men creep in skittish fortune hall 
whiles others play the idiots in her eyes 
how one man eats into another pride 
while pride is fasting in his wantonness 
to see these grecian lords why  even already
they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder 
as if his foot were on brave hector breast
and great troy shrieking 


achilles

i do believe it  for they pass by me
as misers do by beggars  neither gave to me
good word nor look  what  are my deeds forgot 


ulysses

time hath  my lord  a wallet at his back 
wherein he puts alms for oblivion 
a great sized monster of ingratitudes 
those scraps are good deeds past  which are devour 
as fast as they are made  forgot as soon
as done  perseverance  dear my lord 
keeps honour bright  to have done is to hang
quite out of fashion  like a rusty mail
in monumental mockery  take the instant way 
for honour travels in a strait so narrow 
where one but goes abreast  keep then the path 
for emulation hath a thousand sons
that one by one pursue  if you give way 
or hedge aside from the direct forthright 
like to an enter tide  they all rush by
and leave you hindmost 
or like a gallant horse fall in first rank 
lie there for pavement to the abject rear 
o er run and trampled on  then what they do in present 
though less than yours in past  must o yours 
for time is like a fashionable host
that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand 
and with his arms outstretch d  as he would fly 
grasps in the comer  welcome ever smiles 
and farewell goes out sighing  o  let not
virtue seek
remuneration for the thing it was 
for beauty  wit 
high birth  vigour of bone  desert in service 
love  friendship  charity  are subjects all
to envious and calumniating time 
one touch of nature makes the whole world kin 
that all with one consent praise new born gawds 
though they are made and moulded of things past 
and give to dust that is a little gilt
more laud than gilt o er dusted 
the present eye praises the present object 
then marvel not  thou great and complete man 
that all the greeks begin to worship ajax 
since things in motion sooner catch the eye
than what not stirs  the cry went once on thee 
and still it might  and yet it may again 
if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
and case thy reputation in thy tent 
whose glorious deeds  but in these fields of late 
made emulous missions  the gods themselves
and drave great mars to faction 


achilles

of this my privacy
i have strong reasons 


ulysses

but  your privacy
the reasons are more potent and heroical 
 known  achilles  that you are in love
with one of priam daughters 


achilles

ha  known 


ulysses

is that a wonder 
the providence that in a watchful state
knows almost every grain of plutus  gold 
finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps 
keeps place with thought and almost  like the gods 
does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles 
there is a mystery with whom relation
durst never meddle in the soul of state 
which hath an operation more divine
than breath or pen can give expressure to 
all the commerce that you have had with troy
as perfectly is ours as yours  my lord 
and better would it fit achilles much
to throw down hector than polyxena 
but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home 
when fame shall in our islands sound her trump 
and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing 
 hector sister did achilles win 
but our great ajax bravely beat down him 
farewell  my lord  i as your lover speak 
the fool slides o the ice that you should break 
exit


patroclus

to this effect  achilles  have i moved you 
a woman impudent and mannish grown
is not more loathed than an effeminate man
in time of action  i stand condemn for this 
they think my little stomach to the war
and your great love to me restrains you thus 
sweet  rouse yourself  and the weak wanton cupid
shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold 
and  like a dew drop from the lion mane 
be shook to air 


achilles

                  shall ajax fight with hector 


patroclus

ay  and perhaps receive much honour by him 


achilles

i see my reputation is at stake
my fame is shrewdly gored 


patroclus

o  then  beware 
those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves 
omission to do what is necessary
seals a commission to a blank of danger 
and danger  like an ague  subtly taints
even then when we sit idly in the sun 


achilles

go call thersites hither  sweet patroclus 
i send the fool to ajax and desire him
to invite the trojan lords after the combat
to see us here unarm d  i have a woman longing 
an appetite that i am sick withal 
to see great hector in his weeds of peace 
to talk with him and to behold his visage 
even to my full of view 
enter thersites
a labour saved 


thersites

a wonder 


achilles

what 


thersites

ajax goes up and down the field  asking for himself 


achilles

how so 


thersites

he must fight singly to morrow with hector  and is so
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
raves in saying nothing 


achilles

how can that be 


thersites

why  he stalks up and down like a peacock a stride
and a stand  ruminates like an hostess that hath no
arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning 
bites his lip with a politic regard  as who should
say  were wit in this head  an  out 
and so there is  but it lies as coldly in him as fire
in a flint  which will not show without knocking 
the man undone forever  for if hector break not his
neck i  the combat  he break  himself in
vain glory  he knows not me  i said  morrow 
ajax  and he replies  thanks  agamemnon  what think
you of this man that takes me for the general  he 
grown a very land fish  language less  a monster 
a plague of opinion  a man may wear it on both
sides  like a leather jerkin 


achilles

thou must be my ambassador to him  thersites 


thersites

who  i  why  he answer nobody  he professes not
answering  speaking is for beggars  he wears his
tongue in arms  i will put on his presence  let
patroclus make demands to me  you shall see the
pageant of ajax 


achilles

to him  patroclus  tell him i humbly desire the
valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector
to come unarmed to my tent  and to procure
safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous
and most illustrious six or seven times honoured
captain general of the grecian army  agamemnon 
et cetera  do this 


patroclus

jove bless great ajax 


thersites

hum 


patroclus

i come from the worthy achilles 


thersites

ha 


patroclus

who most humbly desires you to invite hector to his tent 


thersites

hum 


patroclus

and to procure safe conduct from agamemnon 


thersites

agamemnon 


patroclus

ay  my lord 


thersites

ha 


patroclus

what say you to t 


thersites

god b  wi  you  with all my heart 


patroclus

your answer  sir 


thersites

if to morrow be a fair day  by eleven o it will
go one way or other  howsoever  he shall pay for me
ere he has me 


patroclus

your answer  sir 


thersites

fare you well  with all my heart 


achilles

why  but he is not in this tune  is he 


thersites

no  but he out o  tune thus  what music will be in
him when hector has knocked out his brains  i know
not  but  i am sure  none  unless the fiddler apollo
get his sinews to make catlings on 


achilles

come  thou shalt bear a letter to him straight 


thersites

let me bear another to his horse  for that the more
capable creature 


achilles

my mind is troubled  like a fountain stirr d 
and i myself see not the bottom of it 
exeunt achilles and patroclus


thersites

would the fountain of your mind were clear again 
that i might water an ass at it  i had rather be a
tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance
