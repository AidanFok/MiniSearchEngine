scene iv  the same  pandarus  house 


enter pandarus and cressida


pandarus

be moderate  be moderate 


cressida

why tell you me of moderation 
the grief is fine  full  perfect  that i taste 
and violenteth in a sense as strong
as that which causeth it  how can i moderate it 
if i could temporize with my affection 
or brew it to a weak and colder palate 
the like allayment could i give my grief 
my love admits no qualifying dross 
no more my grief  in such a precious loss 


pandarus

here  here  here he comes 
enter troilus
ah  sweet ducks 


cressida

o troilus  troilus 
embracing him


pandarus

what a pair of spectacles is here 
let me embrace too   heart  as the goodly saying is 
 o heart  heavy heart 
why sigh thou without breaking 
where he answers again 
 thou canst not ease thy smart
by friendship nor by speaking 
there was never a truer rhyme  let us cast away
nothing  for we may live to have need of such a
verse  we see it  we see it  how now  lambs 


troilus

cressid  i love thee in so strain a purity 
that the bless gods  as angry with my fancy 
more bright in zeal than the devotion which
cold lips blow to their deities  take thee from me 


cressida

have the gods envy 


pandarus

ay  ay  ay  ay   too plain a case 


cressida

and is it true that i must go from troy 


troilus

a hateful truth 


cressida

                  what  and from troilus too 


troilus

from troy and troilus 


cressida

is it possible 


troilus

and suddenly  where injury of chance
puts back leave taking  justles roughly by
all time of pause  rudely beguiles our lips
of all rejoindure  forcibly prevents
our lock embrasures  strangles our dear vows
even in the birth of our own labouring breath 
we two  that with so many thousand sighs
did buy each other  must poorly sell ourselves
with the rude brevity and discharge of one 
injurious time now with a robber haste
crams his rich thievery up  he knows not how 
as many farewells as be stars in heaven 
with distinct breath and consign kisses to them 
he fumbles up into a lose adieu 
and scants us with a single famish kiss 
distasted with the salt of broken tears 


aeneas

 within   my lord  is the lady ready 


troilus

hark  you are call d  some say the genius so
cries  come  to him that instantly must die 
bid them have patience  she shall come anon 


pandarus

where are my tears  rain  to lay this wind  or
my heart will be blown up by the root 
exit


cressida

i must then to the grecians 


troilus

no remedy 


cressida

a woful cressid  the merry greeks 
when shall we see again 


troilus

hear me  my love  be thou but true of heart 


cressida

i true  how now  what wicked deem is this 


troilus

nay  we must use expostulation kindly 
for it is parting from us 
i speak not  thou true  as fearing thee 
for i will throw my glove to death himself 
that there no maculation in thy heart 
but  thou true  say i  to fashion in
my sequent protestation  be thou true 
and i will see thee 


cressida

o  you shall be exposed  my lord  to dangers
as infinite as imminent  but i be true 


troilus

and i grow friend with danger  wear this sleeve 


cressida

and you this glove  when shall i see you 


troilus

i will corrupt the grecian sentinels 
to give thee nightly visitation 
but yet be true 


cressida

                  o heavens   true  again 


troilus

hear while i speak it  love 
the grecian youths are full of quality 
they loving  well composed with gifts of nature 
flowing and swelling o with arts and exercise 
how novelty may move  and parts with person 
alas  a kind of godly jealousy 
which  i beseech you  call a virtuous sin 
makes me afeard 


cressida

                  o heavens  you love me not 


troilus

die i a villain  then 
in this i do not call your faith in question
so mainly as my merit  i cannot sing 
nor heel the high lavolt  nor sweeten talk 
nor play at subtle games  fair virtues all 
to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant 
but i can tell that in each grace of these
there lurks a still and dumb discoursive devil
that tempts most cunningly  but be not tempted 


cressida

do you think i will 


troilus

no 
but something may be done that we will not 
and sometimes we are devils to ourselves 
when we will tempt the frailty of our powers 
presuming on their changeful potency 


aeneas

 within   nay  good my lord 


troilus

come  kiss  and let us part 


paris

 within   brother troilus 


troilus

good brother  come you hither 
and bring aeneas and the grecian with you 


cressida

my lord  will you be true 


troilus

who  i  alas  it is my vice  my fault 
whiles others fish with craft for great opinion 
i with great truth catch mere simplicity 
whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns 
with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare 
fear not my truth  the moral of my wit
is  and true  there all the reach of it 
enter aeneas  paris  antenor  deiphobus  and diomedes
welcome  sir diomed  here is the lady
which for antenor we deliver you 
at the port  lord  i give her to thy hand 
and by the way possess thee what she is 
entreat her fair  and  by my soul  fair greek 
if e thou stand at mercy of my sword 
name cressida and thy life shall be as safe
as priam is in ilion 


diomedes

fair lady cressid 
so please you  save the thanks this prince expects 
the lustre in your eye  heaven in your cheek 
pleads your fair usage  and to diomed
you shall be mistress  and command him wholly 


troilus

grecian  thou dost not use me courteously 
to shame the zeal of my petition to thee
in praising her  i tell thee  lord of greece 
she is as far high soaring o thy praises
as thou unworthy to be call her servant 
i charge thee use her well  even for my charge 
for  by the dreadful pluto  if thou dost not 
though the great bulk achilles be thy guard 
i cut thy throat 


diomedes

o  be not moved  prince troilus 
let me be privileged by my place and message 
to be a speaker free  when i am hence
i answer to my lust  and know you  lord 
i nothing do on charge  to her own worth
she shall be prized  but that you say  be so 
i speak it in my spirit and honour   no 


troilus

come  to the port  i tell thee  diomed 
this brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head 
lady  give me your hand  and  as we walk 
to our own selves bend we our needful talk 
exeunt troilus  cressida  and diomedes
trumpet within


paris

hark  hector trumpet 


aeneas

how have we spent this morning 
the prince must think me tardy and remiss 
that sore to ride before him to the field 


paris

 troilus  fault  come  come  to field with him 


deiphobus

let us make ready straight 


aeneas

yea  with a bridegroom fresh alacrity 
let us address to tend on hector heels 
the glory of our troy doth this day lie
on his fair worth and single chivalry 
exeunt
