achilles bids you welcome 


menelaus

patroclus

but that no argument for kissing now 
for this popp paris in his hardiment 
and parted thus you and your argument 


ulysses

o deadly gall  and theme of all our scorns 
for which we lose our heads to gild his horns 


patroclus

menelaus

i give you boot  i give you three for one 


cressida

exit with cressida


nestor

a woman of quick sense 


ulysses

fie  fie upon her 
there language in her eye  her cheek  her lip 
nay  her foot speaks  her wanton spirits look out
at every joint and motive of her body 
o  these encounterers  so glib of tongue 
that give accosting welcome ere it comes 
and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
to every ticklish reader  set them down
for sluttish spoils of opportunity
and daughters of the game 
trumpet within


all

the trojans  trumpet 


agamemnon

yonder comes the troop 
enter hector  armed  aeneas  troilus  and other trojans  with attendants


aeneas

hail  all you state of greece  what shall be done
to him that victory commands  or do you purpose
a victor shall be known  will you the knights
shall to the edge of all extremity
pursue each other  or shall be divided
by any voice or order of the field 
hector bade ask 


agamemnon

which way would hector have it 


aeneas

he cares not  he obey conditions 


achilles

 done like hector  but securely done 
a little proudly  and great deal misprizing
the knight opposed 


aeneas

if not achilles  sir 
what is your name 


achilles

                  if not achilles  nothing 


aeneas

therefore achilles  but  whate er  know this 
in the extremity of great and little 
valour and pride excel themselves in hector 
the one almost as infinite as all 
the other blank as nothing  weigh him well 
and that which looks like pride is courtesy 
this ajax is half made of hector blood 
in love whereof  half hector stays at home 
half heart  half hand  half hector comes to seek
this blended knight  half trojan and half greek 


achilles

a maiden battle  then  o  i perceive you 
re enter diomedes


agamemnon

here is sir diomed  go  gentle knight 
stand by our ajax  as you and lord aeneas
consent upon the order of their fight 
so be it  either to the uttermost 
or else a breath  the combatants being kin
half stints their strife before their strokes begin 
ajax and hector enter the lists


ulysses

they are opposed already 


agamemnon

what trojan is that same that looks so heavy 


ulysses

the youngest son of priam  a true knight 
not yet mature  yet matchless  firm of word 
speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue 
not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm d 
his heart and hand both open and both free 
for what he has he gives  what thinks he shows 
yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty 
nor dignifies an impure thought with breath 
manly as hector  but more dangerous 
for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
to tender objects  but he in heat of action
is more vindicative than jealous love 
they call him troilus  and on him erect
a second hope  as fairly built as hector 
thus says aeneas  one that knows the youth
even to his inches  and with private soul
did in great ilion thus translate him to me 
alarum  hector and ajax fight


agamemnon

they are in action 


nestor

now  ajax  hold thine own 


troilus

hector  thou sleep st 
awake thee 


agamemnon

his blows are well disposed  there  ajax 


diomedes

you must no more 
trumpets cease


aeneas

                  princes  enough  so please you 


ajax

i am not warm yet  let us fight again 


diomedes

as hector pleases 


hector

                  why  then will i no more 
thou art  great lord  my father sister son 
a cousin german to great priam seed 
the obligation of our blood forbids
a gory emulation  us twain 
were thy commixtion greek and trojan so
that thou couldst say  hand is grecian all 
and this is trojan  the sinews of this leg
all greek  and this all troy  my mother blood
runs on the dexter cheek  and this sinister
bounds in my father s  by jove multipotent 
thou shouldst not bear from me a greekish member
wherein my sword had not impressure made
of our rank feud  but the just gods gainsay
that any drop thou borrow from thy mother 
my sacred aunt  should by my mortal sword
be drain d  let me embrace thee  ajax 
by him that thunders  thou hast lusty arms 
hector would have them fall upon him thus 
cousin  all honour to thee 


ajax

i thank thee  hector
thou art too gentle and too free a man 
i came to kill thee  cousin  and bear hence
a great addition earned in thy death 


hector

not neoptolemus so mirable 
on whose bright crest fame with her loud oyes
cries  is he  could promise to himself
a thought of added honour torn from hector 


aeneas

there is expectance here from both the sides 
what further you will do 


hector

we answer it 
the issue is embracement  ajax  farewell 


ajax

if i might in entreaties find success 
as seld i have the chance i would desire
my famous cousin to our grecian tents 


diomedes

 agamemnon wish  and great achilles
doth long to see unarm the valiant hector 


hector

aeneas  call my brother troilus to me 
and signify this loving interview
to the expecters of our trojan part 
desire them home  give me thy hand  my cousin 
i will go eat with thee and see your knights 


ajax

great agamemnon comes to meet us here 


hector

the worthiest of them tell me name by name 
but for achilles  mine own searching eyes
shall find him by his large and portly size 


agamemnon

worthy of arms  as welcome as to one
that would be rid of such an enemy 
but that no welcome  understand more clear 
what past and what to come is strew with husks
and formless ruin of oblivion 
but in this extant moment  faith and troth 
strain purely from all hollow bias drawing 
bids thee  with most divine integrity 
from heart of very heart  great hector  welcome 


hector

i thank thee  most imperious agamemnon 


agamemnon

 to troilus   my well famed lord of troy  no
less to you 


menelaus

let me confirm my princely brother greeting 
you brace of warlike brothers  welcome hither 


hector

who must we answer 


aeneas

the noble menelaus 


hector

o  you  my lord  by mars his gauntlet  thanks 
mock not  that i affect the untraded oath 
your quondam wife swears still by venus  glove 
she well  but bade me not commend her to you 


menelaus

name her not now  sir  she a deadly theme 


hector

o  pardon  i offend 


nestor

i have  thou gallant trojan  seen thee oft
labouring for destiny make cruel way
through ranks of greekish youth  and i have seen thee 
as hot as perseus  spur thy phrygian steed 
despising many forfeits and subduements 
when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i  the air 
not letting it decline on the declined 
that i have said to some my standers by
 lo  jupiter is yonder  dealing life 
and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath 
when that a ring of greeks have hemm thee in 
like an olympian wrestling  this have i seen 
but this thy countenance  still lock in steel 
i never saw till now  i knew thy grandsire 
and once fought with him  he was a soldier good 
but  by great mars  the captain of us all 
never saw like thee  let an old man embrace thee 
and  worthy warrior  welcome to our tents 


aeneas

 the old nestor 


hector

let me embrace thee  good old chronicle 
that hast so long walk hand in hand with time 
most reverend nestor  i am glad to clasp thee 


nestor

i would my arms could match thee in contention 
as they contend with thee in courtesy 


hector

i would they could 


nestor

ha 
by this white beard  i fight with thee to morrow 
well  welcome  welcome  i have seen the time 


ulysses

i wonder now how yonder city stands
when we have here her base and pillar by us 


hector

i know your favour  lord ulysses  well 
ah  sir  there many a greek and trojan dead 
since first i saw yourself and diomed
in ilion  on your greekish embassy 


ulysses

sir  i foretold you then what would ensue 
my prophecy is but half his journey yet 
for yonder walls  that pertly front your town 
yond towers  whose wanton tops do buss the clouds 
must kiss their own feet 


hector

i must not believe you 
there they stand yet  and modestly i think 
the fall of every phrygian stone will cost
a drop of grecian blood  the end crowns all 
and that old common arbitrator  time 
will one day end it 


ulysses

so to him we leave it 
most gentle and most valiant hector  welcome 
after the general  i beseech you next
to feast with me and see me at my tent 


achilles

i shall forestall thee  lord ulysses  thou 
now  hector  i have fed mine eyes on thee 
i have with exact view perused thee  hector 
and quoted joint by joint 


hector

is this achilles 


achilles

i am achilles 


hector

stand fair  i pray thee  let me look on thee 


achilles

behold thy fill 


hector

                  nay  i have done already 


achilles

thou art too brief  i will the second time 
as i would buy thee  view thee limb by limb 


hector

o  like a book of sport thou read me o er 
but there more in me than thou understand st 
why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye 


achilles

tell me  you heavens  in which part of his body
shall i destroy him  whether there  or there  or there 
that i may give the local wound a name
and make distinct the very breach whereout
hector great spirit flew  answer me  heavens 


hector

it would discredit the blest gods  proud man 
to answer such a question  stand again 
think thou to catch my life so pleasantly
as to prenominate in nice conjecture
where thou wilt hit me dead 


achilles

i tell thee  yea 


hector

wert thou an oracle to tell me so 
i not believe thee  henceforth guard thee well 
for i not kill thee there  nor there  nor there 
but  by the forge that stithied mars his helm 
i kill thee every where  yea  o and o er 
you wisest grecians  pardon me this brag 
his insolence draws folly from my lips 
but i endeavour deeds to match these words 
or may i never 


ajax

                  do not chafe thee  cousin 
and you  achilles  let these threats alone 
till accident or purpose bring you to t 
you may have every day enough of hector
if you have stomach  the general state  i fear 
can scarce entreat you to be odd with him 


hector

i pray you  let us see you in the field 
we have had pelting wars  since you refused
the grecians  cause 


achilles

dost thou entreat me  hector 
to morrow do i meet thee  fell as death 
to night all friends 


hector

thy hand upon that match 


agamemnon

first  all you peers of greece  go to my tent 
there in the full convive we  afterwards 
as hector leisure and your bounties shall
concur together  severally entreat him 
beat loud the tabourines  let the trumpets blow 
that this great soldier may his welcome know 
exeunt all except troilus and ulysses


troilus

my lord ulysses  tell me  i beseech you 
in what place of the field doth calchas keep 


ulysses

at menelaus  tent  most princely troilus 
there diomed doth feast with him to night 
who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth 
but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
on the fair cressid 


troilus

shall sweet lord  be bound to you so much 
after we part from agamemnon tent 
to bring me thither 


ulysses

you shall command me  sir 
as gentle tell me  of what honour was
this cressida in troy  had she no lover there
that wails her absence 


troilus

o  sir  to such as boasting show their scars
a mock is due  will you walk on  my lord 
she was beloved  she loved  she is  and doth 
but still sweet love is food for fortune tooth 
exeunt
