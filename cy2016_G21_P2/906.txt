loads o  gravel i  the back  lethargies  cold
palsies  raw eyes  dirt rotten livers  wheezing
lungs  bladders full of imposthume  sciaticas 
limekilns i  the palm  incurable bone ache  and the
rivelled fee simple of the tetter  take and take
again such preposterous discoveries 


patroclus

immaterial skein of sleave silk  thou green sarcenet
flap for a sore eye  thou tassel of a prodigal 
purse  thou  ah  how the poor world is pestered
with such waterflies  diminutives of nature

an oath that i have sworn  i will not break it 
fall greeks  fail fame  honour or go or stay 
my major vow lies here  this i obey 
come  come  thersites  help to trim my tent 
this night in banqueting must all be spent 
away  patroclus 
exeunt achilles and patroclus


thersites

with too much blood and too little brain  these two
may run mad  but  if with too much brain and too
little blood they do  i be a curer of madmen 
here agamemnon  an honest fellow enough and one
that loves quails  but he has not so much brain as
earwax  and the goodly transformation of jupiter
there  his brother  the bull the primitive statue 
and oblique memorial of cuckolds  a thrifty
shoeing horn in a chain  hanging at his brother 
leg to what form but that he is  should wit larded
with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to 
to an ass  were nothing  he is both ass and ox  to
an ox  were nothing  he is both ox and ass  to be a
dog  a mule  a cat  a fitchew  a toad  a lizard  an
owl  a puttock  or a herring without a roe  i would
not care  but to be menelaus  i would conspire
against destiny  ask me not  what i would be  if i
were not thersites  for i care not to be the louse
of a lazar  so i were not menelaus  hey day 
spirits and fires 
enter hector  troilus  ajax  agamemnon  ulysses  nestor  menelaus  and diomedes  with lights

thersites

that same diomed a false hearted rogue  a most
unjust knave  i will no more trust him when he leers
than i will a serpent when he hisses  he will spend
his mouth  and promise  like brabbler the hound 
but when he performs  astronomers foretell it  it
is prodigious  there will come some change  the sun
borrows of the moon  when diomed keeps his
word  i will rather leave to see hector  than
not to dog him  they say he keeps a trojan
drab  and uses the traitor calchas  tent  i 
after  nothing but lechery  all incontinent varlets 
exit
