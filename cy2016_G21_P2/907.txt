scene x  another part of the plains 


enter aeneas and trojans


aeneas

stand  ho  yet are we masters of the field 
never go home  here starve we out the night 
enter troilus


troilus

hector is slain 


all

                  hector  the gods forbid 


troilus

he dead  and at the murderer horse tail 
in beastly sort  dragg through the shameful field 
frown on  you heavens  effect your rage with speed 
sit  gods  upon your thrones  and smile at troy 
i say  at once let your brief plagues be mercy 
and linger not our sure destructions on 


aeneas

my lord  you do discomfort all the host 


troilus

you understand me not that tell me so 
i do not speak of flight  of fear  of death 
but dare all imminence that gods and men
address their dangers in  hector is gone 
who shall tell priam so  or hecuba 
let him that will a screech owl aye be call d 
go in to troy  and say there  hector dead 
there is a word will priam turn to stone 
make wells and niobes of the maids and wives 
cold statues of the youth  and  in a word 
scare troy out of itself  but  march away 
hector is dead  there is no more to say 
stay yet  you vile abominable tents 
thus proudly pight upon our phrygian plains 
let titan rise as early as he dare 
i through and through you  and  thou great sized coward 
no space of earth shall sunder our two hates 
i haunt thee like a wicked conscience still 
that mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy thoughts 
strike a free march to troy  with comfort go 
hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe 
exeunt aeneas and trojans
as troilus is going out  enter  from the other side  pandarus


pandarus

but hear you  hear you 


troilus

hence  broker lackey  ignomy and shame
pursue thy life  and live aye with thy name 
exit


pandarus

a goodly medicine for my aching bones  o world 
world  world  thus is the poor agent despised 
o traitors and bawds  how earnestly are you set
a work  and how ill requited  why should our
endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed 
what verse for it  what instance for it  let me see 
full merrily the humble bee doth sing 
till he hath lost his honey and his sting 
and being once subdued in armed tail 
sweet honey and sweet notes together fail 
good traders in the flesh  set this in your
painted cloths 
as many as be here of pander hall 
your eyes  half out  weep out at pandar fall 
or if you cannot weep  yet give some groans 
though not for me  yet for your aching bones 
brethren and sisters of the hold door trade 
some two months hence my will shall here be made 
it should be now  but that my fear is this 
some galled goose of winchester would hiss 
till then i sweat and seek about for eases 
and at that time bequeathe you my diseases 
exit
