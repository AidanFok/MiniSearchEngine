                  what  this 


diomedes

ay  that 


cressida

o  all you gods  o pretty  pretty pledge 
thy master now lies thinking in his bed
of thee and me  and sighs  and takes my glove 
and gives memorial dainty kisses to it 
as i kiss thee  nay  do not snatch it from me 
he that takes that doth take my heart withal 


diomedes

i had your heart before  this follows it 


troilus

i did swear patience 


cressida

you shall not have it  diomed  faith  you shall not 
i give you something else 


diomedes

i will have this  whose was it 


cressida

it is no matter 


diomedes

come  tell me whose it was 


cressida

 one that loved me better than you will 
but  now you have it  take it 


diomedes

whose was it 


cressida

by all diana waiting women yond 
and by herself  i will not tell you whose 


diomedes

to morrow will i wear it on my helm 
and grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it 


troilus

wert thou the devil  and worest it on thy horn 
it should be challenged 


cressida

well  well   done   past  and yet it is not 
i will not keep my word 


diomedes

why  then  farewell 
thou never shalt mock diomed again 


cressida

you shall not go  one cannot speak a word 
but it straight starts you 


diomedes

i do not like this fooling 


thersites

nor i  by pluto  but that that likes not you pleases me best 


diomedes

what  shall i come  the hour 


cressida

ay  come o jove do come i shall be plagued 


diomedes

farewell till then 


cressida

good night  i prithee  come 
exit diomedes
troilus  farewell  one eye yet looks on thee
but with my heart the other eye doth see 
ah  poor our sex  this fault in us i find 
the error of our eye directs our mind 
what error leads must err  o  then conclude
minds sway by eyes are full of turpitude 
exit


thersites

a proof of strength she could not publish more 
unless she said   my mind is now turn whore 


ulysses

all done  my lord 


troilus

it is 


ulysses

why stay we  then 


troilus

to make a recordation to my soul
of every syllable that here was spoke 
but if i tell how these two did co act 
shall i not lie in publishing a truth 
sith yet there is a credence in my heart 
an esperance so obstinately strong 
that doth invert the attest of eyes and ears 
as if those organs had deceptious functions 
created only to calumniate 
was cressid here 


ulysses

                  i cannot conjure  trojan 


troilus

she was not  sure 


ulysses

                  most sure she was 


troilus

why  my negation hath no taste of madness 


ulysses

nor mine  my lord  cressid was here but now 


troilus

let it not be believed for womanhood 
think  we had mothers  do not give advantage
to stubborn critics  apt  without a theme 
for depravation  to square the general sex
by cressid rule  rather think this not cressid 


ulysses

what hath she done  prince  that can soil our mothers 


troilus

nothing at all  unless that this were she 


thersites

will he swagger himself out on own eyes 


troilus

this she  no  this is diomed cressida 
if beauty have a soul  this is not she 
if souls guide vows  if vows be sanctimonies 
if sanctimony be the gods  delight 
if there be rule in unity itself 
this is not she  o madness of discourse 
that cause sets up with and against itself 
bi fold authority  where reason can revolt
without perdition  and loss assume all reason
without revolt  this is  and is not  cressid 
within my soul there doth conduce a fight
of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
divides more wider than the sky and earth 
and yet the spacious breadth of this division
admits no orifex for a point as subtle
as ariachne broken woof to enter 
instance  o instance  strong as pluto gates 
cressid is mine  tied with the bonds of heaven 
instance  o instance  strong as heaven itself 
the bonds of heaven are slipp d  dissolved  and loosed 
and with another knot  five finger tied 
the fractions of her faith  orts of her love 
the fragments  scraps  the bits and greasy relics
of her o er eaten faith  are bound to diomed 


ulysses

may worthy troilus be half attach 
with that which here his passion doth express 


troilus

ay  greek  and that shall be divulged well
in characters as red as mars his heart
inflamed with venus  never did young man fancy
with so eternal and so fix a soul 
hark  greek  as much as i do cressid love 
so much by weight hate i her diomed 
that sleeve is mine that he bear on his helm 
were it a casque composed by vulcan skill 
my sword should bite it  not the dreadful spout
which shipmen do the hurricano call 
constringed in mass by the almighty sun 
shall dizzy with more clamour neptune ear
in his descent than shall my prompted sword
falling on diomed 


thersites

he tickle it for his concupy 


troilus

o cressid  o false cressid  false  false  false 
let all untruths stand by thy stained name 
and they seem glorious 


ulysses

o  contain yourself
your passion draws ears hither 
enter aeneas


aeneas

i have been seeking you this hour  my lord 
hector  by this  is arming him in troy 
ajax  your guard  stays to conduct you home 


troilus

have with you  prince  my courteous lord  adieu 
farewell  revolted fair  and  diomed 
stand fast  and wear a castle on thy head 


ulysses

i bring you to the gates 


troilus

accept distracted thanks 
exeunt troilus  aeneas  and ulysses


thersites

would i could meet that rogue diomed  i would
croak like a raven  i would bode  i would bode 
patroclus will give me any thing for the
intelligence of this whore  the parrot will not
do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab 
lechery  lechery  still  wars and lechery  nothing
else holds fashion  a burning devil take them
