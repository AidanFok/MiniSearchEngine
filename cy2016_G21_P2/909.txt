scene iii  troy  before priam palace 


enter hector and andromache


andromache

when was my lord so much ungently temper d 
to stop his ears against admonishment 
unarm  unarm  and do not fight to day 


hector

you train me to offend you  get you in 
by all the everlasting gods  i go 


andromache

my dreams will  sure  prove ominous to the day 


hector

no more  i say 
enter cassandra


cassandra

                  where is my brother hector 


andromache

here  sister  arm d  and bloody in intent 
consort with me in loud and dear petition 
pursue we him on knees  for i have dream 
of bloody turbulence  and this whole night
hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter 


cassandra

o   true 


hector

                  ho  bid my trumpet sound 


cassandra

no notes of sally  for the heavens  sweet brother 


hector

be gone  i say  the gods have heard me swear 


cassandra

the gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows 
they are polluted offerings  more abhorr 
than spotted livers in the sacrifice 


andromache

o  be persuaded  do not count it holy
to hurt by being just  it is as lawful 
for we would give much  to use violent thefts 
and rob in the behalf of charity 


cassandra

it is the purpose that makes strong the vow 
but vows to every purpose must not hold 
unarm  sweet hector 


hector

hold you still  i say 
mine honour keeps the weather of my fate 
lie every man holds dear  but the brave man
holds honour far more precious dear than life 
enter troilus
how now  young man  mean thou to fight to day 


andromache

cassandra  call my father to persuade 
exit cassandra


hector

no  faith  young troilus  doff thy harness  youth 
i am to day i  the vein of chivalry 
let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong 
and tempt not yet the brushes of the war 
unarm thee  go  and doubt thou not  brave boy 
i stand to day for thee and me and troy 


troilus

brother  you have a vice of mercy in you 
which better fits a lion than a man 


hector

what vice is that  good troilus  chide me for it 


troilus

when many times the captive grecian falls 
even in the fan and wind of your fair sword 
you bid them rise  and live 


hector

o fair play 


troilus

                  fool play  by heaven  hector 


hector

how now  how now 


troilus

                  for the love of all the gods 
let leave the hermit pity with our mothers 
and when we have our armours buckled on 
the venom vengeance ride upon our swords 
spur them to ruthful work  rein them from ruth 


hector

fie  savage  fie 


troilus

                  hector  then  wars 


hector

troilus  i would not have you fight to day 


troilus

who should withhold me 
not fate  obedience  nor the hand of mars
beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire 
not priamus and hecuba on knees 
their eyes o with recourse of tears 
not you  my brother  with your true sword drawn 
opposed to  hinder me  should stop my way 
but by my ruin 
re enter cassandra  with priam


cassandra

lay hold upon him  priam  hold him fast 
he is thy crutch  now if thou lose thy stay 
thou on him leaning  and all troy on thee 
fall all together 


priam

                  come  hector  come  go back 
thy wife hath dream d  thy mother hath had visions 
cassandra doth foresee  and i myself
am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
to tell thee that this day is ominous 
therefore  come back 


hector

aeneas is a field 
and i do stand engaged to many greeks 
even in the faith of valour  to appear
this morning to them 


priam

ay  but thou shalt not go 


hector

i must not break my faith 
you know me dutiful  therefore  dear sir 
let me not shame respect  but give me leave
to take that course by your consent and voice 
which you do here forbid me  royal priam 


cassandra

o priam  yield not to him 


andromache

do not  dear father 


hector

andromache  i am offended with you 
upon the love you bear me  get you in 
exit andromache


troilus

this foolish  dreaming  superstitious girl
makes all these bodements 


cassandra

o  farewell  dear hector 
look  how thou diest  look  how thy eye turns pale 
look  how thy wounds do bleed at many vents 
hark  how troy roars  how hecuba cries out 
how poor andromache shrills her dolours forth 
behold  distraction  frenzy and amazement 
like witless antics  one another meet 
and all cry  hector  hector dead  o hector 


troilus

away  away 


cassandra

farewell  yet  soft  hector  take my leave 
thou dost thyself and all our troy deceive 
exit


hector

you are amazed  my liege  at her exclaim 
go in and cheer the town  we forth and fight 
do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night 


priam

farewell  the gods with safety stand about thee 
exeunt severally priam and hector  alarums


troilus

they are at it  hark  proud diomed  believe 
i come to lose my arm  or win my sleeve 
enter pandarus


pandarus

do you hear  my lord  do you hear 


troilus

what now 


pandarus

here a letter come from yond poor girl 


troilus

let me read 


pandarus

a whoreson tisick  a whoreson rascally tisick so
troubles me  and the foolish fortune of this girl 
and what one thing  what another  that i shall
leave you one o  these days  and i have a rheum
in mine eyes too  and such an ache in my bones
that  unless a man were cursed  i cannot tell what
to think on t  what says she there 


troilus

words  words  mere words  no matter from the heart 
the effect doth operate another way 
tearing the letter
go  wind  to wind  there turn and change together 
my love with words and errors still she feeds 
but edifies another with her deeds 
exeunt severally
