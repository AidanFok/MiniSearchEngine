scene iii  field of battle betwixt sandal castle and wakefield 


alarums  enter rutland and his tutor


rutland

ah  whither shall i fly to  their hands 
ah  tutor  look where bloody clifford comes 
enter clifford and soldiers


clifford

chaplain  away  thy priesthood saves thy life 
as for the brat of this accursed duke 
whose father slew my father  he shall die 


tutor

and i  my lord  will bear him company 


clifford

soldiers  away with him 


tutor

ah  clifford  murder not this innocent child 
lest thou be hated both of god and man 
exit  dragged off by soldiers


clifford

how now  is he dead already  or is it fear
that makes him close his eyes  i open them 


rutland

so looks the pent up lion o the wretch
that trembles under his devouring paws 
and so he walks  insulting o his prey 
and so he comes  to rend his limbs asunder 
ah  gentle clifford  kill me with thy sword 
and not with such a cruel threatening look 
sweet clifford  hear me speak before i die 
i am too mean a subject for thy wrath 
be thou revenged on men  and let me live 


clifford

in vain thou speak st  poor boy  my father blood
hath stopp the passage where thy words should enter 


rutland

then let my father blood open it again 
he is a man  and  clifford  cope with him 


clifford

had thy brethren here  their lives and thine
were not revenge sufficient for me 
no  if i digg up thy forefathers  graves
and hung their rotten coffins up in chains 
it could not slake mine ire  nor ease my heart 
the sight of any of the house of york
is as a fury to torment my soul 
and till i root out their accursed line
and leave not one alive  i live in hell 
therefore 
lifting his hand


rutland

o  let me pray before i take my death 
to thee i pray  sweet clifford  pity me 


clifford

such pity as my rapier point affords 


rutland

i never did thee harm  why wilt thou slay me 


clifford

thy father hath 


rutland

                  but  ere i was born 
thou hast one son  for his sake pity me 
lest in revenge thereof  sith god is just 
he be as miserably slain as i 
ah  let me live in prison all my days 
and when i give occasion of offence 
then let me die  for now thou hast no cause 


clifford

no cause 
thy father slew my father  therefore  die 
stabs him


rutland

di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae 
dies


clifford

plantagenet  i come  plantagenet 
and this thy son blood cleaving to my blade
shall rust upon my weapon  till thy blood 
congeal with this  do make me wipe off both
