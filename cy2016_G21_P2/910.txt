whore masterly villain  with the sleeve  back to the
dissembling luxurious drab  of a sleeveless errand 
o  the t side  the policy of those crafty
swearing rascals  that stale old mouse eaten dry
cheese  nestor  and that same dog fox  ulysses  is
not proved worthy a blackberry  they set me up  in
policy  that mongrel cur  ajax  against that dog of
as bad a kind  achilles  and now is the cur ajax
prouder than the cur achilles  and will not arm
to day  whereupon the grecians begin to proclaim
barbarism  and policy grows into an ill opinion
