scene viii  another part of the plains 


enter hector


hector

most putrefied core  so fair without 
thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life 
now is my day work done  i take good breath 
rest  sword  thou hast thy fill of blood and death 
puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him
enter achilles and myrmidons


achilles

look  hector  how the sun begins to set 
how ugly night comes breathing at his heels 
even with the vail and darking of the sun 
to close the day up  hector life is done 


hector

i am unarm d  forego this vantage  greek 


achilles

strike  fellows  strike  this is the man i seek 
hector falls
so  ilion  fall thou next  now  troy  sink down 
here lies thy heart  thy sinews  and thy bone 
on  myrmidons  and cry you all amain 
 hath the mighty hector slain 
a retreat sounded
hark  a retire upon our grecian part 


myrmidons

the trojan trumpets sound the like  my lord 


achilles

the dragon wing of night o the earth 
and  stickler like  the armies separates 
my half supp sword  that frankly would have fed 
pleased with this dainty bait  thus goes to bed 
sheathes his sword
come  tie his body to my horse tail 
along the field i will the trojan trail 
exeunt
