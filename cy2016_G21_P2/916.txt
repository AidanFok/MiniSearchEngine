scene i  duke orsino palace 


enter duke orsino  curio  and other lords  musicians attending


duke orsino

if music be the food of love  play on 
give me excess of it  that  surfeiting 
the appetite may sicken  and so die 
that strain again  it had a dying fall 
o  it came o my ear like the sweet sound 
that breathes upon a bank of violets 
stealing and giving odour  enough  no more 
 not so sweet now as it was before 
o spirit of love  how quick and fresh art thou 
that  notwithstanding thy capacity
receiveth as the sea  nought enters there 
of what validity and pitch soe er 
but falls into abatement and low price 
even in a minute  so full of shapes is fancy
that it alone is high fantastical 


curio

will you go hunt  my lord 


duke orsino

what  curio 


curio

the hart 


duke orsino

        why  so i do  the noblest that i have 
o  when mine eyes did see olivia first 
methought she purged the air of pestilence 
that instant was i turn into a hart 
and my desires  like fell and cruel hounds 
e since pursue me 
enter valentine
how now  what news from her 


valentine

so please my lord  i might not be admitted 
but from her handmaid do return this answer 
the element itself  till seven years  heat 
shall not behold her face at ample view 
but  like a cloistress  she will veiled walk
and water once a day her chamber round
with eye offending brine  all this to season
a brother dead love  which she would keep fresh
and lasting in her sad remembrance 


duke orsino

o  she that hath a heart of that fine frame
to pay this debt of love but to a brother 
how will she love  when the rich golden shaft
hath kill the flock of all affections else
that live in her  when liver  brain and heart 
these sovereign thrones  are all supplied  and fill 
her sweet perfections with one self king 
away before me to sweet beds of flowers 
love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers 
exeunt
