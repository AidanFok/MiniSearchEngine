o knight thou lackest a cup of canary  when did i
see thee so put down 


sir andrew

never in your life  i think  unless you see canary
put me down  methinks sometimes i have no more wit
than a christian or an ordinary man has  but i am a
great eater of beef and i believe that does harm to my wit 


sir toby belch

no question 


sir andrew

an i thought that  i forswear it  i ride home
to morrow  sir toby 


sir toby belch

pourquoi  my dear knight 


sir andrew

what is  pourquoi  do or not do  i would i had
bestowed that time in the tongues that i have in
fencing  dancing and bear baiting  o  had i but
followed the arts 


sir toby belch

then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair 


sir andrew

why  would that have mended my hair 


sir toby belch

past question  for thou seest it will not curl by nature 


sir andrew

but it becomes me well enough  does not 


sir toby belch

excellent  it hangs like flax on a distaff  and i
hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
and spin it off 


sir andrew

faith  i home to morrow  sir toby  your niece
will not be seen  or if she be  it four to one
she none of me  the count himself here hard by woos her 


sir toby belch

she none o  the count  she not match above
her degree  neither in estate  years  nor wit  i
have heard her swear t  tut  there life in t 
man 


sir andrew

i stay a month longer  i am a fellow o  the
strangest mind i  the world  i delight in masques
and revels sometimes altogether 


sir toby belch

art thou good at these kickshawses  knight 


sir andrew

as any man in illyria  whatsoever he be  under the
degree of my betters  and yet i will not compare
with an old man 


sir toby belch

what is thy excellence in a galliard  knight 


sir andrew

faith  i can cut a caper 


sir toby belch

and i can cut the mutton to t 


sir andrew

and i think i have the back trick simply as strong
as any man in illyria 


sir toby belch

wherefore are these things hid  wherefore have
these gifts a curtain before  em  are they like to
take dust  like mistress mall picture  why dost
thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
a coranto  my very walk should be a jig  i would not
so much as make water but in a sink a pace  what
dost thou mean  is it a world to hide virtues in 
i did think  by the excellent constitution of thy
leg  it was formed under the star of a galliard 


sir andrew

ay   strong  and it does indifferent well in a
flame coloured stock  shall we set about some revels 


sir toby belch

caper  ha  higher  ha  ha  excellent 
exeunt
