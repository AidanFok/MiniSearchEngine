scene v  olivia house 


enter maria and clown


maria

nay  either tell me where thou hast been  or i will
not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
way of thy excuse  my lady will hang thee for thy absence 


clown

let her hang me  he that is well hanged in this
world needs to fear no colours 


maria

make that good 


clown

he shall see none to fear 


maria

a good lenten answer  i can tell thee where that
saying was born  of  fear no colours 


clown

where  good mistress mary 


maria

in the wars  and that may you be bold to say in your foolery 


clown

well  god give them wisdom that have it  and those
that are fools  let them use their talents 


maria

yet you will be hanged for being so long absent  or 
to be turned away  is not that as good as a hanging to you 


clown

many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage  and 
for turning away  let summer bear it out 


maria

you are resolute  then 


clown

not so  neither  but i am resolved on two points 


maria

that if one break  the other will hold  or  if both
break  your gaskins fall 


clown

apt  in good faith  very apt  well  go thy way  if
sir toby would leave drinking  thou wert as witty a
piece of eve flesh as any in illyria 


maria

peace  you rogue  no more o  that  here comes my
lady  make your excuse wisely  you were best 
exit


clown

wit  an be thy will  put me into good fooling 
those wits  that think they have thee  do very oft
prove fools  and i  that am sure i lack thee  may
pass for a wise man  for what says quinapalus 
 a witty fool  than a foolish wit 
enter olivia with malvolio
god bless thee  lady 


olivia

take the fool away 


clown

do you not hear  fellows  take away the lady 


olivia

go to  you a dry fool  i no more of you 
besides  you grow dishonest 


clown

two faults  madonna  that drink and good counsel
will amend  for give the dry fool drink  then is
the fool not dry  bid the dishonest man mend
himself  if he mend  he is no longer dishonest  if
he cannot  let the botcher mend him  any thing
that mended is but patched  virtue that
transgresses is but patched with sin  and sin that
amends is but patched with virtue  if that this
simple syllogism will serve  so  if it will not 
what remedy  as there is no true cuckold but
calamity  so beauty a flower  the lady bade take
away the fool  therefore  i say again  take her away 


olivia

sir  i bade them take away you 


clown

misprision in the highest degree  lady  cucullus non
facit monachum  that as much to say as i wear not
motley in my brain  good madonna  give me leave to
prove you a fool 


olivia

can you do it 


clown

dexterously  good madonna 


olivia

make your proof 


clown

i must catechise you for it  madonna  good my mouse
of virtue  answer me 


olivia

well  sir  for want of other idleness  i bide your proof 


clown

good madonna  why mournest thou 


olivia

good fool  for my brother death 


clown

i think his soul is in hell  madonna 


olivia

i know his soul is in heaven  fool 


clown

the more fool  madonna  to mourn for your brother 
soul being in heaven  take away the fool  gentlemen 


olivia

what think you of this fool  malvolio  doth he not mend 


malvolio

yes  and shall do till the pangs of death shake him 
infirmity  that decays the wise  doth ever make the
better fool 


clown

god send you  sir  a speedy infirmity  for the
better increasing your folly  sir toby will be
sworn that i am no fox  but he will not pass his
word for two pence that you are no fool 


olivia

how say you to that  malvolio 


malvolio

i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
barren rascal  i saw him put down the other day
with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
than a stone  look you now  he out of his guard
already  unless you laugh and minister occasion to
him  he is gagged  i protest  i take these wise men 
that crow so at these set kind of fools  no better
than the fools  zanies 


olivia

oh  you are sick of self love  malvolio  and taste
with a distempered appetite  to be generous 
guiltless and of free disposition  is to take those
things for bird bolts that you deem cannon bullets 
there is no slander in an allowed fool  though he do
nothing but rail  nor no railing in a known discreet
man  though he do nothing but reprove 


clown

now mercury endue thee with leasing  for thou
speakest well of fools 
re enter maria

desires to speak with you

brains  for here he comes one of thy kin has a
most weak pia mater

draught above heat makes him a fool  the second mads
him  and a third drowns him

malvolio

madam  yond young fellow swears he will speak with
you  i told him you were sick  he takes on him to
understand so much  and therefore comes to speak
with you  i told him you were asleep  he seems to
have a foreknowledge of that too  and therefore
comes to speak with you  what is to be said to him 
lady  he fortified against any denial 


olivia

tell him he shall not speak with me 


malvolio

has been told so  and he says  he stand at your
door like a sheriff post  and be the supporter to
a bench  but he speak with you 


olivia

what kind o  man is he 


malvolio

olivia

of what personage and years is he 


malvolio

not yet old enough for a man  nor young enough for
a boy  as a squash is before  a peascod  or a
cooling when  almost an apple   with him
in standing water  between boy and man  he is very
well favoured and he speaks very shrewishly  one
would think his mother milk were scarce out of him 


olivia

let him approach  call in my gentlewoman 


malvolio

gentlewoman  my lady calls 
exit
re enter maria


olivia

enter viola  and attendants


viola

the honourable lady of the house  which is she 


olivia

speak to me  i shall answer for her 
your will 


viola

most radiant  exquisite and unmatchable beauty i
pray you  tell me if this be the lady of the house 
for i never saw her  i would be loath to cast away
my speech  for besides that it is excellently well
penned  i have taken great pains to con it  good
beauties  let me sustain no scorn  i am very
comptible  even to the least sinister usage 


olivia

whence came you  sir 


viola

i can say little more than i have studied  and that
question out of my part  good gentle one  give me
modest assurance if you be the lady of the house 
that i may proceed in my speech 


olivia

are you a comedian 


viola

no  my profound heart  and yet  by the very fangs
of malice i swear  i am not that i play  are you
the lady of the house 


olivia

if i do not usurp myself  i am 


viola

most certain  if you are she  you do usurp
yourself  for what is yours to bestow is not yours
to reserve  but this is from my commission  i will
on with my speech in your praise  and then show you
the heart of my message 


olivia

come to what is important in t  i forgive you the praise 


viola

alas  i took great pains to study it  and  poetical 


olivia

it is the more like to be feigned  i pray you 
keep it in  i heard you were saucy at my gates 
and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
than to hear you  if you be not mad  be gone  if
you have reason  be brief   not that time of
moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue 


maria

will you hoist sail  sir  here lies your way 


viola

no  good swabber  i am to hull here a little
longer  some mollification for your giant  sweet
lady  tell me your mind  i am a messenger 


olivia

sure  you have some hideous matter to deliver  when
the courtesy of it is so fearful  speak your office 


viola

it alone concerns your ear  i bring no overture of
war  no taxation of homage  i hold the olive in my
hand  my words are as fun of peace as matter 


olivia

yet you began rudely  what are you  what would you 


viola

the rudeness that hath appeared in me have i
learned from my entertainment  what i am  and what i
would  are as secret as maidenhead  to your ears 
divinity  to any other s  profanation 


olivia

give us the place alone  we will hear this divinity 
exeunt maria and attendants
now  sir  what is your text 


viola

most sweet lady 


olivia

a comfortable doctrine  and much may be said of it 
where lies your text 


viola

in orsino bosom 


olivia

in his bosom  in what chapter of his bosom 


viola

to answer by the method  in the first of his heart 


olivia

o  i have read it  it is heresy  have you no more to say 


viola

good madam  let me see your face 


olivia

have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
with my face  you are now out of your text  but
we will draw the curtain and show you the picture 
look you  sir  such a one i was this present  is 
not well done 
unveiling


viola

excellently done  if god did all 


olivia

 in grain  sir   endure wind and weather 


viola

 beauty truly blent  whose red and white
nature own sweet and cunning hand laid on 
lady  you are the cruell she alive 
if you will lead these graces to the grave
and leave the world no copy 


olivia

o  sir  i will not be so hard hearted  i will give
out divers schedules of my beauty  it shall be
inventoried  and every particle and utensil
labelled to my will  as  item  two lips 
indifferent red  item  two grey eyes  with lids to
them  item  one neck  one chin  and so forth  were
you sent hither to praise me 


viola

i see you what you are  you are too proud 
but  if you were the devil  you are fair 
my lord and master loves you  o  such love
could be but recompensed  though you were crown 
the nonpareil of beauty 


olivia

how does he love me 


viola

with adorations  fertile tears 
with groans that thunder love  with sighs of fire 


olivia

your lord does know my mind  i cannot love him 
yet i suppose him virtuous  know him noble 
of great estate  of fresh and stainless youth 
in voices well divulged  free  learn and valiant 
and in dimension and the shape of nature
a gracious person  but yet i cannot love him 
he might have took his answer long ago 


viola

if i did love you in my master flame 
with such a suffering  such a deadly life 
in your denial i would find no sense 
i would not understand it 


olivia

why  what would you 


viola

make me a willow cabin at your gate 
and call upon my soul within the house 
write loyal cantons of contemned love
and sing them loud even in the dead of night 
halloo your name to the reverberate hills
and make the babbling gossip of the air
cry out  olivia  o  you should not rest
between the elements of air and earth 
but you should pity me 


olivia

you might do much 
what is your parentage 


viola

above my fortunes  yet my state is well 
i am a gentleman 


olivia

                  get you to your lord 
i cannot love him  let him send no more 
unless  perchance  you come to me again 
to tell me how he takes it  fare you well 
i thank you for your pains  spend this for me 


viola

i am no fee post  lady  keep your purse 
my master  not myself  lacks recompense 
love make his heart of flint that you shall love 
and let your fervor  like my master s  be
placed in contempt  farewell  fair cruelty 
exit


olivia

 is your parentage 
 my fortunes  yet my state is well 
i am a gentleman  i be sworn thou art 
thy tongue  thy face  thy limbs  actions and spirit 
do give thee five fold blazon  not too fast 
soft  soft 
unless the master were the man  how now 
even so quickly may one catch the plague 
methinks i feel this youth perfections
with an invisible and subtle stealth
to creep in at mine eyes  well  let it be 
what ho  malvolio 
re enter malvolio


malvolio

                  here  madam  at your service 


olivia

run after that same peevish messenger 
the county man  he left this ring behind him 
would i or not  tell him i none of it 
desire him not to flatter with his lord 
nor hold him up with hopes  i am not for him 
if that the youth will come this way to morrow 
i give him reasons for t  hie thee  malvolio 


malvolio

madam  i will 
exit


olivia

i do i know not what  and fear to find
mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind 
fate  show thy force  ourselves we do not owe 
what is decreed must be  and be this so
