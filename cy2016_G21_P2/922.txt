malvolio

were not you even now with the countess olivia 


viola

even now  sir  on a moderate pace i have since
arrived but hither 


malvolio

she returns this ring to you  sir  you might have
saved me my pains  to have taken it away yourself 
she adds  moreover  that you should put your lord
into a desperate assurance she will none of him 
and one thing more  that you be never so hardy to
come again in his affairs  unless it be to report
your lord taking of this  receive it so 


viola

she took the ring of me  i none of it 


malvolio

come  sir  you peevishly threw it to her  and her
will is  it should be so returned  if it be worth
stooping for  there it lies in your eye  if not  be
it his that finds it 
exit


viola

i left no ring with her  what means this lady 
fortune forbid my outside have not charm her 
she made good view of me  indeed  so much 
that sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue 
for she did speak in starts distractedly 
she loves me  sure  the cunning of her passion
invites me in this churlish messenger 
none of my lord ring  why  he sent her none 
i am the man  if it be so  as  tis 
poor lady  she were better love a dream 
disguise  i see  thou art a wickedness 
wherein the pregnant enemy does much 
how easy is it for the proper false
in women waxen hearts to set their forms 
alas  our frailty is the cause  not we 
for such as we are made of  such we be 
how will this fadge  my master loves her dearly 
and i  poor monster  fond as much on him 
and she  mistaken  seems to dote on me 
what will become of this  as i am man 
my state is desperate for my master love 
as i am woman now alas the day 
what thriftless sighs shall poor olivia breathe 
o time  thou must untangle this  not i 
it is too hard a knot for me to untie 
exit
