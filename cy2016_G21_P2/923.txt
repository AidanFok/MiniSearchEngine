midnight is to be up betimes  and  
surgere  thou know st 


sir andrew

nay  my troth  i know not  but i know  to be up
late is to be up late 


sir toby belch

a false conclusion  i hate it as an unfilled can 
to be up after midnight and to go to bed then  is
early  so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
to bed betimes  does not our life consist of the
four elements 


sir andrew

faith  so they say  but i think it rather consists
of eating and drinking 


sir toby belch

but shall we make the welkin dance indeed  shall we
rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three
souls out of one weaver  shall we do that

exit


maria

go shake your ears 


sir andrew

 as good a deed as to drink when a man 
a hungry  to challenge him the field  and then to
break promise with him and make a fool of him 


sir toby belch

do t  knight  i write thee a challenge  or i 
deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth 


maria

sweet sir toby  be patient for tonight  since the
youth of the count was today with thy lady  she is
much out of quiet  for monsieur malvolio  let me
alone with him  if i do not gull him into a
nayword  and make him a common recreation  do not
think i have wit enough to lie straight in my bed 
i know i can do it 


sir toby belch

possess us  possess us  tell us something of him 


maria

sir andrew

o  if i thought that i beat him like a dog 


sir toby belch

what  for being a puritan  thy exquisite reason 
dear knight 


sir andrew

i have no exquisite reason for t  but i have reason
good enough 


maria

the devil a puritan that he is  or any thing
constantly  but a time pleaser  an affectioned ass 
that cons state without book and utters it by great
swarths  the best persuaded of himself  so
crammed  as he thinks  with excellencies  that it is
his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
him  and on that vice in him will my revenge find
notable cause to work 


sir toby belch

what wilt thou do 


maria

i will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
love  wherein  by the colour of his beard  the shape
of his leg  the manner of his gait  the expressure
of his eye  forehead  and complexion  he shall find
himself most feelingly personated  i can write very
like my lady your niece  on a forgotten matter we
can hardly make distinction of our hands 


sir toby belch

excellent  i smell a device 


sir andrew

i have in my nose too 


sir toby belch

he shall think  by the letters that thou wilt drop 
that they come from my niece  and that she in
love with him 


maria

my purpose is  indeed  a horse of that colour 


sir andrew

and your horse now would make him an ass 


maria

ass  i doubt not 


sir andrew

o   be admirable 


maria

sport royal  i warrant you  i know my physic will
work with him  i will plant you two  and let the
fool make a third  where he shall find the letter 
observe his construction of it  for this night  to
bed  and dream on the event  farewell 
exit


sir toby belch
