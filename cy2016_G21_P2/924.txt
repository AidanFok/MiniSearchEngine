scene iv  duke orsino palace 


enter duke orsino  viola  curio  and others


duke orsino

give me some music  now  good morrow  friends 
now  good cesario  but that piece of song 
that old and antique song we heard last night 
methought it did relieve my passion much 
more than light airs and recollected terms
of these most brisk and giddy paced times 
come  but one verse 


curio

he is not here  so please your lordship that should sing it 


duke orsino

who was it 


curio

feste  the jester  my lord  a fool that the lady
olivia father took much delight in  he is about the house 


duke orsino

seek him out  and play the tune the while 
exit curio  music plays
come hither  boy  if ever thou shalt love 
in the sweet pangs of it remember me 
for such as i am all true lovers are 
unstaid and skittish in all motions else 
save in the constant image of the creature
that is beloved  how dost thou like this tune 


viola

it gives a very echo to the seat
where love is throned 


duke orsino

thou dost speak masterly 
my life upon t  young though thou art  thine eye
hath stay upon some favour that it loves 
hath it not  boy 


viola

                  a little  by your favour 


duke orsino

what kind of woman is t 


viola

of your complexion 


duke orsino

she is not worth thee  then  what years  i  faith 


viola

about your years  my lord 


duke orsino

too old by heaven  let still the woman take
an elder than herself  so wears she to him 
so sways she level in her husband heart 
for  boy  however we do praise ourselves 
our fancies are more giddy and unfirm 
more longing  wavering  sooner lost and worn 
than women are 


viola

                  i think it well  my lord 


duke orsino

then let thy love be younger than thyself 
or thy affection cannot hold the bent 
for women are as roses  whose fair flower
being once display d  doth fall that very hour 


viola

and so they are  alas  that they are so 
to die  even when they to perfection grow 
re enter curio and clown


duke orsino

o  fellow  come  the song we had last night 
mark it  cesario  it is old and plain 
the spinsters and the knitters in the sun
and the free maids that weave their thread with bones
do use to chant it  it is silly sooth 
and dallies with the innocence of love 
like the old age 


clown

are you ready  sir 


duke orsino

ay  prithee  sing 
music
song 


clown

come away  come away  death 
and in sad cypress let me be laid 
fly away  fly away breath 
i am slain by a fair cruel maid 
my shroud of white  stuck all with yew 
o  prepare it 
my part of death  no one so true
did share it 
not a flower  not a flower sweet
on my black coffin let there be strown 
not a friend  not a friend greet
my poor corpse  where my bones shall be thrown 
a thousand thousand sighs to save 
lay me  o  where
sad true lover never find my grave 
to weep there 


duke orsino

there for thy pains 


clown

no pains  sir  i take pleasure in singing  sir 


duke orsino

i pay thy pleasure then 


clown

truly  sir  and pleasure will be paid  one time or another 


duke orsino

give me now leave to leave thee 


clown

now  the melancholy god protect thee  and the
tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta  for
thy mind is a very opal  i would have men of such
constancy put to sea  that their business might be
every thing and their intent every where  for that 
it that always makes a good voyage of nothing  farewell 
exit


duke orsino

let all the rest give place 
curio and attendants retire
once more  cesario 
get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty 
tell her  my love  more noble than the world 
prizes not quantity of dirty lands 
the parts that fortune hath bestow upon her 
tell her  i hold as giddily as fortune 
but  that miracle and queen of gems
that nature pranks her in attracts my soul 


viola

but if she cannot love you  sir 


duke orsino

i cannot be so answer d 


viola

sooth  but you must 
say that some lady  as perhaps there is 
hath for your love a great a pang of heart
as you have for olivia  you cannot love her 
you tell her so  must she not then be answer d 


duke orsino

there is no woman sides
can bide the beating of so strong a passion
as love doth give my heart  no woman heart
so big  to hold so much  they lack retention
alas  their love may be call appetite 
no motion of the liver  but the palate 
that suffer surfeit  cloyment and revolt 
but mine is all as hungry as the sea 
and can digest as much  make no compare
between that love a woman can bear me
and that i owe olivia 


viola

ay  but i know 


duke orsino

what dost thou know 


viola

too well what love women to men may owe 
in faith  they are as true of heart as we 
my father had a daughter loved a man 
as it might be  perhaps  were i a woman 
i should your lordship 


duke orsino

and what her history 


viola

a blank  my lord  she never told her love 
but let concealment  like a worm i  the bud 
feed on her damask cheek  she pined in thought 
and with a green and yellow melancholy
she sat like patience on a monument 
smiling at grief  was not this love indeed 
we men may say more  swear more  but indeed
our shows are more than will  for still we prove
much in our vows  but little in our love 


duke orsino

but died thy sister of her love  my boy 


viola

i am all the daughters of my father house 
and all the brothers too  and yet i know not 
sir  shall i to this lady 


duke orsino

ay  that the theme 
to her in haste  give her this jewel  say 
my love can give no place  bide no denay 
exeunt
