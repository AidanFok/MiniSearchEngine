sir toby belch

wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
rascally sheep biter come by some notable shame 


fabian

i would exult  man  you know  he brought me out o 
favour with my lady about a bear baiting here

coming down this walk  he has been yonder i  the
sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
hour  observe him  for the love of mockery  for i
know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
him  close  in the name of jesting  lie thou there 
throws down a letter
for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling 
exit
enter malvolio


malvolio

 but fortune  all is fortune  maria once told
me she did affect me  and i have heard herself come
thus near  that  should she fancy  it should be one
of my complexion  besides  she uses me with a more
exalted respect than any one else that follows her 
what should i think on t 


sir toby belch

here an overweening rogue 


fabian

o  peace  contemplation makes a rare turkey cock
of him  how he jets under his advanced plumes 


sir andrew

 slight  i could so beat the rogue 


sir toby belch

peace  i say 


malvolio

to be count malvolio 


sir toby belch

ah  rogue

married the yeoman of the wardrobe 


sir andrew

fie on him  jezebel 


fabian

o  peace  now he deeply in  look how
imagination blows him 


malvolio

having been three months married to her  sitting in
my state 


sir toby belch

o  for a stone bow  to hit him in the eye 


malvolio

calling my officers about me  in my branched velvet
gown  having come from a day bed  where i have left
olivia sleeping 


sir toby belch

fire and brimstone 


fabian

o  peace  peace 


malvolio

and then to have the humour of state  and after a
demure travel of regard  telling them i know my
place as i would they should do theirs  to for my
kinsman toby 


sir toby belch

bolts and shackles 


fabian

o peace  peace  peace  now  now 


malvolio

seven of my people  with an obedient start  make
out for him  i frown the while  and perchance wind
up watch  or play with my some rich jewel  toby
approaches  courtesies there to me 


sir toby belch

shall this fellow live 


fabian

though our silence be drawn from us with cars  yet peace 


malvolio

i extend my hand to him thus  quenching my familiar
smile with an austere regard of control 


sir toby belch

and does not toby take you a blow o  the lips then 


malvolio

saying   toby  my fortunes having cast me on
your niece give me this prerogative of speech 


sir toby belch

what  what 


malvolio

 must amend your drunkenness 


sir toby belch

out  scab 


fabian

nay  patience  or we break the sinews of our plot 


malvolio

 besides  you waste the treasure of your time with
a foolish knight 


sir andrew

that me  i warrant you 


malvolio

 sir andrew 


sir andrew

i knew  i  for many do call me fool 


malvolio

what employment have we here 
taking up the letter


fabian

now is the woodcock near the gin 


sir toby belch

o  peace  and the spirit of humour intimate reading
aloud to him 


malvolio

by my life  this is my lady hand these be her
very c s  her u and her t and thus makes she her
great p s  it is  in contempt of question  her hand 


sir andrew

her c s  her u and her t s  why that 


malvolio

 reads    the unknown beloved  this  and my good
wishes her very phrases  by your leave  wax 
soft  and the impressure her lucrece  with which she
uses to seal   my lady  to whom should this be 


fabian

this wins him  liver and all 


malvolio

 reads 
jove knows i love  but who 
lips  do not move 
no man must know 
 man must know  what follows  the numbers
altered   man must know  if this should be
thee  malvolio 


sir toby belch

marry  hang thee  brock 


malvolio

 reads 
i may command where i adore 
but silence  like a lucrece knife 
with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore 
m  o  a  i  doth sway my life 


fabian

a fustian riddle 


sir toby belch

excellent wench  say i 


malvolio

 m  o  a  i  doth sway my life  nay  but first  let
me see  let me see  let me see 


fabian

what dish o  poison has she dressed him 


sir toby belch

and with what wing the staniel cheques at it 


malvolio

 may command where i adore  why  she may command
me  i serve her  she is my lady  why  this is
evident to any formal capacity  there is no
obstruction in this  and the end what should
that alphabetical position portend  if i could make
that resemble something in me softly  m  o  a 
i 


sir toby belch

o  ay  make up that  he is now at a cold scent 


fabian

sowter will cry upon for all this  though it be as
rank as a fox 


malvolio

m malvolio  m why  that begins my name 


fabian

did not i say he would work it out  the cur is
excellent at faults 


malvolio

m but then there is no consonancy in the sequel 
that suffers under probation a should follow but o does 


fabian

and o shall end  i hope 


sir toby belch

ay  or i cudgel him  and make him cry o 


malvolio

and then i comes behind 


fabian

ay  an you had any eye behind you  you might see
more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
you 


malvolio

m  o  a  i  this simulation is not as the former  and
yet  to crush this a little  it would bow to me  for
every one of these letters are in my name  soft 
here follows prose 
reads
 this fall into thy hand  revolve  in my stars i
am above thee  but be not afraid of greatness  some
are born great  some achieve greatness  and some
have greatness thrust upon  em  thy fates open
their hands  let thy blood and spirit embrace them 
and  to inure thyself to what thou art like to be 
cast thy humble slough and appear fresh  be
opposite with a kinsman  surly with servants  let
thy tongue tang arguments of state  put thyself into
the trick of singularity  she thus advises thee
that sighs for thee  remember who commended thy
yellow stockings  and wished to see thee ever
cross gartered  i say  remember  go to  thou art
made  if thou desirest to be so  if not  let me see
thee a steward still  the fellow of servants  and
not worthy to touch fortune fingers  farewell 
she that would alter services with thee 
the fortunate unhappy 
daylight and champaign discovers not more  this is
open  i will be proud  i will read politic authors 
i will baffle sir toby  i will wash off gross
acquaintance  i will be point devise the very man 
i do not now fool myself  to let imagination jade
me  for every reason excites to this  that my lady
loves me  she did commend my yellow stockings of
late  she did praise my leg being cross gartered 
and in this she manifests herself to my love  and
with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
of her liking  i thank my stars i am happy  i will
be strange  stout  in yellow stockings  and
cross gartered  even with the swiftness of putting
on  jove and my stars be praised  here is yet a
postscript 
reads
 canst not choose but know who i am  if thou
entertainest my love  let it appear in thy smiling 
thy smiles become thee well  therefore in my
presence still smile  dear my sweet  i prithee 
jove  i thank thee  i will smile  i will do
everything that thou wilt have me 
exit


fabian

i will not give my part of this sport for a pension
of thousands to be paid from the sophy 


sir toby belch

i could marry this wench for this device 


sir andrew

so could i too 


sir toby belch

and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest 


sir andrew

nor i neither 


fabian

here comes my noble gull catcher 
re enter maria


sir toby belch

wilt thou set thy foot o  my neck 


sir andrew

or o  mine either 


sir toby belch

shall i play my freedom at traytrip  and become thy
bond slave 


sir andrew

i  faith  or i either 


sir toby belch

why  thou hast put him in such a dream  that when
the image of it leaves him he must run mad 


maria

nay  but say true  does it work upon him 


sir toby belch

like aqua vitae with a midwife 


maria

if you will then see the fruits of the sport  mark
his first approach before my lady  he will come to
her in yellow stockings  and  a colour she
abhors  and cross gartered  a fashion she detests 
and he will smile upon her  which will now be so
unsuitable to her disposition  being addicted to a
melancholy as she is  that it cannot but turn him
into a notable contempt  if you will see it  follow
me 


sir toby belch

to the gates of tartar  thou most excellent devil of wit 


sir andrew

i make one too
