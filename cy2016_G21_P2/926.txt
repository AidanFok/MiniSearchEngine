scene i  olivia garden 


enter viola  and clown with a tabour


viola

save thee  friend  and thy music  dost thou live by
thy tabour 


clown

no  sir  i live by the church 


viola

art thou a churchman 


clown

no such matter  sir  i do live by the church  for
i do live at my house  and my house doth stand by
the church 


viola

so thou mayst say  the king lies by a beggar  if a
beggar dwell near him  or  the church stands by thy
tabour  if thy tabour stand by the church 


clown

you have said  sir  to see this age  a sentence is
but a cheveril glove to a good wit  how quickly the
wrong side may be turned outward 


viola

nay  that certain  they that dally nicely with
words may quickly make them wanton 


clown

i would  therefore  my sister had had no name  sir 


viola

why  man 


clown

why  sir  her name a word  and to dally with that
word might make my sister wanton  but indeed words
are very rascals since bonds disgraced them 


viola

thy reason  man 


clown

troth  sir  i can yield you none without words  and
words are grown so false  i am loath to prove
reason with them 


viola

i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing 


clown

not so  sir  i do care for something  but in my
conscience  sir  i do not care for you  if that be
to care for nothing  sir  i would it would make you invisible 


viola

art not thou the lady olivia fool 


clown

no  indeed  sir  the lady olivia has no folly  she
will keep no fool  sir  till she be married  and
fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
herrings  the husband the bigger  i am indeed not
her fool  but her corrupter of words 


viola

i saw thee late at the count orsino s 


clown

foolery  sir  does walk about the orb like the sun 
it shines every where  i would be sorry  sir  but
the fool should be as oft with your master as with
my mistress  i think i saw your wisdom there 


viola

nay  an thou pass upon me  i no more with thee 
hold  there expenses for thee 


clown

now jove  in his next commodity of hair  send thee a beard 


viola

by my troth  i tell thee  i am almost sick for
one 
aside
though i would not have it grow on my chin  is thy
lady within 


clown

would not a pair of these have bred  sir 


viola

yes  being kept together and put to use 


clown

i would play lord pandarus of phrygia  sir  to bring
a cressida to this troilus 


viola

i understand you  sir   well begged 


clown

the matter  i hope  is not great  sir  begging but
a beggar  cressida was a beggar  my lady is
within  sir  i will construe to them whence you
come  who you are and what you would are out of my
welkin  i might say  element  but the word is over worn 
exit


viola

this fellow is wise enough to play the fool 
and to do that well craves a kind of wit 
he must observe their mood on whom he jests 
the quality of persons  and the time 
and  like the haggard  cheque at every feather
that comes before his eye  this is a practise
as full of labour as a wise man art
for folly that he wisely shows is fit 
but wise men  folly fall n  quite taint their wit 
enter sir toby belch  and sir andrew


sir toby belch

save you  gentleman 


viola

and you  sir 


sir andrew

dieu vous garde  monsieur 


viola

et vous aussi  votre serviteur 


sir andrew

i hope  sir  you are  and i am yours 


sir toby belch

will you encounter the house  my niece is desirous
you should enter  if your trade be to her 


viola

i am bound to your niece  sir  i mean  she is the
list of my voyage 


sir toby belch

taste your legs  sir  put them to motion 


viola

my legs do better understand me  sir  than i
understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs 


sir toby belch

i mean  to go  sir  to enter 


viola

i will answer you with gait and entrance  but we
are prevented 
enter olivia and maria
most excellent accomplished lady  the heavens rain
odours on you 


sir andrew

that youth a rare courtier   odours  well 


viola

my matter hath no voice  to your own most pregnant
and vouchsafed ear 


sir andrew

 odours   pregnant  and  vouchsafed  i get  
all three all ready 


olivia

let the garden door be shut  and leave me to my hearing 
exeunt sir toby belch  sir andrew  and maria
give me your hand  sir 


viola

my duty  madam  and most humble service 


olivia

what is your name 


viola

cesario is your servant name  fair princess 


olivia

my servant  sir   never merry world
since lowly feigning was call compliment 
you servant to the count orsino  youth 


viola

and he is yours  and his must needs be yours 
your servant servant is your servant  madam 


olivia

for him  i think not on him  for his thoughts 
would they were blanks  rather than fill with me 


viola

madam  i come to whet your gentle thoughts
on his behalf 


olivia

                  o  by your leave  i pray you 
i bade you never speak again of him 
but  would you undertake another suit 
i had rather hear you to solicit that
than music from the spheres 


viola

dear lady 


olivia

give me leave  beseech you  i did send 
after the last enchantment you did here 
a ring in chase of you  so did i abuse
myself  my servant and  i fear me  you 
under your hard construction must i sit 
to force that on you  in a shameful cunning 
which you knew none of yours  what might you think 
have you not set mine honour at the stake
and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
that tyrannous heart can think  to one of your receiving
enough is shown  a cypress  not a bosom 
hideth my heart  so  let me hear you speak 


viola

i pity you 


olivia

          that a degree to love 


viola

no  not a grize  for  a vulgar proof 
that very oft we pity enemies 


olivia

why  then  methinks  time to smile again 
o  world  how apt the poor are to be proud 
if one should be a prey  how much the better
to fall before the lion than the wolf 
clock strikes
the clock upbraids me with the waste of time 
be not afraid  good youth  i will not have you 
and yet  when wit and youth is come to harvest 
your were is alike to reap a proper man 
there lies your way  due west 


viola

then westward ho  grace and good disposition
attend your ladyship 
you nothing  madam  to my lord by me 


olivia

stay 
i prithee  tell me what thou thinkest of me 


viola

that you do think you are not what you are 


olivia

if i think so  i think the same of you 


viola

then think you right  i am not what i am 


olivia

i would you were as i would have you be 


viola

would it be better  madam  than i am 
i wish it might  for now i am your fool 


olivia

o  what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
in the contempt and anger of his lip 
a murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
than love that would seem hid  love night is noon 
cesario  by the roses of the spring 
by maidhood  honour  truth and every thing 
i love thee so  that  maugre all thy pride 
nor wit nor reason can my passion hide 
do not extort thy reasons from this clause 
for that i woo  thou therefore hast no cause 
but rather reason thus with reason fetter 
love sought is good  but given unsought better 


viola

by innocence i swear  and by my youth
i have one heart  one bosom and one truth 
and that no woman has  nor never none
shall mistress be of it  save i alone 
and so adieu  good madam  never more
will i my master tears to you deplore 


olivia

yet come again  for thou perhaps mayst move
that heart  which now abhors  to like his love 
exeunt
