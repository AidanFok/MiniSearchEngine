scene ii  olivia house 


enter sir toby belch  sir andrew  and fabian


sir andrew

no  faith  i not stay a jot longer 


sir toby belch

thy reason  dear venom  give thy reason 


fabian

you must needs yield your reason  sir andrew 


sir andrew

marry  i saw your niece do more favours to the
count serving man than ever she bestowed upon me 
i saw i  the orchard 


sir toby belch

did she see thee the while  old boy  tell me that 


sir andrew

as plain as i see you now 


fabian

this was a great argument of love in her toward you 


sir andrew

 slight  will you make an ass o  me 


fabian

i will prove it legitimate  sir  upon the oaths of
judgment and reason 


sir toby belch

and they have been grand jury men since before noah
was a sailor 


fabian

she did show favour to the youth in your sight only
to exasperate you  to awake your dormouse valour  to
put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver 
you should then have accosted her  and with some
excellent jests  fire new from the mint  you should
have banged the youth into dumbness  this was
looked for at your hand  and this was balked  the
double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
off  and you are now sailed into the north of my
lady opinion  where you will hang like an icicle
on a dutchman beard  unless you do redeem it by
some laudable attempt either of valour or policy 


sir andrew

an be any way  it must be with valour  for policy
i hate  i had as lief be a brownist as a
politician 


sir toby belch

why  then  build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
valour  challenge me the count youth to fight
with him  hurt him in eleven places  my niece shall
take note of it  and assure thyself  there is no
love broker in the world can more prevail in man 
commendation with woman than report of valour 


fabian

there is no way but this  sir andrew 


sir andrew

will either of you bear me a challenge to him 


sir toby belch

go  write it in a martial hand  be curst and brief 
it is no matter how witty  so it be eloquent and fun
of invention  taunt him with the licence of ink 
if thou thou him some thrice  it shall not be
amiss  and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
paper  although the sheet were big enough for the
bed of ware in england  set  down  go  about it 
let there be gall enough in thy ink  though thou
write with a goose pen  no matter  about it 


sir andrew

where shall i find you 


sir toby belch

we call thee at the cubiculo  go 
exit sir andrew


fabian

this is a dear manikin to you  sir toby 


sir toby belch

i have been dear to him  lad  some two thousand
strong  or so 


fabian

we shall have a rare letter from him  but you 
not deliver t 


sir toby belch

never trust me  then  and by all means stir on the
youth to an answer  i think oxen and wainropes
cannot hale them together  for andrew  if he were
opened  and you find so much blood in his liver as
will clog the foot of a flea  i eat the rest of
the anatomy 


fabian

and his opposite  the youth  bears in his visage no
great presage of cruelty 
enter maria


sir toby belch

look  where the youngest wren of nine comes 


maria

if you desire the spleen  and will laugh yourself
into stitches  follow me  yond gull malvolio is
turned heathen  a very renegado  for there is no
christian  that means to be saved by believing
rightly  can ever believe such impossible passages
of grossness  he in yellow stockings 


sir toby belch

and cross gartered 


maria

most villanously  like a pedant that keeps a school
i  the church  i have dogged him  like his
murderer  he does obey every point of the letter
that i dropped to betray him  he does smile his
face into more lines than is in the new map with the
augmentation of the indies  you have not seen such
a thing as  tis  i can hardly forbear hurling things
at him  i know my lady will strike him  if she do 
he smile and take for a great favour 


sir toby belch

come  bring us  bring us where he is 
exeunt
