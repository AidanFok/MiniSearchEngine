scene iii  a street 


enter sebastian and antonio


sebastian

i would not by my will have troubled you 
but  since you make your pleasure of your pains 
i will no further chide you 


antonio

i could not stay behind you  my desire 
more sharp than filed steel  did spur me forth 
and not all love to see you  though so much
as might have drawn one to a longer voyage 
but jealousy what might befall your travel 
being skilless in these parts  which to a stranger 
unguided and unfriended  often prove
rough and unhospitable  my willing love 
the rather by these arguments of fear 
set forth in your pursuit 


sebastian

my kind antonio 
i can no other answer make but thanks 
and thanks  and ever             oft good turns
are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay 
but  were my worth as is my conscience firm 
you should find better dealing  what to do 
shall we go see the reliques of this town 


antonio

to morrow  sir  best first go see your lodging 


sebastian

i am not weary  and  long to night 
i pray you  let us satisfy our eyes
with the memorials and the things of fame
that do renown this city 


antonio

would you pardon me 
i do not without danger walk these streets 
once  in a sea fight   the count his galleys
i did some service  of such note indeed 
that were i ta here it would scarce be answer d 


sebastian

belike you slew great number of his people 


antonio

the offence is not of such a bloody nature 
albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
might well have given us bloody argument 
it might have since been answer in repaying
what we took from them  which  for traffic sake 
most of our city did  only myself stood out 
for which  if i be lapsed in this place 
i shall pay dear 


sebastian

                  do not then walk too open 


antonio

it doth not fit me  hold  sir  here my purse 
in the south suburbs  at the elephant 
is best to lodge  i will bespeak our diet 
whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
with viewing of the town  there shall you have me 


sebastian

why i your purse 


antonio

haply your eye shall light upon some toy
you have desire to purchase  and your store 
i think  is not for idle markets  sir 


sebastian

i be your purse bearer and leave you
for an hour 


antonio

to the elephant 


sebastian

                  i do remember 
exeunt
