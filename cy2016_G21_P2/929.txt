appear stubborn to him  for she incites me to that
in the letter   thy humble slough  says she 
 opposite with a kinsman  surly with servants 
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state  put
thyself into the trick of singularity  and
consequently sets down the manner how  as  a sad
face  a reverend carriage  a slow tongue  in the
habit of some sir of note  and so forth  i have
limed her  but it is jove doing  and jove make me
thankful  and when she went away now   this
fellow be looked to  fellow  not malvolio  nor
after my degree  but fellow  why  every thing
adheres together  that no dram of a scruple  no
scruple of a scruple  no obstacle  no incredulous
or unsafe circumstance what can be said  nothing
that can be can come between me and the full
prospect of my hopes  well  jove  not i  is the
doer of this  and he is to be thanked

more hereafter 
exit


sir toby belch

is possible 


fabian

if this were played upon a stage now  i could
condemn it as an improbable fiction 


sir toby belch

his very genius hath taken the infection of the device  man 


maria

nay  pursue him now  lest the device take air and taint 


fabian

why  we shall make him mad indeed 


maria

the house will be the quieter 


sir toby belch

come  we have him in a dark room and bound  my
niece is already in the belief that he mad  we
may carry it thus  for our pleasure and his penance 
till our very pastime  tired out of breath  prompt
us to have mercy on him  at which time we will
bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
finder of madmen  but see  but see 
enter sir andrew


fabian

more matter for a may morning 


sir andrew

here the challenge  read it  warrant there 
vinegar and pepper in t 


fabian

is so saucy 


sir andrew

ay  is t  i warrant him  do but read 


sir toby belch

give me 
reads
 youth  whatsoever thou art  thou art but a scurvy fellow 


fabian

good  and valiant 


sir toby belch

 reads    not  nor admire not in thy mind 
why i do call thee so  for i will show thee no reason for t 


fabian

a good note  that keeps you from the blow of the law 


sir toby belch

 reads    comest to the lady olivia  and in my
sight she uses thee kindly  but thou liest in thy
throat  that is not the matter i challenge thee for 


fabian

very brief  and to exceeding good sense less 


sir toby belch

 reads    will waylay thee going home  where if it
be thy chance to kill me 


fabian

good 


sir toby belch

 reads    killest me like a rogue and a villain 


fabian

still you keep o  the windy side of the law  good 


sir toby belch

 reads    thee well  and god have mercy upon
one of our souls  he may have mercy upon mine  but
my hope is better  and so look to thyself  thy
friend  as thou usest him  and thy sworn enemy 
andrew aguecheek 
if this letter move him not  his legs cannot 
i give him 


maria

you may have very fit occasion for t  he is now in
some commerce with my lady  and will by and by depart 


sir toby belch

go  sir andrew  scout me for him at the corner the
orchard like a bum baily  so soon as ever thou seest
him  draw  and  as thou drawest swear horrible  for
it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath  with a
swaggering accent sharply twanged off  gives manhood
more approbation than ever proof itself would have
earned him  away 


sir andrew

nay  let me alone for swearing 
exit


sir toby belch

now will not i deliver his letter  for the behavior
of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
capacity and breeding  his employment between his
lord and my niece confirms no less  therefore this
letter  being so excellently ignorant  will breed no
terror in the youth  he will find it comes from a
clodpole  but  sir  i will deliver his challenge by
word of mouth  set upon aguecheek a notable report
of valour  and drive the gentleman  as i know his
youth will aptly receive it  into a most hideous
opinion of his rage  skill  fury and impetuosity 
this will so fright them both that they will kill
one another by the look  like cockatrices 
re enter olivia  with viola


fabian

here he comes with your niece  give them way till
he take leave  and presently after him 


sir toby belch

i will meditate the while upon some horrid message
for a challenge 
exeunt sir toby belch  fabian  and maria


olivia

i have said too much unto a heart of stone
and laid mine honour too unchary out 
there something in me that reproves my fault 
but such a headstrong potent fault it is 
that it but mocks reproof 


viola

with the same  that your passion bears
goes on my master grief 


olivia

here  wear this jewel for me   my picture 
refuse it not  it hath no tongue to vex you 
and i beseech you come again to morrow 
what shall you ask of me that i deny 
that honour saved may upon asking give 


viola

nothing but this  your true love for my master 


olivia

how with mine honour may i give him that
which i have given to you 


viola

i will acquit you 


olivia

well  come again to morrow  fare thee well 
a fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell 
exit
re enter sir toby belch and fabian


sir toby belch

gentleman  god save thee 


viola

and you  sir 


sir toby belch

that defence thou hast  betake thee to t  of what
nature the wrongs are thou hast done him  i know
not  but thy intercepter  full of despite  bloody as
the hunter  attends thee at the orchard end 
dismount thy tuck  be yare in thy preparation  for
thy assailant is quick  skilful and deadly 


viola

you mistake  sir  i am sure no man hath any quarrel
to me  my remembrance is very free and clear from
any image of offence done to any man 


sir toby belch

you find it otherwise  i assure you  therefore 
if you hold your life at any price  betake you to
your guard  for your opposite hath in him what
youth  strength  skill and wrath can furnish man withal 


viola

i pray you  sir  what is he 


sir toby belch

he is knight  dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
carpet consideration  but he is a devil in private
brawl  souls and bodies hath he divorced three  and
his incensement at this moment is so implacable 
that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
and sepulchre  hob  nob  is his word  give or take t 


viola

i will return again into the house and desire some
conduct of the lady  i am no fighter  i have heard
of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
others  to taste their valour  belike this is a man
of that quirk 


sir toby belch

sir  no  his indignation derives itself out of a
very competent injury  therefore  get you on and
give him his desire  back you shall not to the
house  unless you undertake that with me which with
as much safety you might answer him  therefore  on 
or strip your sword stark naked  for meddle you
must  that certain  or forswear to wear iron about you 


viola

this is as uncivil as strange  i beseech you  do me
this courteous office  as to know of the knight what
my offence to him is  it is something of my
negligence  nothing of my purpose 


sir toby belch

i will do so  signior fabian  stay you by this
gentleman till my return 
exit


viola

pray you  sir  do you know of this matter 


fabian

i know the knight is incensed against you  even to a
mortal arbitrement  but nothing of the circumstance more 


viola

i beseech you  what manner of man is he 


fabian

nothing of that wonderful promise  to read him by
his form  as you are like to find him in the proof
of his valour  he is  indeed  sir  the most skilful 
bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
have found in any part of illyria  will you walk
towards him  i will make your peace with him if i
can 


viola

i shall be much bound to you for t  i am one that
had rather go with sir priest than sir knight  i
care not who knows so much of my mettle 
exeunt
re enter sir toby belch  with sir andrew


sir toby belch

why  man  he a very devil  i have not seen such a
firago  i had a pass with him  rapier  scabbard and
all  and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
motion  that it is inevitable  and on the answer  he
pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
step on  they say he has been fencer to the sophy 


sir andrew

pox on t  i not meddle with him 


sir toby belch

ay  but he will not now be pacified  fabian can
scarce hold him yonder 


sir andrew

plague on t  an i thought he had been valiant and so
cunning in fence  i have seen him damned ere i 
have challenged him  let him let the matter slip 
and i give him my horse  grey capilet 


sir toby belch

i make the motion  stand here  make a good show
on t  this shall end without the perdition of souls 
aside
marry  i ride your horse as well as i ride you 
re enter fabian and viola
to fabian
i have his horse to take up the quarrel 
i have persuaded him the youth a devil 


fabian

he is as horribly conceited of him  and pants and
looks pale  as if a bear were at his heels 


sir toby belch

 to viola   there no remedy  sir  he will fight
with you for oath sake  marry  he hath better
bethought him of his quarrel  and he finds that now
scarce to be worth talking of  therefore draw  for
the supportance of his vow  he protests he will not hurt you 


viola

 aside   pray god defend me  a little thing would
make me tell them how much i lack of a man 


fabian

give ground  if you see him furious 


sir toby belch

come  sir andrew  there no remedy  the gentleman
will  for his honour sake  have one bout with you 
he cannot by the duello avoid it  but he has
promised me  as he is a gentleman and a soldier  he
will not hurt you  come on  to t

have done offence  i take the fault on me 
if you offend him  i for him defy you 


sir toby belch

you  sir  why  what are you 


antonio

one  sir  that for his love dares yet do more
than you have heard him brag to you he will 


sir toby belch

nay  if you be an undertaker  i am for you 
they draw

and reins well 


first officer

this is the man  do thy office 


second officer

antonio  i arrest thee at the suit of count orsino 


antonio

you do mistake me  sir 


first officer

no  sir  no jot  i know your favour well 
though now you have no sea cap on your head 
take him away  he knows i know him well 


antonio

i must obey 
to viola
this comes with seeking you 
but there no remedy  i shall answer it 
what will you do  now my necessity
makes me to ask you for my purse  it grieves me
much more for what i cannot do for you
than what befalls myself  you stand amazed 
but be of comfort 


second officer

come  sir  away 


antonio

i must entreat of you some of that money 


viola

what money  sir 
for the fair kindness you have show me here 
and  part  being prompted by your present trouble 
out of my lean and low ability
i lend you something  my having is not much 
i make division of my present with you 
hold  there half my coffer 


antonio

will you deny me now 
is possible that my deserts to you
can lack persuasion  do not tempt my misery 
lest that it make me so unsound a man
as to upbraid you with those kindnesses
that i have done for you 


viola

i know of none 
nor know i you by voice or any feature 
i hate ingratitude more in a man
than lying  vainness  babbling  drunkenness 
or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
inhabits our frail blood 


antonio

o heavens themselves 


second officer

come  sir  i pray you  go 


antonio

let me speak a little  this youth that you see here
i snatch one half out of the jaws of death 
relieved him with such sanctity of love 
and to his image  which methought did promise
most venerable worth  did i devotion 


first officer

what that to us  the time goes by  away 


antonio

but o how vile an idol proves this god
thou hast  sebastian  done good feature shame 
in nature there no blemish but the mind 
none can be call deform but the unkind 
virtue is beauty  but the beauteous evil
are empty trunks o erflourish by the devil 


first officer

the man grows mad  away with him  come  come  sir 


antonio

lead me on 
exit with officers


viola

methinks his words do from such passion fly 
that he believes himself  so do not i 
prove true  imagination  o  prove true 
that i  dear brother  be now ta for you 


sir toby belch

come hither  knight  come hither  fabian  we 
whisper o a couplet or two of most sage saws 


viola

he named sebastian  i my brother know
yet living in my glass  even such and so
in favour was my brother  and he went
still in this fashion  colour  ornament 
for him i imitate  o  if it prove 
tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love 
exit


sir toby belch

a very dishonest paltry boy  and more a coward than
a hare  his dishonesty appears in leaving his
friend here in necessity and denying him  and for
his cowardship  ask fabian 


fabian

a coward  a most devout coward  religious in it 


sir andrew

 slid  i after him again and beat him 


sir toby belch

do  cuff him soundly  but never draw thy sword 


sir andrew

an i do not 


fabian

come  let see the event 


sir toby belch

i dare lay any money  be nothing yet
