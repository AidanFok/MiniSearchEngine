scene i  a plain near mortimer cross in herefordshire 


a march  enter edward  richard  and their power


edward

i wonder how our princely father  scaped 
or whether he be  away or no
from clifford and northumberland pursuit 
had he been ta en  we should have heard the news 
had he been slain  we should have heard the news 
or had he  scaped  methinks we should have heard
the happy tidings of his good escape 
how fares my brother  why is he so sad 


richard

i cannot joy  until i be resolved
where our right valiant father is become 
i saw him in the battle range about 
and watch him how he singled clifford forth 
methought he bore him in the thickest troop
as doth a lion in a herd of neat 
or as a bear  encompass round with dogs 
who having pinch a few and made them cry 
the rest stand all aloof  and bark at him 
so fared our father with his enemies 
so fled his enemies my warlike father 
methinks   prize enough to be his son 
see how the morning opes her golden gates 
and takes her farewell of the glorious sun 
how well resembles it the prime of youth 
trimm like a younker prancing to his love 


edward

dazzle mine eyes  or do i see three suns 


richard

three glorious suns  each one a perfect sun 
not separated with the racking clouds 
but sever in a pale clear shining sky 
see  see  they join  embrace  and seem to kiss 
as if they vow some league inviolable 
now are they but one lamp  one light  one sun 
in this the heaven figures some event 


edward

 wondrous strange  the like yet never heard of 
i think it cites us  brother  to the field 
that we  the sons of brave plantagenet 
each one already blazing by our meeds 
should notwithstanding join our lights together
and over shine the earth as this the world 
whate it bodes  henceforward will i bear
upon my target three fair shining suns 


richard

nay  bear three daughters  by your leave i speak it 
you love the breeder better than the male 
enter a messenger
but what art thou  whose heavy looks foretell
some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue 


messenger

ah  one that was a woful looker on
when as the noble duke of york was slain 
your princely father and my loving lord 


edward

o  speak no more  for i have heard too much 


richard

say how he died  for i will hear it all 


messenger

environed he was with many foes 
and stood against them  as the hope of troy
against the greeks that would have enter troy 
but hercules himself must yield to odds 
and many strokes  though with a little axe 
hew down and fell the hardest timber oak 
by many hands your father was subdued 
but only slaughter by the ireful arm
of unrelenting clifford and the queen 
who crown the gracious duke in high despite 
laugh in his face  and when with grief he wept 
the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
a napkin steeped in the harmless blood
of sweet young rutland  by rough clifford slain 
and after many scorns  many foul taunts 
they took his head  and on the gates of york
they set the same  and there it doth remain 
the saddest spectacle that e i view d 


edward

sweet duke of york  our prop to lean upon 
now thou art gone  we have no staff  no stay 
o clifford  boisterous clifford  thou hast slain
the flower of europe for his chivalry 
and treacherously hast thou vanquish him 
for hand to hand he would have vanquish thee 
now my soul palace is become a prison 
ah  would she break from hence  that this my body
might in the ground be closed up in rest 
for never henceforth shall i joy again 
never  o never shall i see more joy 


richard

 i cannot weep  for all my body moisture
scarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart 
nor can my tongue unload my heart great burthen 
for selfsame wind that i should speak withal
is kindling coals that fires all my breast 
and burns me up with flames that tears would quench 
to weep is to make less the depth of grief 
tears then for babes  blows and revenge for me
richard  i bear thy name  i venge thy death 
or die renowned by attempting it 


edward

his name that valiant duke hath left with thee 
his dukedom and his chair with me is left 


richard

nay  if thou be that princely eagle bird 
show thy descent by gazing  the sun 
for chair and dukedom  throne and kingdom say 
either that is thine  or else thou wert not his 
march  enter warwick  montague  and their army


warwick

how now  fair lords  what fare  what news abroad 


richard

great lord of warwick  if we should recount
our baleful news  and at each word deliverance
stab poniards in our flesh till all were told 
the words would add more anguish than the wounds 
o valiant lord  the duke of york is slain 


edward

o warwick  warwick  that plantagenet 
which held three dearly as his soul redemption 
is by the stern lord clifford done to death 


warwick

ten days ago i drown these news in tears 
and now  to add more measure to your woes 
i come to tell you things sith then befall n 
after the bloody fray at wakefield fought 
where your brave father breathed his latest gasp 
tidings  as swiftly as the posts could run 
were brought me of your loss and his depart 
i  then in london keeper of the king 
muster my soldiers  gather flocks of friends 
and very well appointed  as i thought 
march toward saint alban to intercept the queen 
bearing the king in my behalf along 
for by my scouts i was advertised
that she was coming with a full intent
to dash our late decree in parliament
touching king henry oath and your succession 
short tale to make  we at saint alban met
our battles join d  and both sides fiercely fought 
but whether  the coldness of the king 
who look full gently on his warlike queen 
that robb my soldiers of their heated spleen 
or whether  report of her success 
or more than common fear of clifford rigour 
who thunders to his captives blood and death 
i cannot judge  but to conclude with truth 
their weapons like to lightning came and went 
our soldiers  like the night owl lazy flight 
or like an idle thresher with a flail 
fell gently down  as if they struck their friends 
i cheer them up with justice of our cause 
with promise of high pay and great rewards 
but all in vain  they had no heart to fight 
and we in them no hope to win the day 
so that we fled  the king unto the queen 
lord george your brother  norfolk and myself 
in haste  post haste  are come to join with you 
for in the marches here we heard you were 
making another head to fight again 


edward

where is the duke of norfolk  gentle warwick 
and when came george from burgundy to england 


warwick

some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers 
and for your brother  he was lately sent
from your kind aunt  duchess of burgundy 
with aid of soldiers to this needful war 


richard

 odds  belike  when valiant warwick fled 
oft have i heard his praises in pursuit 
but ne till now his scandal of retire 


warwick

nor now my scandal  richard  dost thou hear 
for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
can pluck the diadem from faint henry head 
and wring the awful sceptre from his fist 
were he as famous and as bold in war
as he is famed for mildness  peace  and prayer 


richard

i know it well  lord warwick  blame me not 
 love i bear thy glories makes me speak 
but in this troublous time what to be done 
shall we go throw away our coats of steel 
and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns 
numbering our ave maries with our beads 
or shall we on the helmets of our foes
tell our devotion with revengeful arms 
if for the last  say ay  and to it  lords 


warwick

why  therefore warwick came to seek you out 
and therefore comes my brother montague 
attend me  lords  the proud insulting queen 
with clifford and the haught northumberland 
and of their feather many more proud birds 
have wrought the easy melting king like wax 
he swore consent to your succession 
his oath enrolled in the parliament 
and now to london all the crew are gone 
to frustrate both his oath and what beside
may make against the house of lancaster 
their power  i think  is thirty thousand strong 
now  if the help of norfolk and myself 
with all the friends that thou  brave earl of march 
amongst the loving welshmen canst procure 
will but amount to five and twenty thousand 
why  via  to london will we march amain 
and once again bestride our foaming steeds 
and once again cry  upon our foes 
but never once again turn back and fly 


richard

ay  now methinks i hear great warwick speak 
ne may he live to see a sunshine day 
that cries  retire  if warwick bid him stay 


edward

lord warwick  on thy shoulder will i lean 
and when thou fail st as god forbid the hour 
must edward fall  which peril heaven forfend 


warwick

no longer earl of march  but duke of york 
the next degree is england royal throne 
for king of england shalt thou be proclaim 
in every borough as we pass along 
and he that throws not up his cap for joy
shall for the fault make forfeit of his head 
king edward  valiant richard  montague 
stay we no longer  dreaming of renown 
but sound the trumpets  and about our task 


richard

then  clifford  were thy heart as hard as steel 
as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds 
i come to pierce it  or to give thee mine 


edward

then strike up drums  god and saint george for us 
enter a messenger


warwick

how now  what news 


messenger

the duke of norfolk sends you word by me 
the queen is coming with a puissant host 
and craves your company for speedy counsel 


warwick

why then it sorts  brave warriors  let away 
exeunt
