that will use the devil himself with courtesy 
sayest thou that house is dark 


malvolio

as hell  sir topas

why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes 
and the clearstores toward the south north are as
lustrous as ebony  and yet complainest thou of
obstruction

i am not mad  sir topas  i say to you  this house is dark 


clown

madman  thou errest  i say  there is no darkness
but ignorance  in which thou art more puzzled than
the egyptians in their fog

i say  this house is as dark as ignorance  though
ignorance were as dark as hell  and i say  there
was never man thus abused  i am no more mad than you

clown

what thinkest thou of his opinion 


malvolio

i think nobly of the soul  and no way approve his opinion 


clown

fare thee well  remain thou still in darkness 
thou shalt hold the opinion of pythagoras ere i will
allow of thy wits  and fear to kill a woodcock  lest
thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam  fare thee well

gown  he sees thee not 


sir toby belch

to him in thine own voice  and bring me word how
thou findest him  i would we were well rid of this
knavery  if he may be conveniently delivered  i
would he were  for i am now so far in offence with
my niece that i cannot pursue with any safety this
