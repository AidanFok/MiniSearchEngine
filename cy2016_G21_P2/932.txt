this is the air  that is the glorious sun 
this pearl she gave me  i do feel and see t 
and though  wonder that enwraps me thus 
yet  not madness  where antonio  then 
i could not find him at the elephant 
yet there he was  and there i found this credit 
that he did range the town to seek me out 
his counsel now might do me golden service 
for though my soul disputes well with my sense 
that this may be some error  but no madness 
yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
so far exceed all instance  all discourse 
that i am ready to distrust mine eyes
and wrangle with my reason that persuades me
to any other trust but that i am mad
or else the lady mad  yet  if  so 
she could not sway her house  command her followers 
take and give back affairs and their dispatch
with such a smooth  discreet and stable bearing
as i perceive she does  there something in 
that is deceiveable  but here the lady comes 
enter olivia and priest


olivia

blame not this haste of mine  if you mean well 
now go with me and with this holy man
into the chantry by  there  before him 
and underneath that consecrated roof 
plight me the full assurance of your faith 
that my most jealous and too doubtful soul
may live at peace  he shall conceal it
whiles you are willing it shall come to note 
what time we will our celebration keep
according to my birth  what do you say 


sebastian

i follow this good man  and go with you 
and  having sworn truth  ever will be true 


olivia

then lead the way  good father  and heavens so shine 
that they may fairly note this act of mine
