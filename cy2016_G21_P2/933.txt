my foes  sir i profit in the knowledge of myself

exit


viola

here comes the man  sir  that did rescue me 
enter antonio and officers


duke orsino

that face of his i do remember well 
yet  when i saw it last  it was besmear 
as black as vulcan in the smoke of war 
a bawbling vessel was he captain of 
for shallow draught and bulk unprizable 
with which such scathful grapple did he make
with the most noble bottom of our fleet 
that very envy and the tongue of loss
cried fame and honour on him  what the matter 


first officer

orsino  this is that antonio
that took the phoenix and her fraught from candy 
and this is he that did the tiger board 
when your young nephew titus lost his leg 
here in the streets  desperate of shame and state 
in private brabble did we apprehend him 


viola

he did me kindness  sir  drew on my side 
but in conclusion put strange speech upon me 
i know not what  but distraction 


duke orsino

notable pirate  thou salt water thief 
what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies 
whom thou  in terms so bloody and so dear 
hast made thine enemies 


antonio

orsino  noble sir 
be pleased that i shake off these names you give me 
antonio never yet was thief or pirate 
though i confess  on base and ground enough 
orsino enemy  a witchcraft drew me hither 
that most ingrateful boy there by your side 
from the rude sea enraged and foamy mouth
did i redeem  a wreck past hope he was 
his life i gave him and did thereto add
my love  without retention or restraint 
all his in dedication  for his sake
did i expose myself  pure for his love 
into the danger of this adverse town 
drew to defend him when he was beset 
where being apprehended  his false cunning 
not meaning to partake with me in danger 
taught him to face me out of his acquaintance 
and grew a twenty years removed thing
while one would wink  denied me mine own purse 
which i had recommended to his use
not half an hour before 


viola

how can this be 


duke orsino

when came he to this town 


antonio

to day  my lord  and for three months before 
no interim  not a minute vacancy 
both day and night did we keep company 
enter olivia and attendants


duke orsino

here comes the countess  now heaven walks on earth 
but for thee  fellow  fellow  thy words are madness 
three months this youth hath tended upon me 
but more of that anon  take him aside 


olivia

wherein olivia may seem serviceable

viola

olivia

if it be aught to the old tune  my lord 
it is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
as howling after music 


duke orsino

still so cruel 


olivia

still so constant  lord 


duke orsino

what  to perverseness  you uncivil lady 
to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
my soul the faithfull offerings hath breathed out
that e devotion tender d  what shall i do 


olivia

even what it please my lord  that shall become him 


duke orsino

why should i not  had i the heart to do it 
like to the egyptian thief at point of death 
kill what i love a savage jealousy
that sometimes savours nobly  but hear me this 
since you to non regardance cast my faith 
and that i partly know the instrument
that screws me from my true place in your favour 
live you the marble breasted tyrant still 
but this your minion  whom i know you love 
and whom  by heaven i swear  i tender dearly 
him will i tear out of that cruel eye 
where he sits crowned in his master spite 
come  boy  with me  my thoughts are ripe in mischief 
i sacrifice the lamb that i do love 
to spite a raven heart within a dove 


viola

and i  most jocund  apt and willingly 
to do you rest  a thousand deaths would die 


olivia

where goes cesario 


viola

after him i love
more than i love these eyes  more than my life 
more  by all mores  than e i shall love wife 
if i do feign  you witnesses above
punish my life for tainting of my love 


olivia

ay me  detested  how am i beguiled

sebastian

i am sorry  madam  i have hurt your kinsman 
but  had it been the brother of my blood 
i must have done no less with wit and safety 
you throw a strange regard upon me  and by that
i do perceive it hath offended you 
pardon me  sweet one  even for the vows
we made each other but so late ago 


duke orsino

one face  one voice  one habit  and two persons 
a natural perspective  that is and is not 


sebastian

antonio  o my dear antonio 
how have the hours rack and tortured me 
since i have lost thee 


antonio

sebastian are you

an apple  cleft in two  is not more twin
than these two creatures  which is sebastian 


olivia

most wonderful 


sebastian

do i stand there  i never had a brother 
nor can there be that deity in my nature 
of here and every where  i had a sister 
whom the blind waves and surges have devour d 
of charity  what kin are you to me 
what countryman  what name  what parentage 


viola

of messaline  sebastian was my father 
such a sebastian was my brother too 
so went he suited to his watery tomb 
if spirits can assume both form and suit
you come to fright us 


sebastian

a spirit i am indeed 
but am in that dimension grossly clad
which from the womb i did participate 
were you a woman  as the rest goes even 
i should my tears let fall upon your cheek 
and say  thrice welcome  drowned viola 


viola

my father had a mole upon his brow 


sebastian

and so had mine 


viola

and died that day when viola from her birth
had number thirteen years 


sebastian

o  that record is lively in my soul 
he finished indeed his mortal act
that day that made my sister thirteen years 


viola

if nothing lets to make us happy both
but this my masculine usurp attire 
do not embrace me till each circumstance
of place  time  fortune  do cohere and jump
that i am viola  which to confirm 
i bring you to a captain in this town 
where lie my maiden weeds  by whose gentle help
i was preserved to serve this noble count 
all the occurrence of my fortune since
hath been between this lady and this lord 


sebastian

 to olivia   so comes it  lady  you have been mistook 
but nature to her bias drew in that 
you would have been contracted to a maid 
nor are you therein  by my life  deceived 
you are betroth both to a maid and man 


duke orsino

be not amazed  right noble is his blood 
if this be so  as yet the glass seems true 
i shall have share in this most happy wreck 
to viola
boy  thou hast said to me a thousand times
thou never shouldst love woman like to me 


viola

and all those sayings will i overswear 
and those swearings keep as true in soul
as doth that orbed continent the fire
that severs day from night 


duke orsino

give me thy hand 
and let me see thee in thy woman weeds 


viola

the captain that did bring me first on shore
hath my maid garments  he upon some action
is now in durance  at malvolio suit

clown

truly  madam  he holds belzebub at the staves end as
well as a man in his case may do  has here writ a
letter to you  i should have given you to day
morning  but as a madman epistles are no gospels 
so it skills not much when they are delivered

clown

look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
the madman 
reads
 the lord  madam

will have it as it ought to be  you must allow vox 


olivia

prithee  read i  thy right wits 


clown

so i do  madonna  but to read his right wits is to
read thus  therefore perpend  my princess  and give ear 


olivia

read it you  sirrah 
to fabian


fabian

 reads    the lord  madam  you wrong me  and the
world shall know it  though you have put me into
darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
me  yet have i the benefit of my senses as well as
your ladyship  i have your own letter that induced
me to the semblance i put on  with the which i doubt
not but to do myself much right  or you much shame 
think of me as you please  i leave my duty a little
unthought of and speak out of my injury 
the madly used malvolio 


olivia

did he write this

thought on 
to think me as well a sister as a wife 
one day shall crown the alliance on t  so please you 
here at my house and at my proper cost 


duke orsino

madam  i am most apt to embrace your offer 
to viola
your master quits you  and for your service done him 
so much against the mettle of your sex 
so far beneath your soft and tender breeding 
and since you call me master for so long 
here is my hand  you shall from this time be
your master mistress 


olivia

a sister  you are she 
re enter fabian  with malvolio

malvolio

lady  you have  pray you  peruse that letter 
you must not now deny it is your hand 
write from it  if you can  in hand or phrase 
or say  not your seal  nor your invention 
you can say none of this  well  grant it then
and tell me  in the modesty of honour 
why you have given me such clear lights of favour 
bade me come smiling and cross garter to you 
to put on yellow stockings and to frown
upon sir toby and the lighter people 
and  acting this in an obedient hope 
why have you suffer me to be imprison d 
kept in a dark house  visited by the priest 
and made the most notorious geck and gull
that e invention play on  tell me why 


olivia

alas  malvolio  this is not my writing 
though  i confess  much like the character
but out of question  maria hand 
and now i do bethink me  it was she
first told me thou wast mad  then camest in smiling 
and in such forms which here were presupposed
upon thee in the letter  prithee  be content 
this practise hath most shrewdly pass upon thee 
but when we know the grounds and authors of it 
thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
of thine own cause 


fabian

good madam  hear me speak 
and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
taint the condition of this present hour 
which i have wonder at  in hope it shall not 
most freely i confess  myself and toby
set this device against malvolio here 
upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
we had conceived against him  maria writ
the letter at sir toby great importance 
in recompense whereof he hath married her 
how with a sportful malice it was follow d 
may rather pluck on laughter than revenge 
if that the injuries be justly weigh 
that have on both sides pass d 


olivia

alas  poor fool  how have they baffled thee 


clown

why   are born great  some achieve greatness 
and some have greatness thrown upon them  i was
one  sir  in this interlude  one sir topas  sir  but
that all one   the lord  fool  i am not mad 
but do you remember   madam  why laugh you at such
a barren rascal  an you smile not  he gagged 
and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges 


malvolio

i be revenged on the whole pack of you 
exit


olivia

he hath been most notoriously abused 


duke orsino

pursue him and entreat him to a peace 
he hath not told us of the captain yet 
when that is known and golden time convents 
a solemn combination shall be made
of our dear souls  meantime  sweet sister 
we will not part from hence  cesario  come 
for so you shall be  while you are a man 
but when in other habits you are seen 
orsino mistress and his fancy queen 
exeunt all  except clown

with hey  ho  the wind and the rain
