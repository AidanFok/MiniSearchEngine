scene i  verona  an open place 


enter valentine and proteus


valentine

cease to persuade  my loving proteus 
home keeping youth have ever homely wits 
were not affection chains thy tender days
to the sweet glances of thy honour love 
i rather would entreat thy company
to see the wonders of the world abroad 
than  living dully sluggardized at home 
wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness 
but since thou lovest  love still and thrive therein 
even as i would when i to love begin 


proteus

wilt thou be gone  sweet valentine  adieu 
think on thy proteus  when thou haply seest
some rare note worthy object in thy travel 
wish me partaker in thy happiness
when thou dost meet good hap  and in thy danger 
if ever danger do environ thee 
commend thy grievance to my holy prayers 
for i will be thy beadsman  valentine 


valentine

and on a love book pray for my success 


proteus

upon some book i love i pray for thee 


valentine

that on some shallow story of deep love 
how young leander cross the hellespont 


proteus

that a deep story of a deeper love 
for he was more than over shoes in love 


valentine

 true  for you are over boots in love 
and yet you never swum the hellespont 


proteus

over the boots  nay  give me not the boots 


valentine

no  i will not  for it boots thee not 


proteus

what 


valentine

to be in love  where scorn is bought with groans 
coy looks with heart sore sighs  one fading moment mirth
with twenty watchful  weary  tedious nights 
if haply won  perhaps a hapless gain 
if lost  why then a grievous labour won 
however  but a folly bought with wit 
or else a wit by folly vanquished 


proteus

so  by your circumstance  you call me fool 


valentine

so  by your circumstance  i fear you prove 


proteus

 love you cavil at  i am not love 


valentine

love is your master  for he masters you 
and he that is so yoked by a fool 
methinks  should not be chronicled for wise 


proteus

yet writers say  as in the sweetest bud
the eating canker dwells  so eating love
inhabits in the finest wits of all 


valentine

and writers say  as the most forward bud
is eaten by the canker ere it blow 
even so by love the young and tender wit
is turn to folly  blasting in the bud 
losing his verdure even in the prime
and all the fair effects of future hopes 
but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee 
that art a votary to fond desire 
once more adieu  my father at the road
expects my coming  there to see me shipp d 


proteus

and thither will i bring thee  valentine 


valentine

sweet proteus  no  now let us take our leave 
to milan let me hear from thee by letters
of thy success in love  and what news else
betideth here in absence of thy friend 
and likewise will visit thee with mine 


proteus

all happiness bechance to thee in milan 


valentine

as much to you at home  and so  farewell 
exit


proteus

he after honour hunts  i after love 
he leaves his friends to dignify them more 
i leave myself  my friends and all  for love 
thou  julia  thou hast metamorphosed me 
made me neglect my studies  lose my time 
war with good counsel  set the world at nought 
made wit with musing weak  heart sick with thought 
enter speed


speed

sir proteus  save you  saw you my master 


proteus

but now he parted hence  to embark for milan 


speed

twenty to one then he is shipp already 
and i have play the sheep in losing him 


proteus

indeed  a sheep doth very often stray 
an if the shepherd be a while away 


speed

you conclude that my master is a shepherd  then 
and i a sheep 


proteus

i do 


speed

why then  my horns are his horns  whether i wake or sleep 


proteus

a silly answer and fitting well a sheep 


speed

this proves me still a sheep 


proteus

true  and thy master a shepherd 


speed

nay  that i can deny by a circumstance 


proteus

it shall go hard but i prove it by another 


speed

the shepherd seeks the sheep  and not the sheep the
shepherd  but i seek my master  and my master seeks
not me  therefore i am no sheep 


proteus

the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd  the
shepherd for food follows not the sheep  thou for
wages followest thy master  thy master for wages
follows not thee  therefore thou art a sheep 


speed

such another proof will make me cry  baa 


proteus

but  dost thou hear  gavest thou my letter to julia 


speed

ay sir  i  a lost mutton  gave your letter to her 
a laced mutton  and she  a laced mutton  gave me  a
lost mutton  nothing for my labour 


proteus

here too small a pasture for such store of muttons 


speed

if the ground be overcharged  you were best stick her 


proteus

nay  in that you are astray   best pound you 


speed

nay  sir  less than a pound shall serve me for
carrying your letter 


proteus

you mistake  i mean the pound a pinfold 


speed

from a pound to a pin  fold it over and over 
 threefold too little for carrying a letter to
your lover 


proteus

but what said she 


speed

 first nodding   ay 


proteus

nod ay why  that noddy 


speed

you mistook  sir  i say  she did nod  and you ask
me if she did nod  and i say   ay 


proteus

and that set together is noddy 


speed

now you have taken the pains to set it together 
take it for your pains 


proteus

no  no  you shall have it for bearing the letter 


speed

well  i perceive i must be fain to bear with you 


proteus

why sir  how do you bear with me 


speed

marry  sir  the letter  very orderly  having nothing
but the word  noddy  for my pains 


proteus

beshrew me  but you have a quick wit 


speed

and yet it cannot overtake your slow purse 


proteus

come come  open the matter in brief  what said she 


speed

open your purse  that the money and the matter may
be both at once delivered 


proteus

well  sir  here is for your pains  what said she 


speed

truly  sir  i think you hardly win her 


proteus

why  couldst thou perceive so much from her 


speed

sir  i could perceive nothing at all from her  no 
not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter 
and being so hard to me that brought your mind  i
fear she prove as hard to you in telling your
mind  give her no token but stones  for she as
hard as steel 


proteus

what said she  nothing 


speed

no  not so much as  this for thy pains  to
testify your bounty  i thank you  you have testerned
me  in requital whereof  henceforth carry your
letters yourself  and so  sir  i commend you to my master 


proteus

go  go  be gone  to save your ship from wreck 
which cannot perish having thee aboard 
being destined to a drier death on shore 
exit speed
i must go send some better messenger 
i fear my julia would not deign my lines 
receiving them from such a worthless post 
exit
