scene ii  the same  garden of julia house 


enter julla and lucetta


julia

but say  lucetta  now we are alone 
wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love 


lucetta

ay  madam  so you stumble not unheedfully 


julia

of all the fair resort of gentlemen
that every day with parle encounter me 
in thy opinion which is worthiest love 


lucetta

please you repeat their names  i show my mind
according to my shallow simple skill 


julia

what think thou of the fair sir eglamour 


lucetta

as of a knight well spoken  neat and fine 
but  were i you  he never should be mine 


julia

what think thou of the rich mercatio 


lucetta

well of his wealth  but of himself  so so 


julia

what think thou of the gentle proteus 


lucetta

lord  lord  to see what folly reigns in us 


julia

how now  what means this passion at his name 


lucetta

pardon  dear madam   a passing shame
that i  unworthy body as i am 
should censure thus on lovely gentlemen 


julia

why not on proteus  as of all the rest 


lucetta

then thus  of many good i think him best 


julia

your reason 


lucetta

i have no other  but a woman reason 
i think him so because i think him so 


julia

and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him 


lucetta

ay  if you thought your love not cast away 


julia

why he  of all the rest  hath never moved me 


lucetta

yet he  of all the rest  i think  best loves ye 


julia

his little speaking shows his love but small 


lucetta

fire that closest kept burns most of all 


julia

they do not love that do not show their love 


lucetta

o  they love least that let men know their love 


julia

i would i knew his mind 


lucetta

peruse this paper  madam 


julia

 julia  say  from whom 


lucetta

that the contents will show 


julia

say  say  who gave it thee 


lucetta

valentine page  and sent  i think  from proteus 
he would have given it you  but i  being in the way 
did in your name receive it  pardon the
fault i pray 


julia

now  by my modesty  a goodly broker 
dare you presume to harbour wanton lines 
to whisper and conspire against my youth 
now  trust me   an office of great worth
and you an officer fit for the place 
or else return no more into my sight 


lucetta

to plead for love deserves more fee than hate 


julia

will ye be gone 


lucetta

                  that you may ruminate 
exit


julia

and yet i would i had o the letter 
it were a shame to call her back again
and pray her to a fault for which i chid her 
what a fool is she  that knows i am a maid 
and would not force the letter to my view 
since maids  in modesty  say  no  to that
which they would have the profferer construe  ay 
fie  fie  how wayward is this foolish love
that  like a testy babe  will scratch the nurse
and presently all humbled kiss the rod 
how churlishly i chid lucetta hence 
when willingly i would have had her here 
how angerly i taught my brow to frown 
when inward joy enforced my heart to smile 
my penance is to call lucetta back
and ask remission for my folly past 
what ho  lucetta 
re enter lucetta


lucetta

                  what would your ladyship 


julia

is near dinner time 


lucetta

i would it were 
that you might kill your stomach on your meat
and not upon your maid 


julia

what is that you took up so gingerly 


lucetta

nothing 


julia

why didst thou stoop  then 


lucetta

to take a paper up that i let fall 


julia

and is that paper nothing 


lucetta

nothing concerning me 


julia

then let it lie for those that it concerns 


lucetta

madam  it will not lie where it concerns
unless it have a false interpeter 


julia

some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme 


lucetta

that i might sing it  madam  to a tune 
give me a note  your ladyship can set 


julia

as little by such toys as may be possible 
best sing it to the tune of  o  love 


lucetta

it is too heavy for so light a tune 


julia

heavy  belike it hath some burden then 


lucetta

ay  and melodious were it  would you sing it 


julia

and why not you 


lucetta

                  i cannot reach so high 


julia

let see your song  how now  minion 


lucetta

keep tune there still  so you will sing it out 
and yet methinks i do not like this tune 


julia

you do not 


lucetta

          no  madam  it is too sharp 


julia

you  minion  are too saucy 


lucetta

nay  now you are too flat
and mar the concord with too harsh a descant 
there wanteth but a mean to fill your song 


julia

the mean is drown with your unruly bass 


lucetta

indeed  i bid the base for proteus 


julia

this babble shall not henceforth trouble me 
here is a coil with protestation 
tears the letter
go get you gone  and let the papers lie 
you would be fingering them  to anger me 


lucetta

she makes it strange  but she would be best pleased
to be so anger with another letter 
exit


julia

 nay  would i were so anger with the same 
o hateful hands  to tear such loving words 
injurious wasps  to feed on such sweet honey
and kill the bees that yield it with your stings 
i kiss each several paper for amends 
look  here is writ  julia  unkind julia 
as in revenge of thy ingratitude 
i throw thy name against the bruising stones 
trampling contemptuously on thy disdain 
and here is writ  love wounded proteus 
poor wounded name  my bosom as a bed
shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal d 
and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss 
but twice or thrice was  proteus  written down 
be calm  good wind  blow not a word away
till i have found each letter in the letter 
except mine own name  that some whirlwind bear
unto a ragged fearful hanging rock
and throw it thence into the raging sea 
lo  here in one line is his name twice writ 
 forlorn proteus  passionate proteus 
to the sweet julia  that i tear away 
and yet i will not  sith so prettily
he couples it to his complaining names 
thus will i fold them one on another 
now kiss  embrace  contend  do what you will 
re enter lucetta


lucetta

madam 
dinner is ready  and your father stays 


julia

well  let us go 


lucetta

what  shall these papers lie like tell tales here 


julia

if you respect them  best to take them up 


lucetta

nay  i was taken up for laying them down 
yet here they shall not lie  for catching cold 


julia

i see you have a month mind to them 


lucetta

ay  madam  you may say what sights you see 
i see things too  although you judge i wink 


julia

come  come  will please you go
