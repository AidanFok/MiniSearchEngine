scene iii  the same  antonio house 


enter antonio and panthino


antonio

tell me  panthino  what sad talk was that
wherewith my brother held you in the cloister 


panthino

 of his nephew proteus  your son 


antonio

why  what of him 


panthino

                  he wonder that your lordship
would suffer him to spend his youth at home 
while other men  of slender reputation 
put forth their sons to seek preferment out 
some to the wars  to try their fortune there 
some to discover islands far away 
some to the studious universities 
for any or for all these exercises 
he said that proteus your son was meet 
and did request me to importune you
to let him spend his time no more at home 
which would be great impeachment to his age 
in having known no travel in his youth 


antonio

nor need thou much importune me to that
whereon this month i have been hammering 
i have consider well his loss of time
and how he cannot be a perfect man 
not being tried and tutor in the world 
experience is by industry achieved
and perfected by the swift course of time 
then tell me  whither were i best to send him 


panthino

i think your lordship is not ignorant
how his companion  youthful valentine 
attends the emperor in his royal court 


antonio

i know it well 


panthino

 good  i think  your lordship sent him thither 
there shall he practise tilts and tournaments 
hear sweet discourse  converse with noblemen 
and be in eye of every exercise
worthy his youth and nobleness of birth 


antonio

i like thy counsel  well hast thou advised 
and that thou mayst perceive how well i like it 
the execution of it shall make known 
even with the speediest expedition
i will dispatch him to the emperor court 


panthino

to morrow  may it please you  don alphonso 
with other gentlemen of good esteem 
are journeying to salute the emperor
and to commend their service to his will 


antonio

good company  with them shall proteus go 
and  in good time  now will we break with him 
enter proteus


proteus

sweet love  sweet lines  sweet life 
here is her hand  the agent of her heart 
here is her oath for love  her honour pawn 
o  that our fathers would applaud our loves 
to seal our happiness with their consents 
o heavenly julia 


antonio

how now  what letter are you reading there 


proteus

may please your lordship   a word or two
of commendations sent from valentine 
deliver by a friend that came from him 


antonio

lend me the letter  let me see what news 


proteus

there is no news  my lord  but that he writes
how happily he lives  how well beloved
and daily graced by the emperor 
wishing me with him  partner of his fortune 


antonio

and how stand you affected to his wish 


proteus

as one relying on your lordship will
and not depending on his friendly wish 


antonio

my will is something sorted with his wish 
muse not that i thus suddenly proceed 
for what i will  i will  and there an end 
i am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
with valentinus in the emperor court 
what maintenance he from his friends receives 
like exhibition thou shalt have from me 
to morrow be in readiness to go 
excuse it not  for i am peremptory 


proteus

my lord  i cannot be so soon provided 
please you  deliberate a day or two 


antonio

look  what thou want shall be sent after thee 
no more of stay  to morrow thou must go 
come on  panthino  you shall be employ 
to hasten on his expedition 
exeunt antonio and panthino


proteus

thus have i shunn the fire for fear of burning 
and drench me in the sea  where i am drown d 
i fear to show my father julia letter 
lest he should take exceptions to my love 
and with the vantage of mine own excuse
hath he excepted most against my love 
o  how this spring of love resembleth
the uncertain glory of an april day 
which now shows all the beauty of the sun 
and by and by a cloud takes all away 
re enter panthino


panthino

sir proteus  your father calls for you 
he is in haste  therefore  i pray you to go 


proteus

why  this it is  my heart accords thereto 
and yet a thousand times it answers  no 
exeunt
