enter valentine and speed


speed

sir  your glove 


valentine

                  not mine  my gloves are on 


speed

why  then  this may be yours  for this is but one 


valentine

ha  let me see  ay  give it me  it mine 
sweet ornament that decks a thing divine 
ah  silvia  silvia 


speed

madam silvia  madam silvia 


valentine

how now  sirrah 


speed

she is not within hearing  sir 


valentine

why  sir  who bade you call her 


speed

your worship  sir  or else i mistook 


valentine

well  you still be too forward 


speed

and yet i was last chidden for being too slow 


valentine

go to  sir  tell me  do you know madam silvia 


speed

she that your worship loves 


valentine

why  how know you that i am in love 


speed

marry  by these special marks  first  you have
learned  like sir proteus  to wreathe your arms 
like a malecontent  to relish a love song  like a
robin redbreast  to walk alone  like one that had
the pestilence  to sigh  like a school boy that had
lost his a b c  to weep  like a young wench that had
buried her grandam  to fast  like one that takes
diet  to watch like one that fears robbing  to
speak puling  like a beggar at hallowmas  you were
wont  when you laughed  to crow like a cock  when you
walked  to walk like one of the lions  when you
fasted  it was presently after dinner  when you
looked sadly  it was for want of money  and now you
are metamorphosed with a mistress  that  when i look
on you  i can hardly think you my master 


valentine

are all these things perceived in me 


speed

they are all perceived without ye 


valentine

without me  they cannot 


speed

without you  nay  that certain  for  without you
were so simple  none else would  but you are so
without these follies  that these follies are within
you and shine through you like the water in an
urinal  that not an eye that sees you but is a
physician to comment on your malady 


valentine

but tell me  dost thou know my lady silvia 


speed

she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper 


valentine

hast thou observed that  even she  i mean 


speed

why  sir  i know her not 


valentine

dost thou know her by my gazing on her  and yet
knowest her not 


speed

is she not hard favoured  sir 


valentine

not so fair  boy  as well favoured 


speed

sir  i know that well enough 


valentine

what dost thou know 


speed

that she is not so fair as  of you  well favoured 


valentine

i mean that her beauty is exquisite  but her favour infinite 


speed

that because the one is painted and the other out
of all count 


valentine

how painted  and how out of count 


speed

marry  sir  so painted  to make her fair  that no
man counts of her beauty 


valentine

how esteemest thou me  i account of her beauty 


speed

you never saw her since she was deformed 


valentine

how long hath she been deformed 


speed

ever since you loved her 


valentine

i have loved her ever since i saw her  and still i
see her beautiful 


speed

if you love her  you cannot see her 


valentine

why 


speed

because love is blind  o  that you had mine eyes 
or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
have when you chid at sir proteus for going
ungartered 


valentine

what should i see then 


speed

your own present folly and her passing deformity 
for he  being in love  could not see to garter his
hose  and you  being in love  cannot see to put on your hose 


valentine

belike  boy  then  you are in love  for last
morning you could not see to wipe my shoes 


speed

true  sir  i was in love with my bed  i thank you 
you swinged me for my love  which makes me the
bolder to chide you for yours 


valentine

in conclusion  i stand affected to her 


speed

i would you were set  so your affection would cease 


valentine

last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
one she loves 


speed

and have you 


valentine

i have 


speed

are they not lamely writ 


valentine

no  boy  but as well as i can do them  peace 
here she comes 


speed

 aside   o excellent motion  o exceeding puppet 
now will he interpret to her 
enter silvia


valentine

madam and mistress  a thousand good morrows 


speed

 aside   o  give ye good even  here a million of manners 


silvia

sir valentine and servant  to you two thousand 


speed

 aside   he should give her interest and she gives it him 


valentine

as you enjoin me  i have writ your letter
unto the secret nameless friend of yours 
which i was much unwilling to proceed in
but for my duty to your ladyship 


silvia

i thank you gentle servant   very clerkly done 


valentine

now trust me  madam  it came hardly off 
for being ignorant to whom it goes
i writ at random  very doubtfully 


silvia

perchance you think too much of so much pains 


valentine

no  madam  so it stead you  i will write
please you command  a thousand times as much  and yet 


silvia

a pretty period  well  i guess the sequel 
and yet i will not name it  and yet i care not 
and yet take this again  and yet i thank you 
meaning henceforth to trouble you no more 


speed

 aside   and yet you will  and yet another  yet 


valentine

what means your ladyship  do you not like it 


silvia

yes  yes  the lines are very quaintly writ 
but since unwillingly  take them again 
nay  take them 


valentine

madam  they are for you 


silvia

ay  ay  you writ them  sir  at my request 
but i will none of them  they are for you 
i would have had them writ more movingly 


valentine

please you  i write your ladyship another 


silvia

and when it writ  for my sake read it over 
and if it please you  so  if not  why  so 


valentine

if it please me  madam  what then 


silvia

why  if it please you  take it for your labour 
and so  good morrow  servant 
exit


speed

o jest unseen  inscrutable  invisible 
as a nose on a man face  or a weathercock on a steeple 
my master sues to her  and she hath
taught her suitor 
he being her pupil  to become her tutor 
o excellent device  was there ever heard a better 
that my master  being scribe  to himself should write
the letter 


valentine

how now  sir  what are you reasoning with yourself 


speed

nay  i was rhyming   you that have the reason 


valentine

to do what 


speed

to be a spokesman for madam silvia 


valentine

to whom 


speed

to yourself  why  she wooes you by a figure 


valentine

what figure 


speed

by a letter  i should say 


valentine

why  she hath not writ to me 


speed

what need she  when she hath made you write to
yourself  why  do you not perceive the jest 


valentine

no  believe me 


speed

no believing you  indeed  sir  but did you perceive
her earnest 


valentine

she gave me none  except an angry word 


speed

why  she hath given you a letter 


valentine

that the letter i writ to her friend 


speed

and that letter hath she delivered  and there an end 


valentine

i would it were no worse 


speed

i warrant you   as well 
for often have you writ to her  and she  in modesty 
or else for want of idle time  could not again reply 
or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover 
herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover 
all this i speak in print  for in print i found it 
why muse you  sir   dinner time 


valentine

i have dined 


speed

ay  but hearken  sir  though the chameleon love can
feed on the air  i am one that am nourished by my
victuals  and would fain have meat  o  be not like
your mistress  be moved  be moved 
exeunt
