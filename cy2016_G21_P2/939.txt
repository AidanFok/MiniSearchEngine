enter launce  leading a dog


launce

nay   be this hour ere i have done weeping 
all the kind of the launces have this very fault  i
have received my proportion  like the prodigious
son  and am going with sir proteus to the imperial 
court  i think crab  my dog  be the sourest natured
dog that lives  my mother weeping  my father
wailing  my sister crying  our maid howling  our cat
wringing her hands  and all our house in a great
perplexity  yet did not this cruel hearted cur shed
one tear  he is a stone  a very pebble stone  and
has no more pity in him than a dog  a jew would have
wept to have seen our parting  why  my grandam 
having no eyes  look you  wept herself blind at my
parting  nay  i show you the manner of it  this
shoe is my father  no  this left shoe is my father 
no  no  this left shoe is my mother  nay  that
cannot be so neither  yes  it is so  it is so  it
hath the worser sole  this shoe  with the hole in
it  is my mother  and this my father  a vengeance
on t  there  tis  now  sit  this staff is my
sister  for  look you  she is as white as a lily and
as small as a wand  this hat is nan  our maid  i
am the dog  no  the dog is himself  and i am the
dog oh  the dog is me  and i am myself  ay  so 
so  now come i to my father  father  your blessing 
now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping 
now should i kiss my father  well  he weeps on  now
come i to my mother  o  that she could speak now
like a wood woman  well  i kiss her  why  there
 tis  here my mother breath up and down  now
come i to my sister  mark the moan she makes  now
the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
word  but see how i lay the dust with my tears 
enter panthino


panthino

launce  away  away  aboard  thy master is shipped
and thou art to post after with oars  what the
matter  why weepest thou  man  away  ass  you 
lose the tide  if you tarry any longer 


launce

it is no matter if the tied were lost  for it is the
unkindest tied that ever any man tied 


panthino

what the unkindest tide 


launce

why  he that tied here  crab  my dog 


panthino

tut  man  i mean thou lose the flood  and  in
losing the flood  lose thy voyage  and  in losing
thy voyage  lose thy master  and  in losing thy
master  lose thy service  and  in losing thy
service why dost thou stop my mouth 


launce

for fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue 


panthino

where should i lose my tongue 


launce

in thy tale 


panthino

in thy tail 


launce

lose the tide  and the voyage  and the master  and
the service  and the tied  why  man  if the river
were dry  i am able to fill it with my tears  if the
wind were down  i could drive the boat with my sighs 


panthino

come  come away  man  i was sent to call thee 


launce

sir  call me what thou darest 


panthino
