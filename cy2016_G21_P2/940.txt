thurio

what seem i that i am not

valentine

your folly 


thurio

and how quote you my folly 


valentine

i quote it in your jerkin 


thurio

my jerkin is a doublet 


valentine

well  then  i double your folly 


thurio

how 


silvia

what  angry  sir thurio  do you change colour 


valentine

give him leave  madam  he is a kind of chameleon 


thurio

that hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
in your air 


valentine

you have said  sir 


thurio

ay  sir  and done too  for this time 


valentine

i know it well  sir  you always end ere you begin 


silvia

a fine volley of words  gentlemen  and quickly shot off 


valentine

 indeed  madam  we thank the giver 


silvia

who is that  servant 


valentine

yourself  sweet lady  for you gave the fire  sir
thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship looks 
and spends what he borrows kindly in your company 


thurio

sir  if you spend word for word with me  i shall
make your wit bankrupt 


valentine

i know it well  sir  you have an exchequer of words 
and  i think  no other treasure to give your
followers  for it appears by their bare liveries 
that they live by your bare words 


silvia

no more  gentlemen  no more here comes my father 
enter duke


duke

now  daughter silvia  you are hard beset 
sir valentine  your father in good health 
what say you to a letter from your friends
of much good news 


valentine

                  my lord  i will be thankful 
to any happy messenger from thence 


duke

know ye don antonio  your countryman 


valentine

ay  my good lord  i know the gentleman
to be of worth and worthy estimation
and not without desert so well reputed 


duke

hath he not a son 


valentine

ay  my good lord  a son that well deserves
the honour and regard of such a father 


duke

you know him well 


valentine

i know him as myself  for from our infancy
we have conversed and spent our hours together 
and though myself have been an idle truant 
omitting the sweet benefit of time
to clothe mine age with angel like perfection 
yet hath sir proteus  for that his name 
made use and fair advantage of his days 
his years but young  but his experience old 
his head unmellow d  but his judgment ripe 
and  in a word  for far behind his worth
comes all the praises that i now bestow 
he is complete in feature and in mind
with all good grace to grace a gentleman 


duke

beshrew me  sir  but if he make this good 
he is as worthy for an empress  love
as meet to be an emperor counsellor 
well  sir  this gentleman is come to me 
with commendation from great potentates 
and here he means to spend his time awhile 
i think  no unwelcome news to you 


valentine

should i have wish a thing  it had been he 


duke

welcome him then according to his worth 
silvia  i speak to you  and you  sir thurio 
for valentine  i need not cite him to it 
i will send him hither to you presently 
exit


valentine

this is the gentleman i told your ladyship
had come along with me  but that his mistress
did hold his eyes lock in her crystal looks 


silvia

belike that now she hath enfranchised them
upon some other pawn for fealty 


valentine

nay  sure  i think she holds them prisoners still 


silvia

nay  then he should be blind  and  being blind
how could he see his way to seek out you 


valentine

why  lady  love hath twenty pair of eyes 


thurio

they say that love hath not an eye at all 


valentine

to see such lovers  thurio  as yourself 
upon a homely object love can wink 


silvia

have done  have done  here comes the gentleman 
exit thurio
enter proteus


valentine

welcome  dear proteus  mistress  i beseech you 
confirm his welcome with some special favour 


silvia

his worth is warrant for his welcome hither 
if this be he you oft have wish to hear from 


valentine

mistress  it is  sweet lady  entertain him
to be my fellow servant to your ladyship 


silvia

too low a mistress for so high a servant 


proteus

not so  sweet  lady  but too mean a servant
to have a look of such a worthy mistress 


valentine

leave off discourse of disability 
sweet lady  entertain him for your servant 


proteus

my duty will i boast of  nothing else 


silvia

and duty never yet did want his meed 
servant  you are welcome to a worthless mistress 


proteus

i die on him that says so but yourself 


silvia

that you are welcome 


proteus

that you are worthless 
re enter thurio


thurio

madam  my lord your father would speak with you 


silvia

i wait upon his pleasure  come  sir thurio 
go with me  once more  new servant  welcome 
i leave you to confer of home affairs 
when you have done  we look to hear from you 


proteus

we both attend upon your ladyship 
exeunt silvia and thurio


valentine

now  tell me  how do all from whence you came 


proteus

your friends are well and have them much commended 


valentine

and how do yours 


proteus

                  i left them all in health 


valentine

how does your lady  and how thrives your love 


proteus

my tales of love were wont to weary you 
i know you joy not in a love discourse 


valentine

ay  proteus  but that life is alter now 
i have done penance for contemning love 
whose high imperious thoughts have punish me
with bitter fasts  with penitential groans 
with nightly tears and daily heart sore sighs 
for in revenge of my contempt of love 
love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
and made them watchers of mine own heart sorrow 
o gentle proteus  love a mighty lord 
and hath so humbled me  as  i confess 
there is no woe to his correction 
nor to his service no such joy on earth 
now no discourse  except it be of love 
now can i break my fast  dine  sup and sleep 
upon the very naked name of love 


proteus

enough  i read your fortune in your eye 
was this the idol that you worship so 


valentine

even she  and is she not a heavenly saint 


proteus

no  but she is an earthly paragon 


valentine

call her divine 


proteus

                  i will not flatter her 


valentine

o  flatter me  for love delights in praises 


proteus

when i was sick  you gave me bitter pills 
and i must minister the like to you 


valentine

then speak the truth by her  if not divine 
yet let her be a principality 
sovereign to all the creatures on the earth 


proteus

except my mistress 


valentine

sweet  except not any 
except thou wilt except against my love 


proteus

have i not reason to prefer mine own 


valentine

and i will help thee to prefer her too 
she shall be dignified with this high honour 
to bear my lady train  lest the base earth
should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
and  of so great a favour growing proud 
disdain to root the summer swelling flower
and make rough winter everlastingly 


proteus

why  valentine  what braggardism is this 


valentine

pardon me  proteus  all i can is nothing
to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing 
she is alone 


proteus

                  then let her alone 


valentine

not for the world  why  man  she is mine own 
and i as rich in having such a jewel
as twenty seas  if all their sand were pearl 
the water nectar and the rocks pure gold 
forgive me that i do not dream on thee 
because thou see me dote upon my love 
my foolish rival  that her father likes
only for his possessions are so huge 
is gone with her along  and i must after 
for love  thou know st  is full of jealousy 


proteus

but she loves you 


valentine

ay  and we are betroth d  nay  more  our 
marriage hour 
with all the cunning manner of our flight 
determined of  how i must climb her window 
the ladder made of cords  and all the means
plotted and  on for my happiness 
good proteus  go with me to my chamber 
in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel 


proteus

go on before  i shall inquire you forth 
i must unto the road  to disembark
some necessaries that i needs must use 
and then i presently attend you 


valentine

will you make haste 


proteus

i will 
exit valentine
even as one heat another heat expels 
or as one nail by strength drives out another 
so the remembrance of my former love
is by a newer object quite forgotten 
is it mine  or valentine praise 
her true perfection  or my false transgression 
that makes me reasonless to reason thus 
she is fair  and so is julia that i love 
that i did love  for now my love is thaw d 
which  like a waxen image   a fire 
bears no impression of the thing it was 
methinks my zeal to valentine is cold 
and that i love him not as i was wont 
o  but i love his lady too too much 
and that the reason i love him so little 
how shall i dote on her with more advice 
that thus without advice begin to love her 
 but her picture i have yet beheld 
and that hath dazzled my reason light 
but when i look on her perfections 
there is no reason but i shall be blind 
if i can cheque my erring love  i will 
if not  to compass her i use my skill 
exit
