scene v  the same  a street 


enter speed and launce severally


speed

launce  by mine honesty  welcome to milan 


launce

forswear not thyself  sweet youth  for i am not
welcome  i reckon this always  that a man is never
undone till he be hanged  nor never welcome to a
place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
say  welcome 


speed

come on  you madcap  i to the alehouse with you
presently  where  for one shot of five pence  thou
shalt have five thousand welcomes  but  sirrah  how
did thy master part with madam julia 


launce

marry  after they closed in earnest  they parted very
fairly in jest 


speed

but shall she marry him 


launce

no 


speed

how then  shall he marry her 


launce

no  neither 


speed

what  are they broken 


launce

no  they are both as whole as a fish 


speed

why  then  how stands the matter with them 


launce

marry  thus  when it stands well with him  it
stands well with her 


speed

what an ass art thou  i understand thee not 


launce

what a block art thou  that thou canst not  my
staff understands me 


speed

what thou sayest 


launce

ay  and what i do too  look thee  i but lean 
and my staff understands me 


speed

it stands under thee  indeed 


launce

why  stand under and under stand is all one 


speed

but tell me true  will be a match 


launce

ask my dog  if he say ay  it will  if he say no 
it will  if he shake his tail and say nothing  it will 


speed

the conclusion is then that it will 


launce

thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable 


speed

 well that i get it so  but  launce  how sayest
thou  that my master is become a notable lover 


launce

i never knew him otherwise 


speed

than how 


launce

a notable lubber  as thou reportest him to be 


speed

why  thou whoreson ass  thou mistakest me 


launce

why  fool  i meant not thee  i meant thy master 


speed

i tell thee  my master is become a hot lover 


launce

why  i tell thee  i care not though he burn himself
in love  if thou wilt  go with me to the alehouse 
if not  thou art an hebrew  a jew  and not worth the
name of a christian 


speed

why 


launce

because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
go to the ale with a christian  wilt thou go 


speed

at thy service
