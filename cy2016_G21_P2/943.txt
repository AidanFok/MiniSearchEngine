scene vii  verona  julia house 


enter julia and lucetta


julia

counsel  lucetta  gentle girl  assist me 
and even in kind love i do conjure thee 
who art the table wherein all my thoughts
are visibly character and engraved 
to lesson me and tell me some good mean
how  with my honour  i may undertake
a journey to my loving proteus 


lucetta

alas  the way is wearisome and long 


julia

a true devoted pilgrim is not weary
to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps 
much less shall she that hath love wings to fly 
and when the flight is made to one so dear 
of such divine perfection  as sir proteus 


lucetta

better forbear till proteus make return 


julia

o  know thou not his looks are my soul food 
pity the dearth that i have pined in 
by longing for that food so long a time 
didst thou but know the inly touch of love 
thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
as seek to quench the fire of love with words 


lucetta

i do not seek to quench your love hot fire 
but qualify the fire extreme rage 
lest it should burn above the bounds of reason 


julia

the more thou damm it up  the more it burns 
the current that with gentle murmur glides 
thou know st  being stopp d  impatiently doth rage 
but when his fair course is not hindered 
he makes sweet music with the enamell stones 
giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
he overtaketh in his pilgrimage 
and so by many winding nooks he strays
with willing sport to the wild ocean 
then let me go and hinder not my course
i be as patient as a gentle stream
and make a pastime of each weary step 
till the last step have brought me to my love 
and there i rest  as after much turmoil
a blessed soul doth in elysium 


lucetta

but in what habit will you go along 


julia

not like a woman  for i would prevent
the loose encounters of lascivious men 
gentle lucetta  fit me with such weeds
as may beseem some well reputed page 


lucetta

why  then  your ladyship must cut your hair 


julia

no  girl  i knit it up in silken strings
with twenty odd conceited true love knots 
to be fantastic may become a youth
of greater time than i shall show to be 


lucetta

what fashion  madam shall i make your breeches 


julia

that fits as well as  me  good my lord 
what compass will you wear your farthingale 
why even what fashion thou best likest  lucetta 


lucetta

you must needs have them with a codpiece  madam 


julia

out  out  lucetta  that would be ill favour d 


lucetta

a round hose  madam  now not worth a pin 
unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on 


julia

lucetta  as thou lovest me  let me have
what thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly 
but tell me  wench  how will the world repute me
for undertaking so unstaid a journey 
i fear me  it will make me scandalized 


lucetta

if you think so  then stay at home and go not 


julia

nay  that i will not 


lucetta

then never dream on infamy  but go 
if proteus like your journey when you come 
no matter who displeased when you are gone 
i fear me  he will scarce be pleased withal 


julia

that is the least  lucetta  of my fear 
a thousand oaths  an ocean of his tears
and instances of infinite of love
warrant me welcome to my proteus 


lucetta

all these are servants to deceitful men 


julia

base men  that use them to so base effect 
but truer stars did govern proteus  birth
his words are bonds  his oaths are oracles 
his love sincere  his thoughts immaculate 
his tears pure messengers sent from his heart 
his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth 


lucetta

pray heaven he prove so  when you come to him 


julia

now  as thou lovest me  do him not that wrong
to bear a hard opinion of his truth 
only deserve my love by loving him 
and presently go with me to my chamber 
to take a note of what i stand in need of 
to furnish me upon my longing journey 
all that is mine i leave at thy dispose 
my goods  my lands  my reputation 
only  in lieu thereof  dispatch me hence 
come  answer not  but to it presently 
i am impatient of my tarriance 
exeunt
