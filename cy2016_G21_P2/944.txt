scene i  milan  the duke palace 


enter duke  thurio  and proteus


duke

sir thurio  give us leave  i pray  awhile 
we have some secrets to confer about 
exit thurio
now  tell me  proteus  what your will with me 


proteus

my gracious lord  that which i would discover
the law of friendship bids me to conceal 
but when i call to mind your gracious favours
done to me  undeserving as i am 
my duty pricks me on to utter that
which else no worldly good should draw from me 
know  worthy prince  sir valentine  my friend 
this night intends to steal away your daughter 
myself am one made privy to the plot 
i know you have determined to bestow her
on thurio  whom your gentle daughter hates 
and should she thus be stol away from you 
it would be much vexation to your age 
thus  for my duty sake  i rather chose
to cross my friend in his intended drift
than  by concealing it  heap on your head
a pack of sorrows which would press you down 
being unprevented  to your timeless grave 


duke

proteus  i thank thee for thine honest care 
which to requite  command me while i live 
this love of theirs myself have often seen 
haply when they have judged me fast asleep 
and oftentimes have purposed to forbid
sir valentine her company and my court 
but fearing lest my jealous aim might err
and so unworthily disgrace the man 
a rashness that i ever yet have shunn d 
i gave him gentle looks  thereby to find
that which thyself hast now disclosed to me 
and  that thou mayst perceive my fear of this 
knowing that tender youth is soon suggested 
i nightly lodge her in an upper tower 
the key whereof myself have ever kept 
and thence she cannot be convey away 


proteus

know  noble lord  they have devised a mean
how he her chamber window will ascend
and with a corded ladder fetch her down 
for which the youthful lover now is gone
and this way comes he with it presently 
where  if it please you  you may intercept him 
but  good my lord  do it so cunningly
that my discovery be not aimed at 
for love of you  not hate unto my friend 
hath made me publisher of this pretence 


duke

upon mine honour  he shall never know
that i had any light from thee of this 


proteus

adieu  my lord  sir valentine is coming 
exit
enter valentine


duke

sir valentine  whither away so fast 


valentine

please it your grace  there is a messenger
that stays to bear my letters to my friends 
and i am going to deliver them 


duke

be they of much import 


valentine

the tenor of them doth but signify
my health and happy being at your court 


duke

nay then  no matter  stay with me awhile 
i am to break with thee of some affairs
that touch me near  wherein thou must be secret 
 not unknown to thee that i have sought
to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter 


valentine

i know it well  my lord  and  sure  the match
were rich and honourable  besides  the gentleman
is full of virtue  bounty  worth and qualities
beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter 
cannot your grace win her to fancy him 


duke

no  trust me  she is peevish  sullen  froward 
proud  disobedient  stubborn  lacking duty 
neither regarding that she is my child
nor fearing me as if i were her father 
and  may i say to thee  this pride of hers 
upon advice  hath drawn my love from her 
and  where i thought the remnant of mine age
should have been cherish by her child like duty 
i now am full resolved to take a wife
and turn her out to who will take her in 
then let her beauty be her wedding dower 
for me and my possessions she esteems not 


valentine

what would your grace have me to do in this 


duke

there is a lady in verona here
whom i affect  but she is nice and coy
and nought esteems my aged eloquence 
now therefore would i have thee to my tutor 
for long agone i have forgot to court 
besides  the fashion of the time is changed 
how and which way i may bestow myself
to be regarded in her sun bright eye 


valentine

win her with gifts  if she respect not words 
dumb jewels often in their silent kind
more than quick words do move a woman mind 


duke

but she did scorn a present that i sent her 


valentine

a woman sometimes scorns what best contents her 
send her another  never give her o er 
for scorn at first makes after love the more 
if she do frown   not in hate of you 
but rather to beget more love in you 
if she do chide   not to have you gone 
for why  the fools are mad  if left alone 
take no repulse  whatever she doth say 
for  you gone  she doth not mean  away 
flatter and praise  commend  extol their graces 
though ne so black  say they have angels  faces 
that man that hath a tongue  i say  is no man 
if with his tongue he cannot win a woman 


duke

but she i mean is promised by her friends
unto a youthful gentleman of worth 
and kept severely from resort of men 
that no man hath access by day to her 


valentine

why  then  i would resort to her by night 


duke

ay  but the doors be lock and keys kept safe 
that no man hath recourse to her by night 


valentine

what lets but one may enter at her window 


duke

her chamber is aloft  far from the ground 
and built so shelving that one cannot climb it
without apparent hazard of his life 


valentine

why then  a ladder quaintly made of cords 
to cast up  with a pair of anchoring hooks 
would serve to scale another hero tower 
so bold leander would adventure it 


duke

now  as thou art a gentleman of blood 
advise me where i may have such a ladder 


valentine

when would you use it  pray  sir  tell me that 


duke

this very night  for love is like a child 
that longs for every thing that he can come by 


valentine

by seven o i get you such a ladder 


duke

but  hark thee  i will go to her alone 
how shall i best convey the ladder thither 


valentine

it will be light  my lord  that you may bear it
under a cloak that is of any length 


duke

a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn 


valentine

ay  my good lord 


duke

                  then let me see thy cloak 
i get me one of such another length 


valentine

why  any cloak will serve the turn  my lord 


duke

how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak 
i pray thee  let me feel thy cloak upon me 
what letter is this same  what here   silvia 
and here an engine fit for my proceeding 
i be so bold to break the seal for once 
reads
 thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly 
and slaves they are to me that send them flying 
o  could their master come and go as lightly 
himself would lodge where senseless they are lying 
my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them 
while i  their king  that hither them importune 
do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless them 
because myself do want my servants  fortune 
i curse myself  for they are sent by me 
that they should harbour where their lord would be 
what here 
 silvia  this night i will enfranchise thee 
 so  and here the ladder for the purpose 
why  phaeton for thou art merops  son 
wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
and with thy daring folly burn the world 
wilt thou reach stars  because they shine on thee 
go  base intruder  overweening slave 
bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates 
and think my patience  more than thy desert 
is privilege for thy departure hence 
thank me for this more than for all the favours
which all too much i have bestow on thee 
but if thou linger in my territories
longer than swiftest expedition
will give thee time to leave our royal court 
by heaven  my wrath shall far exceed the love
i ever bore my daughter or thyself 
be gone  i will not hear thy vain excuse 
but  as thou lovest thy life  make speed from hence 
exit


valentine

and why not death rather than living torment 
to die is to be banish from myself 
and silvia is myself  banish from her
is self from self  a deadly banishment 
what light is light  if silvia be not seen 
what joy is joy  if silvia be not by 
unless it be to think that she is by
and feed upon the shadow of perfection
except i be by silvia in the night 
there is no music in the nightingale 
unless i look on silvia in the day 
there is no day for me to look upon 
she is my essence  and i leave to be 
if i be not by her fair influence
foster d  illumined  cherish d  kept alive 
i fly not death  to fly his deadly doom 
tarry i here  i but attend on death 
but  fly i hence  i fly away from life 
enter proteus and launce


proteus

run  boy  run  run  and seek him out

valentine

my ears are stopt and cannot hear good news 
so much of bad already hath possess them 


proteus

then in dumb silence will i bury mine 
for they are harsh  untuneable and bad 


valentine

is silvia dead 


proteus

no  valentine 


valentine

no valentine  indeed  for sacred silvia 
hath she forsworn me

valentine

o  i have fed upon this woe already 
and now excess of it will make me surfeit 
doth silvia know that i am banished 


proteus

ay  ay  and she hath offer to the doom 
which  unreversed  stands in effectual force 
a sea of melting pearl  which some call tears 
those at her father churlish feet she tender d 
with them  upon her knees  her humble self 
wringing her hands  whose whiteness so became them
as if but now they waxed pale for woe 
but neither bended knees  pure hands held up 
sad sighs  deep groans  nor silver shedding tears 
could penetrate her uncompassionate sire 
but valentine  if he be ta en  must die 
besides  her intercession chafed him so 
when she for thy repeal was suppliant 
that to close prison he commanded her 
with many bitter threats of biding there 


valentine

no more  unless the next word that thou speak 
have some malignant power upon my life 
if so  i pray thee  breathe it in mine ear 
as ending anthem of my endless dolour 


proteus

cease to lament for that thou canst not help 
and study help for that which thou lament st 
time is the nurse and breeder of all good 
here if thou stay  thou canst not see thy love 
besides  thy staying will abridge thy life 
hope is a lover staff  walk hence with that
and manage it against despairing thoughts 
thy letters may be here  though thou art hence 
which  being writ to me  shall be deliver 
even in the milk white bosom of thy love 
the time now serves not to expostulate 
come  i convey thee through the city gate 
and  ere i part with thee  confer at large
of all that may concern thy love affairs 
as thou lovest silvia  though not for thyself 
regard thy danger  and along with me

bid him make haste and meet me at the north gate
