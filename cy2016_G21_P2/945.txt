scene ii  the same  the duke palace 


enter duke and thurio


duke

sir thurio  fear not but that she will love you 
now valentine is banish from her sight 


thurio

since his exile she hath despised me most 
forsworn my company and rail at me 
that i am desperate of obtaining her 


duke

this weak impress of love is as a figure
trenched in ice  which with an hour heat
dissolves to water and doth lose his form 
a little time will melt her frozen thoughts
and worthless valentine shall be forgot 
enter proteus
how now  sir proteus  is your countryman
according to our proclamation gone 


proteus

gone  my good lord 


duke

my daughter takes his going grievously 


proteus

a little time  my lord  will kill that grief 


duke

so i believe  but thurio thinks not so 
proteus  the good conceit i hold of thee 
for thou hast shown some sign of good desert 
makes me the better to confer with thee 


proteus

longer than i prove loyal to your grace
let me not live to look upon your grace 


duke

thou know how willingly i would effect
the match between sir thurio and my daughter 


proteus

i do  my lord 


duke

and also  i think  thou art not ignorant
how she opposes her against my will


proteus

she did  my lord  when valentine was here 


duke

ay  and perversely she persevers so 
what might we do to make the girl forget
the love of valentine and love sir thurio 


proteus

the best way is to slander valentine
with falsehood  cowardice and poor descent 
three things that women highly hold in hate 


duke

ay  but she think that it is spoke in hate 


proteus

ay  if his enemy deliver it 
therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
by one whom she esteemeth as his friend 


duke

then you must undertake to slander him 


proteus

and that  my lord  i shall be loath to do 
 an ill office for a gentleman 
especially against his very friend 


duke

where your good word cannot advantage him 
your slander never can endamage him 
therefore the office is indifferent 
being entreated to it by your friend 


proteus

you have prevail d  my lord  if i can do it
by ought that i can speak in his dispraise 
she shall not long continue love to him 
but say this weed her love from valentine 
it follows not that she will love sir thurio 


thurio

therefore  as you unwind her love from him 
lest it should ravel and be good to none 
you must provide to bottom it on me 
which must be done by praising me as much
as you in worth dispraise sir valentine 


duke

and  proteus  we dare trust you in this kind 
because we know  on valentine report 
you are already love firm votary
and cannot soon revolt and change your mind 
upon this warrant shall you have access
where you with silvia may confer at large 
for she is lumpish  heavy  melancholy 
and  for your friend sake  will be glad of you 
where you may temper her by your persuasion
to hate young valentine and love my friend 


proteus

as much as i can do  i will effect 
but you  sir thurio  are not sharp enough 
you must lay lime to tangle her desires
by wailful sonnets  whose composed rhymes
should be full fraught with serviceable vows 


duke

ay 
much is the force of heaven bred poesy 


proteus

say that upon the altar of her beauty
you sacrifice your tears  your sighs  your heart 
write till your ink be dry  and with your tears
moist it again  and frame some feeling line
that may discover such integrity 
for orpheus  lute was strung with poets  sinews 
whose golden touch could soften steel and stones 
make tigers tame and huge leviathans
forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands 
after your dire lamenting elegies 
visit by night your lady chamber window
with some sweet concert  to their instruments
tune a deploring dump  the night dead silence
will well become such sweet complaining grievance 
this  or else nothing  will inherit her 


duke

this discipline shows thou hast been in love 


thurio

and thy advice this night i put in practise 
therefore  sweet proteus  my direction giver 
let us into the city presently
to sort some gentlemen well skill in music 
i have a sonnet that will serve the turn
to give the onset to thy good advice 


duke

about it  gentlemen 


proteus

we wait upon your grace till after supper 
and afterward determine our proceedings 


duke

even now about it  i will pardon you 
exeunt
