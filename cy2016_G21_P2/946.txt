if not  we make you sit and rifle you 


speed

sir  we are undone  these are the villains
that all the travellers do fear so much 


valentine

my friends 


first outlaw

that not so  sir  we are your enemies 


second outlaw

peace  we hear him 


third outlaw

ay  by my beard  will we  for he a proper man 


valentine

then know that i have little wealth to lose 
a man i am cross with adversity 
my riches are these poor habiliments 
of which if you should here disfurnish me 
you take the sum and substance that i have 


second outlaw

whither travel you 


valentine

to verona 


first outlaw

whence came you 


valentine

from milan 


third outlaw

have you long sojourned there 


valentine

some sixteen months  and longer might have stay d 
if crooked fortune had not thwarted me 


first outlaw

what  were you banish thence 


valentine

i was 


second outlaw

for what offence 


valentine

for that which now torments me to rehearse 
i kill a man  whose death i much repent 
bu t yet i slew him manfully in fight 
without false vantage or base treachery 


first outlaw

why  ne repent it  if it were done so 
but were you banish for so small a fault 


valentine

i was  and held me glad of such a doom 


second outlaw

have you the tongues 


valentine

my youthful travel therein made me happy 
or else i often had been miserable 


third outlaw

by the bare scalp of robin hood fat friar 
this fellow were a king for our wild faction 


first outlaw

we have him  sirs  a word 


speed

master  be one of them  it an honourable kind of thievery 


valentine

peace  villain 


second outlaw

tell us this  have you any thing to take to 


valentine

nothing but my fortune 


third outlaw

know  then  that some of us are gentlemen 
such as the fury of ungovern youth
thrust from the company of awful men 
myself was from verona banished
for practising to steal away a lady 
an heir  and near allied unto the duke 


second outlaw

and i from mantua  for a gentleman 
who  in my mood  i stabb unto the heart 


first outlaw

and i for such like petty crimes as these 
but to the purpose for we cite our faults 
that they may hold excus our lawless lives 
and partly  seeing you are beautified
with goodly shape and by your own report
a linguist and a man of such perfection
as we do in our quality much want 


second outlaw

indeed  because you are a banish man 
therefore  above the rest  we parley to you 
are you content to be our general 
to make a virtue of necessity
and live  as we do  in this wilderness 


third outlaw

what say thou  wilt thou be of our consort 
say ay  and be the captain of us all 
we do thee homage and be ruled by thee 
love thee as our commander and our king 


first outlaw

but if thou scorn our courtesy  thou diest 


second outlaw

thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer d 


valentine

i take your offer and will live with you 
provided that you do no outrages
on silly women or poor passengers 


third outlaw

no  we detest such vile base practises 
come  go with us  we bring thee to our crews 
and show thee all the treasure we have got 
which  with ourselves  all rest at thy dispose 
exeunt
