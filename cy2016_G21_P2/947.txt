enter proteus


proteus

already have i been false to valentine
and now i must be as unjust to thurio 
under the colour of commending him 
i have access my own love to prefer 
but silvia is too fair  too true  too holy 
to be corrupted with my worthless gifts 
when i protest true loyalty to her 
she twits me with my falsehood to my friend 
when to her beauty i commend my vows 
she bids me think how i have been forsworn
in breaking faith with julia whom i loved 
and notwithstanding all her sudden quips 
the least whereof would quell a lover hope 
yet  spaniel like  the more she spurns my love 
the more it grows and fawneth on her still 
but here comes thurio  now must we to her window 
and give some evening music to her ear 
enter thurio and musicians


thurio

how now  sir proteus  are you crept before us 


proteus

ay  gentle thurio  for you know that love
will creep in service where it cannot go 


thurio

ay  but i hope  sir  that you love not here 


proteus

sir  but i do  or else i would be hence 


thurio

who  silvia 


proteus

song 
who is silvia  what is she 
that all our swains commend her 
holy  fair and wise is she 
the heaven such grace did lend her 
that she might admired be 
is she kind as she is fair 
for beauty lives with kindness 
love doth to her eyes repair 
to help him of his blindness 
and  being help d  inhabits there 
then to silvia let us sing 
that silvia is excelling 
she excels each mortal thing
upon the dull earth dwelling 
to her let us garlands bring 


host

how now  are you sadder than you were before  how
do you  man  the music likes you not 


julia

you mistake  the musician likes me not 


host

why  my pretty youth 


julia

he plays false  father 


host

how  out of tune on the strings 


julia

not so  but yet so false that he grieves my very
heart strings 


host

you have a quick ear 


julia

ay  i would i were deaf  it makes me have a slow heart 


host

i perceive you delight not in music 


julia

not a whit  when it jars so 


host

hark  what fine change is in the music 


julia

ay  that change is the spite 


host

you would have them always play but one thing 


julia

i would always have one play but one thing 
but  host  doth this sir proteus that we talk on
often resort unto this gentlewoman 


host

i tell you what launce  his man  told me  he loved
her out of all nick 


julia

host

gone to seek his dog  which tomorrow  by his
master command  he must carry for a present to his lady 


julia

proteus

sir thurio  fear not you  i will so plead
that you shall say my cunning drift excels 


thurio

                  at saint gregory well 


thurio

farewell 
exeunt thurio and musicians
enter silvia above


proteus

madam  good even to your ladyship 


silvia

i thank you for your music  gentlemen 
who is that that spake 


proteus

one  lady  if you knew his pure heart truth 
you would quickly learn to know him by his voice 


silvia

sir proteus  as i take it 


proteus

sir proteus  gentle lady  and your servant 


silvia

what your will 


proteus

                  that i may compass yours 


silvia

you have your wish  my will is even this 
that presently you hie you home to bed 
thou subtle  perjured  false  disloyal man 
think thou i am so shallow  so conceitless 
to be seduced by thy flattery 
that hast deceived so many with thy vows 
return  return  and make thy love amends 
for me  by this pale queen of night i swear 
i am so far from granting thy request
that i despise thee for thy wrongful suit 
and by and by intend to chide myself
even for this time i spend in talking to thee 


proteus

i grant  sweet love  that i did love a lady 
but she is dead 


julia

 aside          false  if i should speak it 
for i am sure she is not buried 


silvia

say that she be  yet valentine thy friend
survives  to whom  thyself art witness 
i am betroth d  and art thou not ashamed
to wrong him with thy importunacy 


proteus

i likewise hear that valentine is dead 


silvia

and so suppose am i  for in his grave
assure thyself my love is buried 


proteus

sweet lady  let me rake it from the earth 


silvia

go to thy lady grave and call hers thence 
or  at the least  in hers sepulchre thine 


julia

 aside   he heard not that 


proteus

madam  if your heart be so obdurate 
vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love 
the picture that is hanging in your chamber 
to that i speak  to that i sigh and weep 
for since the substance of your perfect self
is else devoted  i am but a shadow 
and to your shadow will i make true love 


julia

 aside   if  a substance  you would  sure 
deceive it 
and make it but a shadow  as i am 


silvia

i am very loath to be your idol  sir 
but since your falsehood shall become you well
to worship shadows and adore false shapes 
send to me in the morning and i send it 
and so  good rest 


proteus

                  as wretches have o 
that wait for execution in the morn 
exeunt proteus and silvia severally


julia

host  will you go 


host

by my halidom  i was fast asleep 


julia

pray you  where lies sir proteus 


host

marry  at my house  trust me  i think  almost
day 


julia

not so  but it hath been the longest night
that e i watch and the most heaviest 
exeunt
