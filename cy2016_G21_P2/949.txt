four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it 
i have taught him  even as one would say precisely 
 i would teach a dog  i was sent to deliver
him as a present to mistress silvia from my master 
and i came no sooner into the dining chamber but he
steps me to her trencher and steals her capon leg 
o   a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
in all companies  i would have  as one should say 
one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed  to be 
as it were  a dog at all things  if i had not had
more wit than he  to take a fault upon me that he did 
i think verily he had been hanged for t  sure as i
live  he had suffered for t  you shall judge  he
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
gentlemanlike dogs under the duke table  he had
not been there bless the mark a pissing while  but
all the chamber smelt him   with the dog  says
one   cur is that  says another   him
out  says the third   him up  says the duke 
i  having been acquainted with the smell before 
knew it was crab  and goes me to the fellow that
whips the dogs   friend  quoth i   mean to whip
the dog   ay  marry  do i  quoth he   do him
the more wrong  quoth i   i did the thing you
wot of  he makes me no more ado  but whips me out
of the chamber  how many masters would do this for
his servant  nay  i be sworn  i have sat in the
stocks for puddings he hath stolen  otherwise he had
been executed  i have stood on the pillory for geese
he hath killed  otherwise he had suffered for t 
thou thinkest not of this now  nay  i remember the
trick you served me when i took my leave of madam
silvia  did not i bid thee still mark me and do as i
do  when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
water against a gentlewoman farthingale  didst
thou ever see me do such a trick 
enter proteus and julia

to launce
how now  you whoreson peasant 
where have you been these two days loitering

back again 


proteus

what  didst thou offer her this from me 


launce

ay  sir  the other squirrel was stolen from me by
the hangman boys in the market place  and then i

or ne return again into my sight 
away  i say  stay thou to vex me here 
exit launce
a slave  that still an end turns me to shame 
sebastian  i have entertained thee 
partly that i have need of such a youth
that can with some discretion do my business 
for  no trusting to yond foolish lout 
but chiefly for thy face and thy behavior 
which  if my augury deceive me not 
witness good bringing up  fortune and truth 
therefore know thou  for this i entertain thee 
go presently and take this ring with thee 
deliver it to madam silvia 
she loved me well deliver it to me 


julia

it seems you loved not her  to leave her token 
she is dead  belike 


proteus

not so  i think she lives 


julia

alas 


proteus

why dost thou cry  alas 


julia

i cannot choose
but pity her 


proteus

                  wherefore shouldst thou pity her 


julia

because methinks that she loved you as well
as you do love your lady silvia 
she dreams of him that has forgot her love 
you dote on her that cares not for your love 
 pity love should be so contrary 
and thinking of it makes me cry  alas 


proteus

well  give her that ring and therewithal
this letter  that her chamber  tell my lady
i claim the promise for her heavenly picture 
your message done  hie home unto my chamber 
where thou shalt find me  sad and solitary 
exit


julia

how many women would do such a message 
alas  poor proteus  thou hast entertain 
a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs 
alas  poor fool  why do i pity him
that with his very heart despiseth me 
because he loves her  he despiseth me 
because i love him i must pity him 
this ring i gave him when he parted from me 
to bind him to remember my good will 
and now am i  unhappy messenger 
to plead for that which i would not obtain 
to carry that which i would have refused 
to praise his faith which i would have dispraised 
i am my master true confirmed love 
but cannot be true servant to my master 
unless i prove false traitor to myself 
yet will i woo for him  but yet so coldly
as  heaven it knows  i would not have him speed 
enter silvia  attended
gentlewoman  good day  i pray you  be my mean
to bring me where to speak with madam silvia 


silvia

what would you with her  if that i be she 


julia

if you be she  i do entreat your patience
to hear me speak the message i am sent on 


silvia

from whom 


julia

from my master  sir proteus  madam 


silvia

o  he sends you for a picture 


julia

ay  madam 


silvia

ursula  bring my picture here 
go give your master this  tell him from me 
one julia  that his changing thoughts forget 
would better fit his chamber than this shadow 


julia

madam  please you peruse this letter 
pardon me  madam  i have unadvised
deliver you a paper that i should not 
this is the letter to your ladyship 


silvia

i pray thee  let me look on that again 


julia

it may not be  good madam  pardon me 


silvia

there  hold 
i will not look upon your master lines 
i know they are stuff with protestations
and full of new found oaths  which he will break
as easily as i do tear his paper 


julia

madam  he sends your ladyship this ring 


silvia

the more shame for him that he sends it me 
for i have heard him say a thousand times
his julia gave it him at his departure 
though his false finger have profaned the ring 
mine shall not do his julia so much wrong 


julia

she thanks you 


silvia

what say thou 


julia

i thank you  madam  that you tender her 
poor gentlewoman  my master wrongs her much 


silvia

dost thou know her 


julia

almost as well as i do know myself 
to think upon her woes i do protest
that i have wept a hundred several times 


silvia

belike she thinks that proteus hath forsook her 


julia

i think she doth  and that her cause of sorrow 


silvia

is she not passing fair 


julia

she hath been fairer  madam  than she is 
when she did think my master loved her well 
she  in my judgment  was as fair as you 
but since she did neglect her looking glass
and threw her sun expelling mask away 
the air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
and pinch the lily tincture of her face 
that now she is become as black as i 


silvia

how tall was she 


julia

about my stature  for at pentecost 
when all our pageants of delight were play d 
our youth got me to play the woman part 
and i was trimm in madam julia gown 
which served me as fit  by all men judgments 
as if the garment had been made for me 
therefore i know she is about my height 
and at that time i made her weep agood 
for i did play a lamentable part 
madam   ariadne passioning
for theseus  perjury and unjust flight 
which i so lively acted with my tears
that my poor mistress  moved therewithal 
wept bitterly  and would i might be dead
if i in thought felt not her very sorrow 


silvia

she is beholding to thee  gentle youth 
alas  poor lady  desolate and left 
i weep myself to think upon thy words 
here  youth  there is my purse  i give thee this
for thy sweet mistress  sake  because thou lovest her 
farewell 
exit silvia  with attendants


julia

and she shall thank you for t  if e you know her 
a virtuous gentlewoman  mild and beautiful
i hope my master suit will be but cold 
since she respects my mistress  love so much 
alas  how love can trifle with itself 
here is her picture  let me see  i think 
if i had such a tire  this face of mine
were full as lovely as is this of hers 
and yet the painter flatter her a little 
unless i flatter with myself too much 
her hair is auburn  mine is perfect yellow 
if that be all the difference in his love 
i get me such a colour periwig 
her eyes are grey as glass  and so are mine 
ay  but her forehead low  and mine as high 
what should it be that he respects in her
but i can make respective in myself 
if this fond love were not a blinded god 
come  shadow  come and take this shadow up 
for  thy rival  o thou senseless form 
thou shalt be worshipp d  kiss d  loved and adored 
and  were there sense in his idolatry 
my substance should be statue in thy stead 
i use thee kindly for thy mistress  sake 
that used me so  or else  by jove i vow 
i should have scratch out your unseeing eyes
to make my master out of love with thee 
exit
