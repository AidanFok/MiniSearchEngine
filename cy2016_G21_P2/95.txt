alarum  excursions  enter warwick


warwick

forspent with toil  as runners with a race 
i lay me down a little while to breathe 
for strokes received  and many blows repaid 
have robb my strong knit sinews of their strength 
and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile 
enter edward  running


edward

smile  gentle heaven  or strike  ungentle death 
for this world frowns  and edward sun is clouded 


warwick

how now  my lord  what hap  what hope of good 
enter george


george

our hap is loss  our hope but sad despair 
our ranks are broke  and ruin follows us 
what counsel give you  whither shall we fly 


edward

bootless is flight  they follow us with wings 
and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit 
enter richard


richard

ah  warwick  why hast thou withdrawn thyself 
thy brother blood the thirsty earth hath drunk 
broach with the steely point of clifford lance 
and in the very pangs of death he cried 
like to a dismal clangour heard from far 
 warwick  revenge  brother  revenge my death 
so  underneath the belly of their steeds 
that stain their fetlocks in his smoking blood 
the noble gentleman gave up the ghost 


warwick

then let the earth be drunken with our blood 
i kill my horse  because i will not fly 
why stand we like soft hearted women here 
wailing our losses  whiles the foe doth rage 
and look upon  as if the tragedy
were play in jest by counterfeiting actors 
here on my knee i vow to god above 
i never pause again  never stand still 
till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
or fortune given me measure of revenge 


edward

o warwick  i do bend my knee with thine 
and in this vow do chain my soul to thine 
and  ere my knee rise from the earth cold face 
i throw my hands  mine eyes  my heart to thee 
thou setter up and plucker down of kings 
beseeching thee  if with they will it stands
that to my foes this body must be prey 
yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope 
and give sweet passage to my sinful soul 
now  lords  take leave until we meet again 
where it be  in heaven or in earth 


richard

brother  give me thy hand  and  gentle warwick 
let me embrace thee in my weary arms 
i  that did never weep  now melt with woe
that winter should cut off our spring time so 


warwick

away  away  once more  sweet lords farewell 


george

yet let us all together to our troops 
and give them leave to fly that will not stay 
and call them pillars that will stand to us 
and  if we thrive  promise them such rewards
as victors wear at the olympian games 
this may plant courage in their quailing breasts 
for yet is hope of life and victory 
forslow no longer  make we hence amain
