eglamour

the sun begins to gild the western sky 
and now it is about the very hour
that silvia  at friar patrick cell  should meet me 
she will not fail  for lovers break not hours 
unless it be to come before their time 
so much they spur their expedition 
see where she comes 
enter silvia
lady  a happy evening 


silvia

amen  amen  go on  good eglamour 
out at the postern by the abbey wall 
i fear i am attended by some spies 


eglamour

fear not  the forest is not three leagues off 
if we recover that  we are sure enough
