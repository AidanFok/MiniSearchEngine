scene ii  the same  the duke palace 


enter thurio  proteus  and julia


thurio

sir proteus  what says silvia to my suit 


proteus

o  sir  i find her milder than she was 
and yet she takes exceptions at your person 


thurio

what  that my leg is too long 


proteus

no  that it is too little 


thurio

i wear a boot  to make it somewhat rounder 


julia

 aside   but love will not be spurr to what
it loathes 


thurio

what says she to my face 


proteus

she says it is a fair one 


thurio

nay then  the wanton lies  my face is black 


proteus

but pearls are fair  and the old saying is 
black men are pearls in beauteous ladies  eyes 


julia

 aside    true  such pearls as put out
ladies  eyes 
for i had rather wink than look on them 


thurio

how likes she my discourse 


proteus

ill  when you talk of war 


thurio

but well  when i discourse of love and peace 


julia

 aside   but better  indeed  when you hold your peace 


thurio

what says she to my valour 


proteus

o  sir  she makes no doubt of that 


julia

 aside   she needs not  when she knows it cowardice 


thurio

what says she to my birth 


proteus

that you are well derived 


julia

 aside   true  from a gentleman to a fool 


thurio

considers she my possessions 


proteus

o  ay  and pities them 


thurio

wherefore 


julia

 aside   that such an ass should owe them 


proteus

that they are out by lease 


julia

here comes the duke 
enter duke


duke

how now  sir proteus  how now  thurio 
which of you saw sir eglamour of late 


thurio

not i 


proteus

     nor i 


duke

          saw you my daughter 


proteus

neither 


duke

why then 
she fled unto that peasant valentine 
and eglamour is in her company 
 true  for friar laurence met them both 
as he in penance wander through the forest 
him he knew well  and guess that it was she 
but  being mask d  he was not sure of it 
besides  she did intend confession
at patrick cell this even  and there she was not 
these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence 
therefore  i pray you  stand not to discourse 
but mount you presently and meet with me
upon the rising of the mountain foot
that leads towards mantua  whither they are fled 
dispatch  sweet gentlemen  and follow me 
exit


thurio

why  this it is to be a peevish girl 
that flies her fortune when it follows her 
i after  more to be revenged on eglamour
than for the love of reckless silvia 
exit


proteus

and i will follow  more for silvia love
than hate of eglamour that goes with her 
exit


julia

and i will follow  more to cross that love
than hate for silvia that is gone for love 
exit
