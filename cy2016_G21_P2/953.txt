valentine

how use doth breed a habit in a man 
this shadowy desert  unfrequented woods 
i better brook than flourishing peopled towns 
here can i sit alone  unseen of any 
and to the nightingale complaining notes
tune my distresses and record my woes 
o thou that dost inhabit in my breast 
leave not the mansion so long tenantless 
lest  growing ruinous  the building fall
and leave no memory of what it was 
repair me with thy presence  silvia 
thou gentle nymph  cherish thy forlorn swain 
what halloing and what stir is this to day 
these are my mates  that make their wills their law 
have some unhappy passenger in chase 
they love me well  yet i have much to do
to keep them from uncivil outrages 
withdraw thee  valentine  who this comes here 
enter proteus  silvia  and julia


proteus

madam  this service i have done for you 
though you respect not aught your servant doth 
to hazard life and rescue you from him
that would have forced your honour and your love 
vouchsafe me  for my meed  but one fair look 
a smaller boon than this i cannot beg
and less than this  i am sure  you cannot give 


valentine

 aside   how like a dream is this i see and hear 
love  lend me patience to forbear awhile 


silvia

o miserable  unhappy that i am 


proteus

unhappy were you  madam  ere i came 
but by my coming i have made you happy 


silvia

by thy approach thou makest me most unhappy 


julia

 aside   and me  when he approacheth to your presence 


silvia

had i been seized by a hungry lion 
i would have been a breakfast to the beast 
rather than have false proteus rescue me 
o  heaven be judge how i love valentine 
whose life as tender to me as my soul 
and full as much  for more there cannot be 
i do detest false perjured proteus 
therefore be gone  solicit me no more 


proteus

what dangerous action  stood it next to death 
would i not undergo for one calm look 
o   the curse in love  and still approved 
when women cannot love where they beloved 


silvia

when proteus cannot love where he beloved 
read over julia heart  thy first best love 
for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
into a thousand oaths  and all those oaths
descended into perjury  to love me 
thou hast no faith left now  unless thou two 
and that far worse than none  better have none
than plural faith which is too much by one 
thou counterfeit to thy true friend 


proteus

in love
who respects friend 


silvia

all men but proteus 


proteus

nay  if the gentle spirit of moving words
can no way change you to a milder form 
i woo you like a soldier  at arms  end 
and love you  the nature of love force ye 


silvia

o heaven 


proteus

        i force thee yield to my desire 


valentine

ruffian  let go that rude uncivil touch 
thou friend of an ill fashion 


proteus

valentine 


valentine

thou common friend  that without faith or love 
for such is a friend now  treacherous man 
thou hast beguiled my hopes  nought but mine eye
could have persuaded me  now i dare not say
i have one friend alive  thou wouldst disprove me 
who should be trusted  when one own right hand
is perjured to the bosom  proteus 
i am sorry i must never trust thee more 
but count the world a stranger for thy sake 
the private wound is deepest  o time most accurst 
 all foes that a friend should be the worst 


proteus

my shame and guilt confounds me 
forgive me  valentine  if hearty sorrow
be a sufficient ransom for offence 
i tender  here  i do as truly suffer
as e i did commit 


valentine

then i am paid 
and once again i do receive thee honest 
who by repentance is not satisfied
is nor of heaven nor earth  for these are pleased 
by penitence the eternal wrath appeased 
and  that my love may appear plain and free 
all that was mine in silvia i give thee 


julia

o me unhappy 
swoons


proteus

look to the boy 


valentine

why  boy  why  wag  how now  what the matter 
look up  speak 


julia

o good sir  my master charged me to deliver a ring
to madam silvia  which  out of my neglect  was never done 


proteus

where is that ring  boy 


julia

here  tis  this is it 


proteus

how  let me see 
why  this is the ring i gave to julia 


julia

o  cry you mercy  sir  i have mistook 
this is the ring you sent to silvia 


proteus

but how camest thou by this ring  at my depart
i gave this unto julia 


julia

and julia herself did give it me 
and julia herself hath brought it hither 


proteus

how  julia 


julia

behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths 
and entertain deeply in her heart 
how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root 
o proteus  let this habit make thee blush 
be thou ashamed that i have took upon me
such an immodest raiment  if shame live
in a disguise of love 
it is the lesser blot  modesty finds 
women to change their shapes than men their minds 


proteus

than men their minds   true 
o heaven  were man
but constant  he were perfect  that one error
fills him with faults  makes him run through all the sins 
inconstancy falls off ere it begins 
what is in silvia face  but i may spy
more fresh in julia with a constant eye 


valentine

come  come  a hand from either 
let me be blest to make this happy close 
 pity two such friends should be long foes 


proteus

bear witness  heaven  i have my wish for ever 


julia

and i mine 
enter outlaws  with duke and thurio


outlaws

a prize  a prize  a prize 


valentine

forbear  forbear  i say  it is my lord the duke 
your grace is welcome to a man disgraced 
banished valentine 


duke

sir valentine 


thurio

yonder is silvia  and silvia mine 


valentine

thurio  give back  or else embrace thy death 
come not within the measure of my wrath 
do not name silvia thine  if once again 
verona shall not hold thee  here she stands 
take but possession of her with a touch 
i dare thee but to breathe upon my love 


thurio

sir valentine  i care not for her  i 
i hold him but a fool that will endanger
his body for a girl that loves him not 
i claim her not  and therefore she is thine 


duke

the more degenerate and base art thou 
to make such means for her as thou hast done
and leave her on such slight conditions 
now  by the honour of my ancestry 
i do applaud thy spirit  valentine 
and think thee worthy of an empress  love 
know then  i here forget all former griefs 
cancel all grudge  repeal thee home again 
plead a new state in thy unrivall merit 
to which i thus subscribe  sir valentine 
thou art a gentleman and well derived 
take thou thy silvia  for thou hast deserved her 


valentine

i thank your grace  the gift hath made me happy 
i now beseech you  for your daughter sake 
to grant one boom that i shall ask of you 


duke

i grant it  for thine own  whate it be 


valentine

these banish men that i have kept withal
are men endued with worthy qualities 
forgive them what they have committed here
and let them be recall from their exile 
they are reformed  civil  full of good
and fit for great employment  worthy lord 


duke

thou hast prevail d  i pardon them and thee 
dispose of them as thou know their deserts 
come  let us go  we will include all jars
with triumphs  mirth and rare solemnity 


valentine

and  as we walk along  i dare be bold
with our discourse to make your grace to smile 
what think you of this page  my lord 


duke

i think the boy hath grace in him  he blushes 


valentine

i warrant you  my lord  more grace than boy 


duke

what mean you by that saying 


valentine

please you  i tell you as we pass along 
that you will wonder what hath fortuned 
come  proteus   your penance but to hear
the story of your loves discovered 
that done  our day of marriage shall be yours 
one feast  one house  one mutual happiness 
exeunt
