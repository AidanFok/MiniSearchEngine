scene i  antechamber in leontes  palace 


enter camillo and archidamus


archidamus

if you shall chance  camillo  to visit bohemia  on
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
foot  you shall see  as i have said  great
difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia 


camillo

i think  this coming summer  the king of sicilia
means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him 


archidamus

wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves  for indeed 


camillo

beseech you 


archidamus

verily  i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge 
we cannot with such magnificence in so rare i know
not what to say  we will give you sleepy drinks 
that your senses  unintelligent of our insufficience 
may  though they cannot praise us  as little accuse
us 


camillo

you pay a great deal too dear for what given freely 


archidamus

believe me  i speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance 


camillo

sicilia cannot show himself over kind to bohemia 
they were trained together in their childhoods  and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection 
which cannot choose but branch now  since their
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society  their encounters 
though not personal  have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts  letters  loving
embassies  that they have seemed to be together 
though absent  shook hands  as over a vast  and
embraced  as it were  from the ends of opposed
winds  the heavens continue their loves 


archidamus

i think there is not in the world either malice or
matter to alter it  you have an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince mamillius  it is a
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
into my note 


camillo

i very well agree with you in the hopes of him  it
is a gallant child  one that indeed physics the
subject  makes old hearts fresh  they that went on
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
see him a man 


archidamus

would they else be content to die 


camillo

yes  if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to live 


archidamus

if the king had no son  they would desire to live
on crutches till he had one 
exeunt
