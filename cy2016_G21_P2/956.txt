nine changes of the watery star hath been
the shepherd note since we have left our throne
without a burthen  time as long again
would be find up  my brother  with our thanks 
and yet we should  for perpetuity 
go hence in debt  and therefore  like a cipher 
yet standing in rich place  i multiply
with one  thank you  many thousands moe
that go before it 


leontes

                  stay your thanks a while 
and pay them when you part 


polixenes

sir  that to morrow 
i am question by my fears  of what may chance
or breed upon our absence  that may blow
no sneaping winds at home  to make us say
 is put forth too truly  besides  i have stay 
to tire your royalty 


leontes

we are tougher  brother 
than you can put us to t 


polixenes

no longer stay 


leontes

one seven night longer 


polixenes

very sooth  to morrow 


leontes

we part the time between then  and in that
i no gainsaying 


polixenes

press me not  beseech you  so 
there is no tongue that moves  none  none i  the world 
so soon as yours could win me  so it should now 
were there necessity in your request  although
 needful i denied it  my affairs
do even drag me homeward  which to hinder
were in your love a whip to me  my stay
to you a charge and trouble  to save both 
farewell  our brother 


leontes

tongue tied  our queen 
speak you 


hermione

i had thought  sir  to have held my peace until
you have drawn oaths from him not to stay  you  sir 
charge him too coldly  tell him  you are sure
all in bohemia well  this satisfaction
the by gone day proclaim d  say this to him 
he beat from his best ward 


leontes

well said  hermione 


hermione

to tell  he longs to see his son  were strong 
but let him say so then  and let him go 
but let him swear so  and he shall not stay 
we thwack him hence with distaffs 
yet of your royal presence i adventure
the borrow of a week  when at bohemia
you take my lord  i give him my commission
to let him there a month behind the gest
prefix for parting  yet  good deed  leontes 
i love thee not a jar o  the clock behind
what lady she her lord  you stay 


polixenes

no  madam 


hermione

nay  but you will 


polixenes

                  i may not  verily 


hermione

verily 
you put me off with limber vows  but i 
though you would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths 
should yet say  sir  no going  verily 
you shall not go  a lady verily   
as potent as a lord s  will you go yet 
force me to keep you as a prisoner 
not like a guest  so you shall pay your fees
when you depart  and save your thanks  how say you 
my prisoner  or my guest  by your dread  verily 
one of them you shall be 


polixenes

your guest  then  madam 
to be your prisoner should import offending 
which is for me less easy to commit
than you to punish 


hermione

not your gaoler  then 
but your kind hostess  come  i question you
of my lord tricks and yours when you were boys 
you were pretty lordings then 


polixenes

we were  fair queen 
two lads that thought there was no more behind
but such a day to morrow as to day 
and to be boy eternal 


hermione

was not my lord
the verier wag o  the two 


polixenes

we were as twinn lambs that did frisk i  the sun 
and bleat the one at the other  what we changed
was innocence for innocence  we knew not
the doctrine of ill doing  nor dream 
that any did  had we pursued that life 
and our weak spirits ne been higher rear 
with stronger blood  we should have answer heaven
boldly  guilty  the imposition clear 
hereditary ours 


hermione

                  by this we gather
you have tripp since 


polixenes

o my most sacred lady 
temptations have since then been born to s  for
in those unfledged days was my wife a girl 
your precious self had then not cross the eyes
of my young play fellow 


hermione

grace to boot 
of this make no conclusion  lest you say
your queen and i are devils  yet go on 
the offences we have made you do we answer 
if you first sinn with us and that with us
you did continue fault and that you slipp not
with any but with us 


leontes

is he won yet 


hermione

he stay my lord 


leontes

at my request he would not 
hermione  my dearest  thou never spokest
to better purpose 


hermione

                                 never 


leontes

never  but once 


hermione

what  have i twice said well  when was before 
i prithee tell me  cram with praise  and make 
as fat as tame things  one good deed dying tongueless
slaughters a thousand waiting upon that 
our praises are our wages  you may ride 
with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
with spur we beat an acre  but to the goal 
my last good deed was to entreat his stay 
what was my first  it has an elder sister 
or i mistake you  o  would her name were grace 
but once before i spoke to the purpose  when 
nay  let me have t  i long 


leontes

why  that was when
three crabbed months had sour themselves to death 
ere i could make thee open thy white hand
and clap thyself my love  then didst thou utter
 am yours for ever 


hermione

 grace indeed 
why  lo you now  i have spoke to the purpose twice 
the one for ever earn a royal husband 
the other for some while a friend 


leontes

 aside 	too hot  too hot 
to mingle friendship far is mingling bloods 
i have tremor cordis on me  my heart dances 
but not for joy  not joy  this entertainment
may a free face put on  derive a liberty
from heartiness  from bounty  fertile bosom 
and well become the agent   may  i grant 
but to be paddling palms and pinching fingers 
as now they are  and making practised smiles 
as in a looking glass  and then to sigh  as  
the mort o  the deer  o  that is entertainment
my bosom likes not  nor my brows  mamillius 
art thou my boy 


mamillius

                           ay  my good lord 


leontes

why  that my bawcock  what  hast
smutch thy nose 
they say it is a copy out of mine  come  captain 
we must be neat  not neat  but cleanly  captain 
and yet the steer  the heifer and the calf
are all call neat still virginalling
upon his palm how now  you wanton calf 
art thou my calf 


mamillius

                  yes  if you will  my lord 


leontes

thou want a rough pash and the shoots that i have 
to be full like me  yet they say we are
almost as like as eggs  women say so 
that will say anything but were they false
as o er dyed blacks  as wind  as waters  false
as dice are to be wish by one that fixes
no bourn  his and mine  yet were it true
to say this boy were like me  come  sir page 
look on me with your welkin eye  sweet villain 
most dear st  my collop  can thy dam may be 
affection  thy intention stabs the centre 
thou dost make possible things not so held 
communicatest with dreams how can this be 
with what unreal thou coactive art 
and fellow nothing  then  very credent
thou mayst co join with something  and thou dost 
and that beyond commission  and i find it 
and that to the infection of my brains
and hardening of my brows 


polixenes

what means sicilia 


hermione

he something seems unsettled 


polixenes

how  my lord 
what cheer  how is with you  best brother 


hermione

you look as if you held a brow of much distraction
are you moved  my lord 


leontes

no  in good earnest 
how sometimes nature will betray its folly 
its tenderness  and make itself a pastime
to harder bosoms  looking on the lines
of my boy face  methoughts i did recoil
twenty three years  and saw myself unbreech d 
in my green velvet coat  my dagger muzzled 
lest it should bite its master  and so prove 
as ornaments oft do  too dangerous 
how like  methought  i then was to this kernel 
this squash  this gentleman  mine honest friend 
will you take eggs for money 


mamillius

no  my lord  i fight 


leontes

are you so fond of your young prince as we
do seem to be of ours 


polixenes

if at home  sir 
he all my exercise  my mirth  my matter 
now my sworn friend and then mine enemy 
my parasite  my soldier  statesman  all 
he makes a july day short as december 
and with his varying childness cures in me
thoughts that would thick my blood 


leontes

so stands this squire
officed with me  we two will walk  my lord 
and leave you to your graver steps  hermione 
how thou lovest us  show in our brother welcome 
let what is dear in sicily be cheap 
next to thyself and my young rover  he 
apparent to my heart 


hermione

if you would seek us 
we are yours i  the garden  shall attend you there 


leontes

to your own bents dispose you  you be found 
be you beneath the sky 
aside
i am angling now 
though you perceive me not how i give line 
go to  go to 
how she holds up the neb  the bill to him 
and arms her with the boldness of a wife
to her allowing husband 
exeunt polixenes  hermione  and attendants
gone already 
inch thick  knee deep  o head and
ears a fork one 
go  play  boy  play  thy mother plays  and i
play too  but so disgraced a part  whose issue
will hiss me to my grave  contempt and clamour
will be my knell  go  play  boy  play 
there have been 
or i am much deceived  cuckolds ere now 
and many a man there is  even at this present 
now while i speak this  holds his wife by the arm 
that little thinks she has been sluiced in absence
and his pond fish by his next neighbour  by
sir smile  his neighbour  nay  there comfort in 
whiles other men have gates and those gates open d 
as mine  against their will  should all despair
that have revolted wives  the tenth of mankind
would hang themselves  physic for there is none 
it is a bawdy planet  that will strike
where  predominant  and  powerful  think it 
from east  west  north and south  be it concluded 
no barricado for a belly  know t 
it will let in and out the enemy
with bag and baggage  many thousand on 
have the disease  and feel not  how now  boy 


mamillius

i am like you  they say 


leontes

why that some comfort  what  camillo there 


camillo

ay  my good lord 


leontes

go play  mamillius  thou an honest man 
exit mamillius
camillo  this great sir will yet stay longer 


camillo

you had much ado to make his anchor hold 
when you cast out  it still came home 


leontes

didst note it 


camillo

he would not stay at your petitions  made
his business more material 


leontes

didst perceive it 
aside
they here with me already  whispering  rounding
 is a so forth   far gone 
when i shall gust it last  how came t  camillo 
that he did stay 


camillo

                  at the good queen entreaty 


leontes

at the queen be t   good  should be pertinent
but  so it is  it is not  was this taken
by any understanding pate but thine 
for thy conceit is soaking  will draw in
more than the common blocks  not noted  is t 
but of the finer natures  by some severals
of head piece extraordinary  lower messes
perchance are to this business purblind  say 


camillo

business  my lord  i think most understand
bohemia stays here longer 


leontes

ha 


camillo

stays here longer 


leontes

ay  but why 


camillo

to satisfy your highness and the entreaties
of our most gracious mistress 


leontes

satisfy 
the entreaties of your mistress  satisfy 
let that suffice  i have trusted thee  camillo 
with all the nearest things to my heart  as well
my chamber councils  wherein  priest like  thou
hast cleansed my bosom  i from thee departed
thy penitent reform d  but we have been
deceived in thy integrity  deceived
in that which seems so 


camillo

be it forbid  my lord 


leontes

to bide upon t  thou art not honest  or 
if thou inclinest that way  thou art a coward 
which hoxes honesty behind  restraining
from course required  or else thou must be counted
a servant grafted in my serious trust
and therein negligent  or else a fool
that seest a game play home  the rich stake drawn 
and takest it all for jest 


camillo

my gracious lord 
i may be negligent  foolish and fearful 
in every one of these no man is free 
but that his negligence  his folly  fear 
among the infinite doings of the world 
sometime puts forth  in your affairs  my lord 
if ever i were wilful negligent 
it was my folly  if industriously
i play the fool  it was my negligence 
not weighing well the end  if ever fearful
to do a thing  where i the issue doubted 
where of the execution did cry out
against the non performance   a fear
which oft infects the wisest  these  my lord 
are such allow infirmities that honesty
is never free of  but  beseech your grace 
be plainer with me  let me know my trespass
by its own visage  if i then deny it 
 none of mine 


leontes

                  ha  not you seen  camillo 
but that past doubt  you have  or your eye glass
is thicker than a cuckold horn or heard 
for to a vision so apparent rumour
cannot be mute or thought for cogitation
resides not in that man that does not think 
my wife is slippery  if thou wilt confess 
or else be impudently negative 
to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought  then say
my wife a hobby horse  deserves a name
as rank as any flax wench that puts to
before her troth plight  say and justify t 


camillo

i would not be a stander by to hear
my sovereign mistress clouded so  without
my present vengeance taken   my heart 
you never spoke what did become you less
than this  which to reiterate were sin
as deep as that  though true 


leontes

is whispering nothing 
is leaning cheek to cheek  is meeting noses 
kissing with inside lip  stopping the career
of laughing with a sigh a note infallible
of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot 
skulking in corners  wishing clocks more swift 
hours  minutes  noon  midnight  and all eyes
blind with the pin and web but theirs  theirs only 
that would unseen be wicked  is this nothing 
why  then the world and all that in is nothing 
the covering sky is nothing  bohemia nothing 
my wife is nothing  nor nothing have these nothings 
if this be nothing 


camillo

good my lord  be cured
of this diseased opinion  and betimes 
for  most dangerous 


leontes

say it be   true 


camillo

no  no  my lord 


leontes

                  it is  you lie  you lie 
i say thou liest  camillo  and i hate thee 
pronounce thee a gross lout  a mindless slave 
or else a hovering temporizer  that
canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil 
inclining to them both  were my wife liver
infected as her life  she would not live
the running of one glass 


camillo

who does infect her 


leontes

why  he that wears her like a medal  hanging
about his neck  bohemia  who  if i
had servants true about me  that bare eyes
to see alike mine honour as their profits 
their own particular thrifts  they would do that
which should undo more doing  ay  and thou 
his cupbearer whom i from meaner form
have benched and reared to worship  who mayst see
plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven 
how i am galled mightst bespice a cup 
to give mine enemy a lasting wink 
which draught to me were cordial 


camillo

sir  my lord 
i could do this  and that with no rash potion 
but with a lingering dram that should not work
maliciously like poison  but i cannot
believe this crack to be in my dread mistress 
so sovereignly being honourable 
i have loved thee 


leontes

make that thy question  and go rot 
dost think i am so muddy  so unsettled 
to appoint myself in this vexation  sully
the purity and whiteness of my sheets 
which to preserve is sleep  which being spotted
is goads  thorns  nettles  tails of wasps 
give scandal to the blood o  the prince my son 
who i do think is mine and love as mine 
without ripe moving to t  would i do this 
could man so blench 


camillo

i must believe you  sir 
i do  and will fetch off bohemia for t 
provided that  when he removed  your highness
will take again your queen as yours at first 
even for your son sake  and thereby for sealing
the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
known and allied to yours 


leontes

thou dost advise me
even so as i mine own course have set down 
i give no blemish to her honour  none 


camillo

my lord 
go then  and with a countenance as clear
as friendship wears at feasts  keep with bohemia
and with your queen  i am his cupbearer 
if from me he have wholesome beverage 
account me not your servant 


leontes

this is all 
do and thou hast the one half of my heart 
do not  thou split thine own 


camillo

i do t  my lord 


leontes

i will seem friendly  as thou hast advised me 
exit


camillo

o miserable lady  but  for me 
what case stand i in  i must be the poisoner
of good polixenes  and my ground to do 
is the obedience to a master  one
who in rebellion with himself will have
all that are his so too  to do this deed 
promotion follows  if i could find example
of thousands that had struck anointed kings
and flourish after  i not do t  but since
nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one 
let villany itself forswear t  i must
forsake the court  to do t  or no  is certain
to me a break neck  happy star  reign now 
here comes bohemia 
re enter polixenes


polixenes

this is strange  methinks
my favour here begins to warp  not speak 
good day  camillo 


camillo

                  hail  most royal sir 


polixenes

what is the news i  the court 


camillo

none rare  my lord 


polixenes

the king hath on him such a countenance
as he had lost some province and a region
loved as he loves himself  even now i met him
with customary compliment  when he 
wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
a lip of much contempt  speeds from me and
so leaves me to consider what is breeding
that changeth thus his manners 


camillo

i dare not know  my lord 


polixenes

how  dare not  do not  do you know  and dare not 
be intelligent to me   thereabouts 
for  to yourself  what you do know  you must 
and cannot say  you dare not  good camillo 
your changed complexions are to me a mirror
which shows me mine changed too  for i must be
a party in this alteration  finding
myself thus alter with  t 


camillo

there is a sickness
which puts some of us in distemper  but
i cannot name the disease  and it is caught
of you that yet are well 


polixenes

how  caught of me 
make me not sighted like the basilisk 
i have look on thousands  who have sped the better
by my regard  but kill none so  camillo 
as you are certainly a gentleman  thereto
clerk like experienced  which no less adorns
our gentry than our parents  noble names 
in whose success we are gentle i beseech you 
if you know aught which does behove my knowledge
thereof to be inform d  imprison not
in ignorant concealment 


camillo

i may not answer 


polixenes

a sickness caught of me  and yet i well 
i must be answer d  dost thou hear  camillo 
i conjure thee  by all the parts of man
which honour does acknowledge  whereof the least
is not this suit of mine  that thou declare
what incidency thou dost guess of harm
is creeping toward me  how far off  how near 
which way to be prevented  if to be 
if not  how best to bear it 


camillo

sir  i will tell you 
since i am charged in honour and by him
that i think honourable  therefore mark my counsel 
which must be even as swiftly follow as
i mean to utter it  or both yourself and me
cry lost  and so good night 


polixenes

on  good camillo 


camillo

i am appointed him to murder you 


polixenes

by whom  camillo 


camillo

                        by the king 


polixenes

for what 


camillo

he thinks  nay  with all confidence he swears 
as he had seen or been an instrument
to vice you to t  that you have touch his queen
forbiddenly 


polixenes

                  o  then my best blood turn
to an infected jelly and my name
be yoked with his that did betray the best 
turn then my freshest reputation to
a savour that may strike the dullest nostril
where i arrive  and my approach be shunn d 
nay  hated too  worse than the great infection
that e was heard or read 


camillo

swear his thought over
by each particular star in heaven and
by all their influences  you may as well
forbid the sea for to obey the moon
as or by oath remove or counsel shake
the fabric of his folly  whose foundation
is piled upon his faith and will continue
the standing of his body 


polixenes

how should this grow 


camillo

i know not  but i am sure  safer to
avoid what grown than question how  born 
if therefore you dare trust my honesty 
that lies enclosed in this trunk which you
shall bear along impawn d  away to night 
your followers i will whisper to the business 
and will by twos and threes at several posterns
clear them o  the city  for myself  i put
my fortunes to your service  which are here
by this discovery lost  be not uncertain 
for  by the honour of my parents  i
have utter truth  which if you seek to prove 
i dare not stand by  nor shall you be safer
than one condemn by the king own mouth  thereon
his execution sworn 


polixenes

i do believe thee 
i saw his heart in  face  give me thy hand 
be pilot to me and thy places shall
still neighbour mine  my ships are ready and
my people did expect my hence departure
two days ago  this jealousy
is for a precious creature  as she rare 
must it be great  and as his person mighty 
must it be violent  and as he does conceive
he is dishonour by a man which ever
profess to him  why  his revenges must
in that be made more bitter  fear o me 
good expedition be my friend  and comfort
the gracious queen  part of his theme  but nothing
of his ill ta suspicion  come  camillo 
i will respect thee as a father if
thou bear my life off hence  let us avoid 


camillo

it is in mine authority to command
the keys of all the posterns  please your highness
to take the urgent hour  come  sir  away
