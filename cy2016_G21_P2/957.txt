mamillius

your brows are blacker  yet black brows  they say

too much hair there  but in a semicircle
or a half moon made with a pen

yond crickets shall not hear it 


hermione

come on  then 
and give me in mine ear 
enter leontes  with antigonus  lords and others


leontes

was he met there  his train  camillo with him 


first lord

behind the tuft of pines i met them  never
saw i men scour so on their way  i eyed them
even to their ships 


leontes

how blest am i
in my just censure  in my true opinion 
alack  for lesser knowledge  how accursed
in being so blest  there may be in the cup
a spider steep d  and one may drink  depart 
and yet partake no venom  for his knowledge
is not infected  but if one present
the abhorr ingredient to his eye  make known
how he hath drunk  he cracks his gorge  his sides 
with violent hefts  i have drunk 
and seen the spider 
camillo was his help in this  his pander 
there is a plot against my life  my crown 
all true that is mistrusted  that false villain
whom i employ was pre employ by him 
he has discover my design  and i
remain a pinch thing  yea  a very trick
for them to play at will  how came the posterns
so easily open 


first lord

                  by his great authority 
which often hath no less prevail than so
on your command 


leontes

                          i know too well 
give me the boy  i am glad you did not nurse him 
though he does bear some signs of me  yet you
have too much blood in him 


hermione

what is this  sport 


leontes

bear the boy hence  he shall not come about her 
away with him  and let her sport herself
with that she big with  for  polixenes
has made thee swell thus 


hermione

but i say he had not 
and i be sworn you would believe my saying 
howe you lean to the nayward 


leontes

you  my lords 
look on her  mark her well  be but about
to say  is a goodly lady  and
the justice of your bearts will thereto add
 pity she not honest  honourable 
praise her but for this her without door form 
which on my faith deserves high speech  and straight
the shrug  the hum or ha  these petty brands
that calumny doth use o  i am out 
that mercy does  for calumny will sear
virtue itself  these shrugs  these hums and ha s 
when you have said  she goodly  come between
ere you can say  she honest  but be  known 
from him that has most cause to grieve it should be 
she an adulteress 


hermione

should a villain say so 
the most replenish villain in the world 
he were as much more villain  you  my lord 
do but mistake 


leontes

                  you have mistook  my lady 
polixenes for leontes  o thou thing 
which i not call a creature of thy place 
lest barbarism  making me the precedent 
should a like language use to all degrees
and mannerly distinguishment leave out
betwixt the prince and beggar  i have said
she an adulteress  i have said with whom 
more  she a traitor and camillo is
a federary with her  and one that knows
what she should shame to know herself
but with her most vile principal  that she 
a bed swerver  even as bad as those
that vulgars give bold titles  ay  and privy
to this their late escape 


hermione

no  by my life 
privy to none of this  how will this grieve you 
when you shall come to clearer knowledge  that
you thus have publish me  gentle my lord 
you scarce can right me throughly then to say
you did mistake 


leontes

                  no  if i mistake
in those foundations which i build upon 
the centre is not big enough to bear
a school boy top  away with her  to prison 
he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
but that he speaks 


hermione

there some ill planet reigns 
i must be patient till the heavens look
with an aspect more favourable  good my lords 
i am not prone to weeping  as our sex
commonly are  the want of which vain dew
perchance shall dry your pities  but i have
that honourable grief lodged here which burns
worse than tears drown  beseech you all  my lords 
with thoughts so qualified as your charities
shall best instruct you  measure me  and so
the king will be perform d 


leontes

shall i be heard 


hermione

who is that goes with me  beseech your highness 
my women may be with me  for you see
my plight requires it  do not weep  good fools 
there is no cause  when you shall know your mistress
has deserved prison  then abound in tears
as i come out  this action i now go on
is for my better grace  adieu  my lord 
i never wish to see you sorry  now
i trust i shall  my women  come  you have leave 


leontes

go  do our bidding  hence 
exit hermione  guarded  with ladies


first lord

beseech your highness  call the queen again 


antigonus

be certain what you do  sir  lest your justice
prove violence  in the which three great ones suffer 
yourself  your queen  your son 


first lord

for her  my lord 
i dare my life lay down and will do t  sir 
please you to accept it  that the queen is spotless
i  the eyes of heaven and to you  i mean 
in this which you accuse her 


antigonus

if it prove
she otherwise  i keep my stables where
i lodge my wife  i go in couples with her 
than when i feel and see her no farther trust her 
for every inch of woman in the world 
ay  every dram of woman flesh is false  if she be 


leontes

         hold your peaces 


first lord

good my lord 


antigonus

it is for you we speak  not for ourselves 
you are abused and by some putter on
that will be damn for t  would i knew the villain 
i would land damn him  be she honour flaw d 
i have three daughters  the eldest is eleven
the second and the third  nine  and some five 
if this prove true  they pay for t 
by mine honour 
i geld  all  fourteen they shall not see 
to bring false generations  they are co heirs 
and i had rather glib myself than they
should not produce fair issue 


leontes

cease  no more 
you smell this business with a sense as cold
as is a dead man nose  but i do see and feel 
as you feel doing thus  and see withal
the instruments that feel 


antigonus

if it be so 
we need no grave to bury honesty 
there not a grain of it the face to sweeten
of the whole dungy earth 


leontes

what  lack i credit 


first lord

i had rather you did lack than i  my lord 
upon this ground  and more it would content me
to have her honour true than your suspicion 
be blamed for how you might 


leontes

why  what need we
commune with you of this  but rather follow
our forceful instigation  our prerogative
calls not your counsels  but our natural goodness
imparts this  which if you  or stupefied
or seeming so in skill  cannot or will not
relish a truth like us  inform yourselves
we need no more of your advice  the matter 
the loss  the gain  the ordering on t  is all
properly ours 


antigonus

                  and i wish  my liege 
you had only in your silent judgment tried it 
without more overture 


leontes

how could that be 
either thou art most ignorant by age 
or thou wert born a fool  camillo flight 
added to their familiarity 
which was as gross as ever touch conjecture 
that lack sight only  nought for approbation
but only seeing  all other circumstances
made up to the deed  doth push on this proceeding 
yet  for a greater confirmation 
for in an act of this importance  
most piteous to be wild  i have dispatch in post
to sacred delphos  to apollo temple 
cleomenes and dion  whom you know
of stuff sufficiency  now from the oracle
they will bring all  whose spiritual counsel had 
shall stop or spur me  have i done well 


first lord

well done  my lord 


leontes

though i am satisfied and need no more
than what i know  yet shall the oracle
give rest to the minds of others  such as he
whose ignorant credulity will not
come up to the truth  so have we thought it good
from our free person she should be confined 
lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
be left her to perform  come  follow us 
we are to speak in public  for this business
will raise us all 


antigonus

 aside 
to laughter  as i take it 
if the good truth were known 
exeunt
