scene iii  a room in leontes  palace 


enter leontes  antigonus  lords  and servants


leontes

nor night nor day no rest  it is but weakness
to bear the matter thus  mere weakness  if
the cause were not in being part o  the cause 
she the adulteress  for the harlot king
is quite beyond mine arm  out of the blank
and level of my brain  plot proof  but she
i can hook to me  say that she were gone 
given to the fire  a moiety of my rest
might come to me again  who there 


first servant

my lord 


leontes

how does the boy 


first servant

                  he took good rest to night 
 hoped his sickness is discharged 


leontes

to see his nobleness 
conceiving the dishonour of his mother 
he straight declined  droop d  took it deeply 
fasten and fix the shame on in himself 
threw off his spirit  his appetite  his sleep 
and downright languish d  leave me solely  go 
see how he fares 
exit servant
fie  fie  no thought of him 
the thought of my revenges that way
recoil upon me  in himself too mighty 
and in his parties  his alliance  let him be
until a time may serve  for present vengeance 
take it on her  camillo and polixenes
laugh at me  make their pastime at my sorrow 
they should not laugh if i could reach them  nor
shall she within my power 
enter paulina  with a child


first lord

you must not enter 


paulina

nay  rather  good my lords  be second to me 
fear you his tyrannous passion more  alas 
than the queen life  a gracious innocent soul 
more free than he is jealous 


antigonus

that enough 


second servant

madam  he hath not slept tonight  commanded
none should come at him 


paulina

not so hot  good sir 
i come to bring him sleep   such as you 
that creep like shadows by him and do sigh
at each his needless heavings  such as you
nourish the cause of his awaking  i
do come with words as medicinal as true 
honest as either  to purge him of that humour
that presses him from sleep 


leontes

what noise there  ho 


paulina

no noise  my lord  but needful conference
about some gossips for your highness 


leontes

how 
away with that audacious lady  antigonus 
i charged thee that she should not come about me 
i knew she would 


antigonus

                  i told her so  my lord 
on your displeasure peril and on mine 
she should not visit you 


leontes

what  canst not rule her 


paulina

from all dishonesty he can  in this 
unless he take the course that you have done 
commit me for committing honour  trust it 
he shall not rule me 


antigonus

la you now  you hear 
when she will take the rein i let her run 
but she not stumble 


paulina

good my liege  i come 
and  i beseech you  hear me  who profess
myself your loyal servant  your physician 
your most obedient counsellor  yet that dare
less appear so in comforting your evils 
than such as most seem yours  i say  i come
from your good queen 


leontes

good queen 


paulina

good queen  my lord 
good queen  i say good queen 
and would by combat make her good  so were i
a man  the worst about you 


leontes

force her hence 


paulina

let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
first hand me  on mine own accord i off 
but first i do my errand  the good queen 
for she is good  hath brought you forth a daughter 
here  tis  commends it to your blessing 
laying down the child


leontes

out 
a mankind witch  hence with her  out o  door 
a most intelligencing bawd 


paulina

not so 
i am as ignorant in that as you
in so entitling me  and no less honest
than you are mad  which is enough  i warrant 
as this world goes  to pass for honest 


leontes

traitors 
will you not push her out  give her the bastard 
thou dotard  thou art woman tired  unroosted
by thy dame partlet here  take up the bastard 
take up  i say  give to thy crone 


paulina

for ever
unvenerable be thy hands  if thou
takest up the princess by that forced baseness
which he has put upon t 


leontes

he dreads his wife 


paulina

so i would you did  then  past all doubt
you call your children yours 


leontes

a nest of traitors 


antigonus

i am none  by this good light 


paulina

nor i  nor any
but one that here  and that himself  for he
the sacred honour of himself  his queen s 
his hopeful son s  his babe s  betrays to slander 
whose sting is sharper than the sword s 
and will not 
for  as the case now stands  it is a curse
he cannot be compell to t once remove
the root of his opinion  which is rotten
as ever oak or stone was sound 


leontes

a callat
of boundless tongue  who late hath beat her husband
and now baits me  this brat is none of mine 
it is the issue of polixenes 
hence with it  and together with the dam
commit them to the fire 


paulina

it is yours 
and  might we lay the old proverb to your charge 
so like you   the worse  behold  my lords 
although the print be little  the whole matter
and copy of the father  eye  nose  lip 
the trick of frown  his forehead  nay  the valley 
the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek 
his smiles 
the very mould and frame of hand  nail  finger 
and thou  good goddess nature  which hast made it
so like to him that got it  if thou hast
the ordering of the mind too   all colours
no yellow in t  lest she suspect  as he does 
her children not her husband s 


leontes

a gross hag
and  lozel  thou art worthy to be hang d 
that wilt not stay her tongue 


antigonus

hang all the husbands
that cannot do that feat  you leave yourself
hardly one subject 


leontes

once more  take her hence 


paulina

a most unworthy and unnatural lord
can do no more 


leontes

                  i ha  thee burnt 


paulina

i care not 
it is an heretic that makes the fire 
not she which burns in t  i not call you tyrant 
but this most cruel usage of your queen 
not able to produce more accusation
than your own weak hinged fancy  something savours
of tyranny and will ignoble make you 
yea  scandalous to the world 


leontes

on your allegiance 
out of the chamber with her  were i a tyrant 
where were her life  she durst not call me so 
if she did know me one  away with her 


paulina

i pray you  do not push me  i be gone 
look to your babe  my lord   yours 
jove send her
a better guiding spirit  what needs these hands 
you  that are thus so tender o his follies 
will never do him good  not one of you 
so  so  farewell  we are gone 
exit


leontes

thou  traitor  hast set on thy wife to this 
my child  away with t  even thou  that hast
a heart so tender o it  take it hence
and see it instantly consumed with fire 
even thou and none but thou  take it up straight 
within this hour bring me word  done 
and by good testimony  or i seize thy life 
with what thou else call thine  if thou refuse
and wilt encounter with my wrath  say so 
the bastard brains with these my proper hands
shall i dash out  go  take it to the fire 
for thou set on thy wife 


antigonus

i did not  sir 
these lords  my noble fellows  if they please 
can clear me in t 


lords

                  we can  my royal liege 
he is not guilty of her coming hither 


leontes

you liars all 


first lord

beseech your highness  give us better credit 
we have always truly served you  and beseech you
so to esteem of us  and on our knees we beg 
as recompense of our dear services
past and to come  that you do change this purpose 
which being so horrible  so bloody  must
lead on to some foul issue  we all kneel 


leontes

i am a feather for each wind that blows 
shall i live on to see this bastard kneel
and call me father  better burn it now
than curse it then  but be it  let it live 
it shall not neither  you  sir  come you hither 
you that have been so tenderly officious
with lady margery  your midwife there 
to save this bastard life for  a bastard 
so sure as this beard grey 
 what will you adventure
to save this brat life 


antigonus

any thing  my lord 
that my ability may undergo
and nobleness impose  at least thus much 
i pawn the little blood which i have left
to save the innocent  any thing possible 


leontes

it shall be possible  swear by this sword
thou wilt perform my bidding 


antigonus

i will  my lord 


leontes

mark and perform it  see thou  for the fail
of any point in shall not only be
death to thyself but to thy lewd tongued wife 
whom for this time we pardon  we enjoin thee 
as thou art liege man to us  that thou carry
this female bastard hence and that thou bear it
to some remote and desert place quite out
of our dominions  and that there thou leave it 
without more mercy  to its own protection
and favour of the climate  as by strange fortune
it came to us  i do in justice charge thee 
on thy soul peril and thy body torture 
that thou commend it strangely to some place
where chance may nurse or end it  take it up 


antigonus

i swear to do this  though a present death
had been more merciful  come on  poor babe 
some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
to be thy nurses  wolves and bears  they say
casting their savageness aside have done
like offices of pity  sir  be prosperous
in more than this deed does require  and blessing
against this cruelty fight on thy side 
poor thing  condemn to loss 
exit with the child


leontes

no  i not rear
another issue 
enter a servant


servant

                  please your highness  posts
from those you sent to the oracle are come
an hour since  cleomenes and dion 
being well arrived from delphos  are both landed 
hasting to the court 


first lord

so please you  sir  their speed
hath been beyond account 


leontes

twenty three days
they have been absent   good speed  foretells
the great apollo suddenly will have
the truth of this appear  prepare you  lords 
summon a session  that we may arraign
our most disloyal lady  for  as she hath
been publicly accused  so shall she have
a just and open trial  while she lives
my heart will be a burthen to me  leave me 
and think upon my bidding
