scene i  a sea port in sicilia 


enter cleomenes and dion


cleomenes

the climate delicate  the air most sweet 
fertile the isle  the temple much surpassing
the common praise it bears 


dion

i shall report 
for most it caught me  the celestial habits 
methinks i so should term them  and the reverence
of the grave wearers  o  the sacrifice 
how ceremonious  solemn and unearthly
it was i  the offering 


cleomenes

but of all  the burst
and the ear deafening voice o  the oracle 
kin to jove thunder  so surprised my sense 
that i was nothing 


dion

if the event o  the journey
prove as successful to the queen o be so 
as it hath been to us rare  pleasant  speedy 
the time is worth the use on t 


cleomenes

great apollo
turn all to the best  these proclamations 
so forcing faults upon hermione 
i little like 


dion

                  the violent carriage of it
will clear or end the business  when the oracle 
thus by apollo great divine seal up 
shall the contents discover  something rare
even then will rush to knowledge  go  fresh horses 
and gracious be the issue 
exeunt
