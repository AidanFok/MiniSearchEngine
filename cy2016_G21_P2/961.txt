scene ii  a court of justice 


enter leontes  lords  and officers


leontes

this sessions  to our great grief we pronounce 
even pushes  our heart  the party tried
the daughter of a king  our wife  and one
of us too much beloved  let us be clear 
of being tyrannous  since we so openly
proceed in justice  which shall have due course 
even to the guilt or the purgation 
produce the prisoner 


officer

it is his highness  pleasure that the queen
appear in person here in court  silence 
enter hermione guarded  paulina and ladies attending


leontes

read the indictment 


officer

 reads             hermione  queen to the worthy
leontes  king of sicilia  thou art here accused and
arraigned of high treason  in committing adultery
with polixenes  king of bohemia  and conspiring
with camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
lord the king  thy royal husband  the pretence
whereof being by circumstances partly laid open 
thou  hermione  contrary to the faith and allegiance
of a true subject  didst counsel and aid them  for
their better safety  to fly away by night 


hermione

since what i am to say must be but that
which contradicts my accusation and
the testimony on my part no other
but what comes from myself  it shall scarce boot me
to say  guilty  mine integrity
being counted falsehood  shall  as i express it 
be so received  but thus  if powers divine
behold our human actions  as they do 
i doubt not then but innocence shall make
false accusation blush and tyranny
tremble at patience  you  my lord  best know 
who least will seem to do so  my past life
hath been as continent  as chaste  as true 
as i am now unhappy  which is more
than history can pattern  though devised
and play to take spectators  for behold me
a fellow of the royal bed  which owe
a moiety of the throne a great king daughter 
the mother to a hopeful prince  here standing
to prate and talk for life and honour  
who please to come and hear  for life  i prize it
as i weigh grief  which i would spare  for honour 
 a derivative from me to mine 
and only that i stand for  i appeal
to your own conscience  sir  before polixenes
came to your court  how i was in your grace 
how merited to be so  since he came 
with what encounter so uncurrent i
have strain to appear thus  if one jot beyond
the bound of honour  or in act or will
that way inclining  harden be the hearts
of all that hear me  and my near of kin
cry fie upon my grave 


leontes

i ne heard yet
that any of these bolder vices wanted
less impudence to gainsay what they did
than to perform it first 


hermione

that true enough 
through  a saying  sir  not due to me 


leontes

you will not own it 


hermione

more than mistress of
which comes to me in name of fault  i must not
at all acknowledge  for polixenes 
with whom i am accused  i do confess
i loved him as in honour he required 
with such a kind of love as might become
a lady like me  with a love even such 
so and no other  as yourself commanded 
which not to have done i think had been in me
both disobedience and ingratitude
to you and toward your friend  whose love had spoke 
even since it could speak  from an infant  freely
that it was yours  now  for conspiracy 
i know not how it tastes  though it be dish 
for me to try how  all i know of it
is that camillo was an honest man 
and why he left your court  the gods themselves 
wotting no more than i  are ignorant 


leontes

you knew of his departure  as you know
what you have underta to do in absence 


hermione

sir 
you speak a language that i understand not 
my life stands in the level of your dreams 
which i lay down 


leontes

your actions are my dreams 
you had a bastard by polixenes 
and i but dream it  as you were past all shame 
those of your fact are so so past all truth 
which to deny concerns more than avails  for as
thy brat hath been cast out  like to itself 
no father owning it which is  indeed 
more criminal in thee than it so thou
shalt feel our justice  in whose easiest passage
look for no less than death 


hermione

sir  spare your threats 
the bug which you would fright me with i seek 
to me can life be no commodity 
the crown and comfort of my life  your favour 
i do give lost  for i do feel it gone 
but know not how it went  my second joy
and first fruits of my body  from his presence
i am barr d  like one infectious  my third comfort
starr most unluckily  is from my breast 
the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth 
haled out to murder  myself on every post
proclaimed a strumpet  with immodest hatred
the child bed privilege denied  which  
to women of all fashion  lastly  hurried
here to this place  i  the open air  before
i have got strength of limit  now  my liege 
tell me what blessings i have here alive 
that i should fear to die  therefore proceed 
but yet hear this  mistake me not  no life 
i prize it not a straw  but for mine honour 
which i would free  if i shall be condemn 
upon surmises  all proofs sleeping else
but what your jealousies awake  i tell you
 rigor and not law  your honours all 
i do refer me to the oracle 
apollo be my judge 


first lord

this your request
is altogether just  therefore bring forth 
and in apollos name  his oracle 
exeunt certain officers


hermione

the emperor of russia was my father 
o that he were alive  and here beholding
his daughter trial  that he did but see
the flatness of my misery  yet with eyes
of pity  not revenge 
re enter officers  with cleomenes and dion


officer

you here shall swear upon this sword of justice 
that you  cleomenes and dion  have
been both at delphos  and from thence have brought
the seal d up oracle  by the hand deliver 
of great apollo priest  and that  since then 
you have not dared to break the holy seal
nor read the secrets in t 


cleomenes

dion

all this we swear 


leontes

break up the seals and read 


officer

 reads 	hermione is chaste 
polixenes blameless  camillo a true subject  leontes
a jealous tyrant  his innocent babe truly begotten 
and the king shall live without an heir  if that
which is lost be not found 


lords

now blessed be the great apollo 


hermione

praised 


leontes

hast thou read truth 


officer

ay  my lord  even so
as it is here set down 


leontes

there is no truth at all i  the oracle 
the sessions shall proceed  this is mere falsehood 
enter servant


servant

my lord the king  the king 


leontes

what is the business 


servant

o sir  i shall be hated to report it 
the prince your son  with mere conceit and fear
of the queen speed  is gone 


leontes

how  gone 


servant

is dead 


leontes

apollo angry  and the heavens themselves
do strike at my injustice 
hermione swoons
how now there 


paulina

this news is mortal to the queen  look down
and see what death is doing 


leontes

take her hence 
her heart is but o ercharged  she will recover 
i have too much believed mine own suspicion 
beseech you  tenderly apply to her
some remedies for life 
exeunt paulina and ladies  with hermione
apollo  pardon
my great profaneness  thine oracle 
i reconcile me to polixenes 
new woo my queen  recall the good camillo 
whom i proclaim a man of truth  of mercy 
for  being transported by my jealousies
to bloody thoughts and to revenge  i chose
camillo for the minister to poison
my friend polixenes  which had been done 
but that the good mind of camillo tardied
my swift command  though i with death and with
reward did threaten and encourage him 
not doing  and being done  he  most humane
and fill with honour  to my kingly guest
unclasp my practise  quit his fortunes here 
which you knew great  and to the hazard
of all encertainties himself commended 
no richer than his honour  how he glisters
thorough my rust  and how his pity
does my deeds make the blacker 
re enter paulina


paulina

woe the while 
o  cut my lace  lest my heart  cracking it 
break too 


first lord

          what fit is this  good lady 


paulina

what studied torments  tyrant  hast for me 
what wheels  racks  fires  what flaying  boiling 
in leads or oils  what old or newer torture
must i receive  whose every word deserves
to taste of thy most worst  thy tyranny
together working with thy jealousies 
fancies too weak for boys  too green and idle
for girls of nine  o  think what they have done
and then run mad indeed  stark mad  for all
thy by gone fooleries were but spices of it 
that thou betray polixenes nothing 
that did but show thee  of a fool  inconstant
and damnable ingrateful  nor was much 
thou wouldst have poison good camillo honour 
to have him kill a king  poor trespasses 
more monstrous standing by  whereof i reckon
the casting forth to crows thy baby daughter
to be or none or little  though a devil
would have shed water out of fire ere done t 
nor is directly laid to thee  the death
of the young prince  whose honourable thoughts 
thoughts high for one so tender  cleft the heart
that could conceive a gross and foolish sire
blemish his gracious dam  this is not  no 
laid to thy answer  but the last o lords 
when i have said  cry  woe  the queen  the queen 
the sweet st  dear creature dead 
and vengeance for 
not dropp down yet 


first lord

the higher powers forbid 


paulina

i say she dead  i swear t  if word nor oath
prevail not  go and see  if you can bring
tincture or lustre in her lip  her eye 
heat outwardly or breath within  i serve you
as i would do the gods  but  o thou tyrant 
do not repent these things  for they are heavier
than all thy woes can stir  therefore betake thee
to nothing but despair  a thousand knees
ten thousand years together  naked  fasting 
upon a barren mountain and still winter
in storm perpetual  could not move the gods
to look that way thou wert 


leontes

go on  go on
thou canst not speak too much  i have deserved
all tongues to talk their bitterest 


first lord

say no more 
howe the business goes  you have made fault
i  the boldness of your speech 


paulina

i am sorry for t 
all faults i make  when i shall come to know them 
i do repent  alas  i have show too much
the rashness of a woman  he is touch 
to the noble heart  what gone and what past help
should be past grief  do not receive affliction
at my petition  i beseech you  rather
let me be punish d  that have minded you
of what you should forget  now  good my liege
sir  royal sir  forgive a foolish woman 
the love i bore your queen lo  fool again 
i speak of her no more  nor of your children 
i not remember you of my own lord 
who is lost too  take your patience to you 
and i say nothing 


leontes

thou didst speak but well
when most the truth  which i receive much better
than to be pitied of thee  prithee  bring me
to the dead bodies of my queen and son 
one grave shall be for both  upon them shall
the causes of their death appear  unto
our shame perpetual  once a day i visit
the chapel where they lie  and tears shed there
shall be my recreation  so long as nature
will bear up with this exercise  so long
i daily vow to use it  come and lead me
unto these sorrows 
exeunt
