autolycus

when daffodils begin to peer 
with heigh  the doxy over the dale 
why  then comes in the sweet o  the year 
for the red blood reigns in the winter pale 
the white sheet bleaching on the hedge 
with heigh  the sweet birds  o  how they sing 
doth set my pugging tooth on edge 
for a quart of ale is a dish for a king 
the lark  that tirra lyra chants 
with heigh  with heigh  the thrush and the jay 
are summer songs for me and my aunts 
while we lie tumbling in the hay 
i have served prince florizel and in my time
wore three pile  but now i am out of service 
but shall i go mourn for that  my dear 
the pale moon shines by night 
and when i wander here and there 
i then do most go right 
if tinkers may have leave to live 
and bear the sow skin budget 
then my account i well may  give 
and in the stocks avouch it 
my traffic is sheets  when the kite builds  look to
lesser linen  my father named me autolycus  who
being  as i am  littered under mercury  was likewise
a snapper up of unconsidered trifles  with die and
drab i purchased this caparison  and my revenue is
the silly cheat  gallows and knock are too powerful
on the highway  beating and hanging are terrors to
me  for the life to come  i sleep out the thought
of it  a prize  a prize 
enter clown


clown

yields pound and odd shilling  fifteen hundred

i to buy for our sheep shearing feast  three pound
of sugar  five pound of currants  rice what will
this sister of mine do with rice  but my father
hath made her mistress of the feast  and she lays it
on  she hath made me four and twenty nose gays for
the shearers  three man song men all  and very good
ones  but they are most of them means and bases  but
one puritan amongst them  and he sings psalms to
horn pipes  i must have saffron to colour the warden
pies  mace  dates none  that out of my note 
nutmegs  seven  a race or two of ginger  but that i
may beg  four pound of prunes  and as many of
raisins o  the sun

grovelling on the ground


clown

autolycus

o  help me  help me  pluck but off these rags  and
then  death  death 


clown

alack  poor soul  thou hast need of more rags to lay
on thee  rather than have these off 


autolycus

o sir  the loathsomeness of them offends me more
than the stripes i have received  which are mighty
ones and millions 


clown

alas  poor man  a million of beating may come to a
great matter 


autolycus

i am robbed  sir  and beaten  my money and apparel
ta from me  and these detestable things put upon
me 


clown

what  by a horseman  or a footman 


autolycus

a footman  sweet sir  a footman 


clown

indeed  he should be a footman by the garments he
has left with thee  if this be a horseman coat 
it hath seen very hot service  lend me thy hand 
i help thee  come  lend me thy hand 


autolycus

o  good sir  tenderly  o

shoulder blade is out

 picking his pocket 
softly  dear sir  good sir  softly  you ha  done me
a charitable office 


clown

dost lack any money  i have a little money for thee 


autolycus

a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence 
unto whom i was going  i shall there have money  or
any thing i want  offer me no money  i pray you 
that kills my heart 


clown

what manner of fellow was he that robbed you 


autolycus

a fellow  sir  that i have known to go about with
troll my dames  i knew him once a servant of the
prince  i cannot tell  good sir  for which of his
virtues it was  but he was certainly whipped out of the court 


clown

his vices  you would say  there no virtue whipped
out of the court  they cherish it to make it stay
there  and yet it will no more but abide 


autolycus

vices  i would say  sir  i know this man well  he
hath been since an ape bearer  then a
process server  a bailiff  then he compassed a
motion of the prodigal son  and married a tinker 
wife within a mile where my land and living lies 
and  having flown over many knavish professions  he
settled only in rogue  some call him autolycus 


clown

out upon him  prig  for my life  prig  he haunts
wakes  fairs and bear baitings 


autolycus

very true  sir  he  sir  he  that the rogue that
put me into this apparel 


clown

not a more cowardly rogue in all bohemia  if you had
but looked big and spit at him  he have run 


autolycus

i must confess to you  sir  i am no fighter  i am
false of heart that way  and that he knew  i warrant
him 


clown

how do you now 


autolycus

sweet sir  much better than i was  i can stand and
walk  i will even take my leave of you  and pace
softly towards my kinsman s 


clown

shall i bring thee on the way 


autolycus

no  good faced sir  no  sweet sir 


clown

then fare thee well  i must go buy spices for our
sheep shearing 


autolycus

i be with you at your sheep shearing too  if i
make not this cheat bring out another and the
shearers prove sheep  let me be unrolled and my name
put in the book of virtue 
sings
jog on  jog on  the foot path way 
and merrily hent the stile a
