florizel

these your unusual weeds to each part of you
do give a life  no shepherdess  but flora
peering in april front  this your sheep shearing
is as a meeting of the petty gods 
and you the queen on t 


perdita

sir  my gracious lord 
to chide at your extremes it not becomes me 
o  pardon  that i name them  your high self 
the gracious mark o  the land  you have obscured
with a swain wearing  and me  poor lowly maid 
most goddess like prank up  but that our feasts
in every mess have folly and the feeders
digest it with a custom  i should blush
to see you so attired  sworn  i think 
to show myself a glass 


florizel

i bless the time
when my good falcon made her flight across
thy father ground 


perdita

now jove afford you cause 
to me the difference forges dread  your greatness
hath not been used to fear  even now i tremble
to think your father  by some accident 
should pass this way as you did  o  the fates 
how would he look  to see his work so noble
vilely bound up  what would he say  or how
should i  in these my borrow flaunts  behold
the sternness of his presence 


florizel

apprehend
nothing but jollity  the gods themselves 
humbling their deities to love  have taken
the shapes of beasts upon them  jupiter
became a bull  and bellow d  the green neptune
a ram  and bleated  and the fire robed god 
golden apollo  a poor humble swain 
as i seem now  their transformations
were never for a piece of beauty rarer 
nor in a way so chaste  since my desires
run not before mine honour  nor my lusts
burn hotter than my faith 


perdita

o  but  sir 
your resolution cannot hold  when  
opposed  as it must be  by the power of the king 
one of these two must be necessities 
which then will speak  that you must
change this purpose 
or i my life 


florizel

                  thou dearest perdita 
with these forced thoughts  i prithee  darken not
the mirth o  the feast  or i be thine  my fair 
or not my father s  for i cannot be
mine own  nor any thing to any  if
i be not thine  to this i am most constant 
though destiny say no  be merry  gentle 
strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
that you behold the while  your guests are coming 
lift up your countenance  as it were the day
of celebration of that nuptial which
we two have sworn shall come 


perdita

o lady fortune 
stand you auspicious 


florizel

see  your guests approach 
address yourself to entertain them sprightly 
and let be red with mirth 
enter shepherd  clown  mopsa  dorcas  and others  with polixenes and camillo disguised


shepherd

fie  daughter  when my old wife lived  upon
this day she was both pantler  butler  cook 
both dame and servant  welcomed all  served all 
would sing her song and dance her turn  now here 
at upper end o  the table  now i  the middle 
on his shoulder  and his  her face o  fire
with labour and the thing she took to quench it 
she would to each one sip  you are retired 
as if you were a feasted one and not
the hostess of the meeting  pray you  bid
these unknown friends to welcome  for it is
a way to make us better friends  more known 
come  quench your blushes and present yourself
that which you are  mistress o  the feast  come on 
and bid us welcome to your sheep shearing 
as your good flock shall prosper 


perdita

 to polixenes                   sir  welcome 
it is my father will i should take on me
the hostess ship o  the day 
to camillo

seeming and savour all the winter long 
grace and remembrance be to you both 
and welcome to our shearing 


polixenes

shepherdess 
a fair one are you well you fit our ages
with flowers of winter 


perdita

sir  the year growing ancient 
not yet on summer death  nor on the birth
of trembling winter  the fairest
flowers o  the season
are our carnations and streak gillyvors 
which some call nature bastards  of that kind
our rustic garden barren  and i care not
to get slips of them 


polixenes

wherefore  gentle maiden 
do you neglect them 


perdita

for i have heard it said
there is an art which in their piedness shares
with great creating nature 


polixenes

say there be 
yet nature is made better by no mean
but nature makes that mean  so  over that art
which you say adds to nature  is an art
that nature makes  you see  sweet maid  we marry
a gentler scion to the wildest stock 
and make conceive a bark of baser kind
by bud of nobler race  this is an art
which does mend nature  change it rather  but
the art itself is nature 


perdita

so it is 


polixenes

then make your garden rich in gillyvors 
and do not call them bastards 


perdita

i not put
the dibble in earth to set one slip of them 
no more than were i painted i would wish
this youth should say  well and only therefore
desire to breed by me  here flowers for you 
hot lavender  mints  savoury  marjoram 
the marigold  that goes to bed wi  the sun
and with him rises weeping  these are flowers
of middle summer  and i think they are given
to men of middle age  you very welcome 


camillo

i should leave grazing  were i of your flock 
and only live by gazing 


perdita

out  alas 
you be so lean  that blasts of january
would blow you through and through 
now  my fair friend 
i would i had some flowers o  the spring that might
become your time of day  and yours  and yours 
that wear upon your virgin branches yet
your maidenheads growing  o proserpina 
for the flowers now  that frighted thou let fall
from dis waggon  daffodils 
that come before the swallow dares  and take
the winds of march with beauty  violets dim 
but sweeter than the lids of juno eyes
or cytherea breath  pale primroses
that die unmarried  ere they can behold
bight phoebus in his strength a malady
most incident to maids  bold oxlips and
the crown imperial  lilies of all kinds 
the flower de luce being one  o  these i lack 
to make you garlands of  and my sweet friend 
to strew him o and o er 


florizel

what  like a corse 


perdita

no  like a bank for love to lie and play on 
not like a corse  or if  not to be buried 
but quick and in mine arms  come  take your flowers 
methinks i play as i have seen them do
in whitsun pastorals  sure this robe of mine
does change my disposition 


florizel

what you do
still betters what is done  when you speak  sweet 
i have you do it ever  when you sing 
i have you buy and sell so  so give alms 
pray so  and  for the ordering your affairs 
to sing them too  when you do dance  i wish you
a wave o  the sea  that you might ever do
nothing but that  move still  still so 
and own no other function  each your doing 
so singular in each particular 
crowns what you are doing in the present deed 
that all your acts are queens 


perdita

o doricles 
your praises are too large  but that your youth 
and the true blood which peepeth fairly through t 
do plainly give you out an unstain shepherd 
with wisdom i might fear  my doricles 
you woo me the false way 


florizel

i think you have
as little skill to fear as i have purpose
to put you to t  but come  our dance  i pray 
your hand  my perdita  so turtles pair 
that never mean to part 


perdita

i swear for  em 


polixenes

this is the prettiest low born lass that ever
ran on the green sward  nothing she does or seems
but smacks of something greater than herself 
too noble for this place 


camillo

he tells her something
that makes her blood look out  good sooth  she is
the queen of curds and cream 


clown

come on  strike up

come  strike up 
music  here a dance of shepherds and shepherdesses


polixenes

pray  good shepherd  what fair swain is this
which dances with your daughter 


shepherd

they call him doricles  and boasts himself
to have a worthy feeding  but i have it
upon his own report and i believe it 
he looks like sooth  he says he loves my daughter 
i think so too  for never gazed the moon
upon the water as he stand and read
as  my daughter eyes  and  to be plain 
i think there is not half a kiss to choose
who loves another best 


polixenes

she dances featly 


shepherd

so she does any thing  though i report it 
that should be silent  if young doricles
do light upon her  she shall bring him that
which he not dreams of 
enter servant


servant

o master  if you did but hear the pedlar at the
door  you would never dance again after a tabour and
pipe  no  the bagpipe could not move you  he sings
several tunes faster than you tell money  he
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men 
ears grew to his tunes 


clown

he could never come better  he shall come in  i
love a ballad but even too well  if it be doleful
matter merrily set down  or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung lamentably 


servant

he hath songs for man or woman  of all sizes  no
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves  he
has the prettiest love songs for maids  so without
bawdry  which is strange  with such delicate
burthens of dildos and fadings   her and thump
her  and where some stretch mouthed rascal would 
as it were  mean mischief and break a foul gap into
the matter  he makes the maid to answer  whoop  do me
no harm  good man  puts him off  slights him  with
 whoop  do me no harm  good man 


polixenes

this is a brave fellow 


clown

believe me  thou talkest of an admirable conceited
fellow  has he any unbraided wares 


servant

he hath ribbons of an the colours i  the rainbow 
points more than all the lawyers in bohemia can
learnedly handle  though they come to him by the
gross  inkles  caddisses  cambrics  lawns  why  he
sings  over as they were gods or goddesses  you
would think a smock were a she angel  he so chants
to the sleeve hand and the work about the square on t 


clown

prithee bring him in  and let him approach singing 


perdita

forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in  tunes

buy lads  or else your lasses cry  come buy 


clown

if i were not in love with mopsa  thou shouldst take
no money of me  but being enthralled as i am  it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves 


mopsa

i was promised them against the feast  but they come
not too late now 


dorcas

he hath promised you more than that  or there be liars 


mopsa

he hath paid you all he promised you  may be  he has
paid you more  which will shame you to give him again 


clown

is there no manners left among maids  will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces  is there not milking time  when you are
going to bed  or kiln hole  to whistle off these
secrets  but you must be tittle tattling before all
our guests   well they are whispering  clamour
your tongues  and not a word more 


mopsa

i have done  come  you promised me a tawdry lace
and a pair of sweet gloves 


clown

have i not told thee how i was cozened by the way
and lost all my money 


autolycus

and indeed  sir  there are cozeners abroad 
therefore it behoves men to be wary 


clown

fear not thou  man  thou shalt lose nothing here

life  for then we are sure they are true 


autolycus

wife was brought to bed of twenty money bags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adders  heads and
toads carbonadoed 


mopsa

is it true  think you

the coast on wednesday the four score of april 
forty thousand fathom above water  and sung this
ballad against the hard hearts of maids  it was
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
loved her  the ballad is very pitiful and as true 


dorcas

is it true too  think you 


autolycus

five justices  hands at it  and witnesses more than
my pack will hold 


clown

this is a merry ballad  but a very pretty one 


mopsa

the tune of  maids wooing a man  there 
scarce a maid westward but she sings it   in
request  i can tell you 


mopsa

we can both sing it  if thou bear a part  thou
shalt hear   in three parts

master  there is three carters  three shepherds 
three neat herds  three swine herds  that have made
themselves all men of hair  they call themselves
saltiers  and they have a dance which the wenches
say is a gallimaufry of gambols  because they are
not in t  but they themselves are o  the mind  if it
be not too rough for some that know little but
bowling  it will please plentifully 


shepherd

away  we none on  t  here has been too much
homely foolery already  i know  sir  we weary you 


polixenes

you weary those that refresh us  pray  let see
these four threes of herdsmen 


servant

one three of them  by their own report  sir  hath
danced before the king  and not the worst of the
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier

pleased  let them come in  but quickly now

polixenes

o  father  you know more of that hereafter 
to camillo
is it not too far gone   time to part them 
he simple and tells much 
to florizel
how now  fair shepherd 
your heart is full of something that does take
your mind from feasting  sooth  when i was young
and handed love as you do  i was wont
to load my she with knacks  i would have ransack 
the pedlar silken treasury and have pour it
to her acceptance  you have let him go
and nothing marted with him  if your lass
interpretation should abuse and call this
your lack of love or bounty  you were straited
for a reply  at least if you make a care
of happy holding her 


florizel

old sir  i know
she prizes not such trifles as these are 
the gifts she looks from me are pack and lock 
up in my heart  which i have given already 
but not deliver d  o  hear me breathe my life
before this ancient sir  who  it should seem 
hath sometime loved  i take thy hand  this hand 
as soft as dove down and as white as it 
or ethiopian tooth  or the fann 
snow that bolted
by the northern blasts twice o er 


polixenes

what follows this 
how prettily the young swain seems to wash
the hand was fair before  i have put you out 
but to your protestation  let me hear
what you profess 


florizel

                  do  and be witness to  t 


polixenes

and this my neighbour too 


florizel

and he  and more
than he  and men  the earth  the heavens  and all 
that  were i crown the most imperial monarch 
thereof most worthy  were i the fairest youth
that ever made eye swerve  had force and knowledge
more than was ever man s  i would not prize them
without her love  for her employ them all 
commend them and condemn them to her service
or to their own perdition 


polixenes

fairly offer d 


camillo

this shows a sound affection 


shepherd

but  my daughter 
say you the like to him 


perdita

i cannot speak
so well  nothing so well  no  nor mean better 
by the pattern of mine own thoughts i cut out
the purity of his 


shepherd

                  take hands  a bargain 
and  friends unknown  you shall bear witness to  t 
i give my daughter to him  and will make
her portion equal his 


florizel

o  that must be
i  the virtue of your daughter  one being dead 
i shall have more than you can dream of yet 
enough then for your wonder  but  come on 
contract us  these witnesses 


shepherd

come  your hand 
and  daughter  yours 


polixenes

soft  swain  awhile  beseech you 
have you a father 


florizel

                  i have  but what of him 


polixenes

knows he of this 


florizel

                  he neither does nor shall 


polixenes

methinks a father
is at the nuptial of his son a guest
that best becomes the table  pray you once more 
is not your father grown incapable
of reasonable affairs  is he not stupid
with age and altering rheums  can he speak  hear 
know man from man  dispute his own estate 
lies he not bed rid  and again does nothing
but what he did being childish 


florizel

no  good sir 
he has his health and ampler strength indeed
than most have of his age 


polixenes

by my white beard 
you offer him  if this be so  a wrong
something unfilial  reason my son
should choose himself a wife  but as good reason
the father  all whose joy is nothing else
but fair posterity  should hold some counsel
in such a business 


florizel

i yield all this 
but for some other reasons  my grave sir 
which  not fit you know  i not acquaint
my father of this business 


polixenes

let him know t 


florizel

he shall not 


polixenes

                  prithee  let him 


florizel

no  he must not 


shepherd

let him  my son  he shall not need to grieve
at knowing of thy choice 


florizel

come  come  he must not 
mark our contract 


polixenes

                  mark your divorce  young sir 
discovering himself
whom son i dare not call  thou art too base
to be acknowledged  thou a sceptre heir 
that thus affect a sheep hook  thou old traitor 
i am sorry that by hanging thee i can
but shorten thy life one week  and thou  fresh piece
of excellent witchcraft  who of force must know
the royal fool thou copest with 


shepherd

o  my heart 


polixenes

i have thy beauty scratch with briers  and made
more homely than thy state  for thee  fond boy 
if i may ever know thou dost but sigh
that thou no more shalt see this knack  as never
i mean thou shalt  we bar thee from succession 
not hold thee of our blood  no  not our kin 
far than deucalion off  mark thou my words 
follow us to the court  thou churl  for this time 
though full of our displeasure  yet we free thee
from the dead blow of it  and you  enchantment 
worthy enough a herdsman  yea  him too 
that makes himself  but for our honour therein 
unworthy thee if ever henceforth thou
these rural latches to his entrance open 
or hoop his body more with thy embraces 
i will devise a death as cruel for thee
as thou art tender to t 
exit


perdita

even here undone 
i was not much afeard  for once or twice
i was about to speak and tell him plainly 
the selfsame sun that shines upon his court
hides not his visage from our cottage but
looks on alike  will please you  sir  be gone 
i told you what would come of this  beseech you 
of your own state take care  this dream of mine 
being now awake  i queen it no inch farther 
but milk my ewes and weep 


camillo

why  how now  father 
speak ere thou diest 


shepherd

i cannot speak  nor think
nor dare to know that which i know  o sir 
you have undone a man of fourscore three 
that thought to fill his grave in quiet  yea 
to die upon the bed my father died 
to lie close by his honest bones  but now
some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
where no priest shovels in dust  o cursed wretch 
that knew this was the prince 
and wouldst adventure
to mingle faith with him  undone  undone 
if i might die within this hour  i have lived
to die when i desire 
exit


florizel

why look you so upon me 
i am but sorry  not afeard  delay d 
but nothing alter d  what i was  i am 
more straining on for plucking back  not following
my leash unwillingly 


camillo

gracious my lord 
you know your father temper  at this time
he will allow no speech  which i do guess
you do not purpose to him  and as hardly
will he endure your sight as yet  i fear 
then  till the fury of his highness settle 
come not before him 


florizel

i not purpose it 
i think  camillo 


camillo

                  even he  my lord 


perdita

how often have i told you  be thus 
how often said  my dignity would last
but till  known 


florizel

it cannot fail but by
the violation of my faith  and then
let nature crush the sides o  the earth together
and mar the seeds within  lift up thy looks 
from my succession wipe me  father  i
am heir to my affection 


camillo

be advised 


florizel

i am  and by my fancy  if my reason
will thereto be obedient  i have reason 
if not  my senses  better pleased with madness 
do bid it welcome 


camillo

                  this is desperate  sir 


florizel

so call it  but it does fulfil my vow 
i needs must think it honesty  camillo 
not for bohemia  nor the pomp that may
be thereat glean d  for all the sun sees or
the close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
in unknown fathoms  will i break my oath
to this my fair beloved  therefore  i pray you 
as you have ever been my father honour friend 
when he shall miss me as  in faith  i mean not
to see him any more cast your good counsels
upon his passion  let myself and fortune
tug for the time to come  this you may know
and so deliver  i am put to sea
with her whom here i cannot hold on shore 
and most opportune to our need i have
a vessel rides fast by  but not prepared
for this design  what course i mean to hold
shall nothing benefit your knowledge  nor
concern me the reporting 


camillo

o my lord 
i would your spirit were easier for advice 
or stronger for your need 


florizel

hark  perdita
drawing her aside
i hear you by and by 


camillo

he irremoveable 
resolved for flight  now were i happy  if
his going i could frame to serve my turn 
save him from danger  do him love and honour 
purchase the sight again of dear sicilia
and that unhappy king  my master  whom
i so much thirst to see 


florizel

now  good camillo 
i am so fraught with curious business that
i leave out ceremony 


camillo

sir  i think
you have heard of my poor services  i  the love
that i have borne your father 


florizel

very nobly
have you deserved  it is my father music
to speak your deeds  not little of his care
to have them recompensed as thought on 


camillo

well  my lord 
if you may please to think i love the king
and through him what is nearest to him  which is
your gracious self  embrace but my direction 
if your more ponderous and settled project
may suffer alteration  on mine honour 
i point you where you shall have such receiving
as shall become your highness  where you may
enjoy your mistress  from the whom  i see 
there no disjunction to be made  but by 
as heavens forefend your ruin  marry her 
and  with my best endeavours in your absence 
your discontenting father strive to qualify
and bring him up to liking 


florizel

how  camillo 
may this  almost a miracle  be done 
that i may call thee something more than man
and after that trust to thee 


camillo

have you thought on
a place whereto you go 


florizel

not any yet 
but as the unthought on accident is guilty
to what we wildly do  so we profess
ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
of every wind that blows 


camillo

then list to me 
this follows  if you will not change your purpose
but undergo this flight  make for sicilia 
and there present yourself and your fair princess 
for so i see she must be   leontes 
she shall be habited as it becomes
the partner of your bed  methinks i see
leontes opening his free arms and weeping
his welcomes forth  asks thee the son forgiveness 
as  i  the father person  kisses the hands
of your fresh princess  o and o divides him
 his unkindness and his kindness  the one
he chides to hell and bids the other grow
faster than thought or time 


florizel

worthy camillo 
what colour for my visitation shall i
hold up before him 


camillo

sent by the king your father
to greet him and to give him comforts  sir 
the manner of your bearing towards him  with
what you as from your father shall deliver 
things known betwixt us three  i write you down 
the which shall point you forth at every sitting
what you must say  that he shall not perceive
but that you have your father bosom there
and speak his very heart 


florizel

i am bound to you 
there is some sap in this 


camillo

a cause more promising
than a wild dedication of yourselves
to unpath waters  undream shores  most certain
to miseries enough  no hope to help you 
but as you shake off one to take another 
nothing so certain as your anchors  who
do their best office  if they can but stay you
where you be loath to be  besides you know
prosperity the very bond of love 
whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
affliction alters 


perdita

                  one of these is true 
i think affliction may subdue the cheek 
but not take in the mind 


camillo

yea  say you so 
there shall not at your father house these
seven years
be born another such 


florizel

my good camillo 
she is as forward of her breeding as
she is i  the rear our birth 


camillo

i cannot say  pity
she lacks instructions  for she seems a mistress
to most that teach 


perdita

your pardon  sir  for this
i blush you thanks 


florizel

my prettiest perdita 
but o  the thorns we stand upon  camillo 
preserver of my father  now of me 
the medicine of our house  how shall we do 
we are not furnish like bohemia son 
nor shall appear in sicilia 


camillo

my lord 
fear none of this  i think you know my fortunes
do all lie there  it shall be so my care
to have you royally appointed as if
the scene you play were mine  for instance  sir 
that you may know you shall not want  one word 
they talk aside
re enter autolycus


autolycus

ha  ha  what a fool honesty is  and trust  his
sworn brother  a very simple gentleman  i have sold
all my trumpery  not a counterfeit stone  not a
ribbon  glass  pomander  brooch  table book  ballad 
knife  tape  glove  shoe tie  bracelet  horn ring 
to keep my pack from fasting  they throng who
should buy first  as if my trinkets had been
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer 
by which means i saw whose purse was best in
picture  and what i saw  to my good use i
remembered  my clown  who wants but something to
be a reasonable man  grew so in love with the
wenches  song  that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words  which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
stuck in ears  you might have pinched a placket  it
was senseless   nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse  i could have filed keys off that hung in
chains  no hearing  no feeling  but my sir song 
and admiring the nothing of it  so that in this
time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their
festival purses  and had not the old man come in
with a whoo bub against his daughter and the king 
son and scared my choughs from the chaff  i had not
left a purse alive in the whole army 
camillo  florizel  and perdita come forward


camillo

nay  but my letters  by this means being there
so soon as you arrive  shall clear that doubt 


florizel

and those that you procure from king leontes 


camillo

shall satisfy your father 


perdita

happy be you 
all that you speak shows fair 


camillo

who have we here 
seeing autolycus
we make an instrument of this  omit
nothing may give us aid 


autolycus

if they have overheard me now  why  hanging 


camillo

how now  good fellow  why shakest thou so  fear
not  man  here no harm intended to thee 


autolycus

i am a poor fellow  sir 


camillo

why  be so still  here nobody will steal that from
thee  yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
make an exchange  therefore discase thee instantly 
 thou must think there a necessity in t and
change garments with this gentleman  though the
pennyworth on his side be the worst  yet hold thee 
there some boot 


autolycus

i am a poor fellow  sir 
aside
i know ye well enough 


camillo

nay  prithee  dispatch  the gentleman is half
flayed already 


autolycus

are you in earnest  sir 
aside
i smell the trick on t 


florizel

dispatch  i prithee 


autolycus

indeed  i have had earnest  but i cannot with
conscience take it 


camillo

unbuckle  unbuckle 
florizel and autolycus exchange garments
fortunate mistress let my prophecy
come home to ye you must retire yourself
into some covert  take your sweetheart hat
and pluck it o your brows  muffle your face 
dismantle you  and  as you can  disliken
the truth of your own seeming  that you may 
for i do fear eyes over to shipboard
get undescried 


perdita

                  i see the play so lies
that i must bear a part 


camillo

no remedy 
have you done there 


florizel

should i now meet my father 
he would not call me son 


camillo

nay  you shall have no hat 
giving it to perdita
come  lady  come  farewell  my friend 


autolycus

adieu  sir 


florizel

o perdita  what have we twain forgot 
pray you  a word 


camillo

 aside   what i do next  shall be to tell the king
of this escape and whither they are bound 
wherein my hope is i shall so prevail
to force him after  in whose company
i shall review sicilia  for whose sight
i have a woman longing 


florizel

fortune speed us 
thus we set on  camillo  to the sea side 


camillo

the swifter speed the better 
exeunt florizel  perdita  and camillo


autolycus

i understand the business  i hear it  to have an
open ear  a quick eye  and a nimble hand  is
necessary for a cut purse  a good nose is requisite
also  to smell out work for the other senses  i see
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive 
what an exchange had this been without boot  what
a boot is here with this exchange  sure the gods do
this year connive at us  and we may do any thing
extempore  the prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity  stealing away from his father with his
clog at his heels  if i thought it were a piece of
honesty to acquaint the king withal  i would not
do t  i hold it the more knavery to conceal it 
and therein am i constant to my profession 
re enter clown and shepherd
aside  aside  here is more matter for a hot brain 
every lane end  every shop  church  session 
hanging  yields a careful man work 


clown

see  see  what a man you are now 
there is no other way but to tell the king
she a changeling and none of your flesh and blood 


shepherd

nay  but hear me 


clown

nay  but hear me 


shepherd

go to  then 


clown

she being none of your flesh and blood  your flesh
and blood has not offended the king  and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him  show
those things you found about her  those secret
things  all but what she has with her  this being
done  let the law go whistle  i warrant you 


shepherd

i will tell the king all  every word  yea  and his
son pranks too  who  i may say  is no honest man 
neither to his father nor to me  to go about to make
me the king brother in law 


clown

indeed  brother in law was the farthest off you
could have been to him and then your blood had been
the dearer by i know how much an ounce 


autolycus

 aside   very wisely  puppies 


shepherd

well  let us to the king  there is that in this
fardel will make him scratch his beard 


autolycus

 aside   i know not what impediment this complaint
may be to the flight of my master 


clown

pray heartily he be at palace 


autolycus

 aside   though i am not naturally honest  i am so
sometimes by chance  let me pocket up my pedlar excrement 
takes off his false beard
how now  rustics  whither are you bound 


shepherd

to the palace  an it like your worship 


autolycus

your affairs there  what  with whom  the condition
of that fardel  the place of your dwelling  your
names  your ages  of what having  breeding  and any
thing that is fitting to be known  discover 


clown

we are but plain fellows  sir 


autolycus

a lie  you are rough and hairy  let me have no
lying  it becomes none but tradesmen  and they
often give us soldiers the lie  but we pay them for
it with stamped coin  not stabbing steel  therefore
they do not give us the lie 


clown

your worship had like to have given us one  if you
had not taken yourself with the manner 


shepherd

are you a courtier  an like you  sir 


autolycus

whether it like me or no  i am a courtier  seest
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings 
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court 
receives not thy nose court odor from me  reflect i
not on thy baseness court contempt  thinkest thou 
for that i insinuate  or toaze from thee thy
business  i am therefore no courtier  i am courtier
cap a pe  and one that will either push on or pluck
back thy business there  whereupon i command thee to
open thy affair 


shepherd

my business  sir  is to the king 


autolycus

what advocate hast thou to him 


shepherd

i know not  an like you 


clown

advocate the court word for a pheasant  say you
have none 


shepherd

none  sir  i have no pheasant  cock nor hen 


autolycus

how blessed are we that are not simple men 
yet nature might have made me as these are 
therefore i will not disdain 


clown

this cannot be but a great courtier 


shepherd

his garments are rich  but he wears
them not handsomely 


clown

he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical 
a great man  i warrant  i know by the picking
on teeth 


autolycus

the fardel there  what i  the fardel 
wherefore that box 


shepherd

sir  there lies such secrets in this fardel and box 
which none must know but the king  and which he
shall know within this hour  if i may come to the
speech of him 


autolycus

age  thou hast lost thy labour 


shepherd

why  sir 


autolycus

the king is not at the palace  he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself  for 
if thou beest capable of things serious  thou must
know the king is full of grief 


shepard

so  said  sir  about his son  that should have
married a shepherd daughter 


autolycus

if that shepherd be not in hand fast  let him fly 
the curses he shall have  the tortures he shall
feel  will break the back of man  the heart of monster 


clown

think you so  sir 


autolycus

not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance bitter  but those that are germane to
him  though removed fifty times  shall all come
under the hangman  which though it be great pity 
yet it is necessary  an old sheep whistling rogue a
ram tender  to offer to have his daughter come into
grace  some say he shall be stoned  but that death
is too soft for him  say i	draw our throne into a
sheep cote  all deaths are too few  the sharpest too easy 


clown

has the old man e a son  sir  do you hear  an 
like you  sir 


autolycus

he has a son  who shall be flayed alive  then
 over with honey  set on the head of a
wasp nest  then stand till he be three quarters
and a dram dead  then recovered again with
aqua vitae or some other hot infusion  then  raw as
he is  and in the hottest day prognostication
proclaims  shall be be set against a brick wall  the
sun looking with a southward eye upon him  where he
is to behold him with flies blown to death  but what
talk we of these traitorly rascals  whose miseries
are to be smiled at  their offences being so
capital  tell me  for you seem to be honest plain
men  what you have to the king  being something
gently considered  i bring you where he is
aboard  tender your persons to his presence 
whisper him in your behalfs  and if it be in man
besides the king to effect your suits  here is man
shall do it 


clown

he seems to be of great authority  close with him 
give him gold  and though authority be a stubborn
bear  yet he is oft led by the nose with gold  show
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand 
and no more ado  remember  stoned  and  alive 


shepherd

an please you  sir  to undertake the business for
us  here is that gold i have  i make it as much
more and leave this young man in pawn till i bring it you 


autolycus

after i have done what i promised 


shepherd

ay  sir 


autolycus

well  give me the moiety  are you a party in this business 


clown

in some sort  sir  but though my case be a pitiful
one  i hope i shall not be flayed out of it 


autolycus

o  that the case of the shepherd son  hang him 
he be made an example 


clown

comfort  good comfort  we must to the king and show
our strange sights  he must know  none of your
daughter nor my sister  we are gone else  sir  i
will give you as much as this old man does when the
business is performed  and remain  as he says  your
pawn till it be brought you 


autolycus

i will trust you  walk before toward the sea side 
go on the right hand  i will but look upon the
hedge and follow you 


clown

we are blest in this man  as i may say  even blest 


shepherd

let before as he bids us  he was provided to do us good 
exeunt shepherd and clown


autolycus

if i had a mind to be honest  i see fortune would
not suffer me  she drops booties in my mouth  i am
courted now with a double occasion  gold and a means
to do the prince my master good  which who knows how
that may turn back to my advancement  i will bring
these two moles  these blind ones  aboard him  if he
think it fit to shore them again and that the
complaint they have to the king concerns him
nothing  let him call me rogue for being so far
officious  for i am proof against that title and
what shame else belongs to t  to him will i present
them  there may be matter in it
