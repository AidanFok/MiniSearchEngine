enter leontes  cleomenes  dion  paulina  and servants


cleomenes

sir  you have done enough  and have perform 
a saint like sorrow  no fault could you make 
which you have not redeem d  indeed  paid down
more penitence than done trespass  at the last 
do as the heavens have done  forget your evil 
with them forgive yourself 


leontes

whilst i remember
her and her virtues  i cannot forget
my blemishes in them  and so still think of
the wrong i did myself  which was so much 
that heirless it hath made my kingdom and
destroy the sweet companion that e man
bred his hopes out of 


paulina

true  too true  my lord 
if  one by one  you wedded all the world 
or from the all that are took something good 
to make a perfect woman  she you kill 
would be unparallel d 


leontes

i think so  kill d 
she i kill d  i did so  but thou strikest me
sorely  to say i did  it is as bitter
upon thy tongue as in my thought  now  good now 
say so but seldom 


cleomenes

                  not at all  good lady 
you might have spoken a thousand things that would
have done the time more benefit and graced
your kindness better 


paulina

you are one of those
would have him wed again 


dion

if you would not so 
you pity not the state  nor the remembrance
of his most sovereign name  consider little
what dangers  by his highness  fail of issue 
may drop upon his kingdom and devour
incertain lookers on  what were more holy
than to rejoice the former queen is well 
what holier than  for royalty repair 
for present comfort and for future good 
to bless the bed of majesty again
with a sweet fellow to t 


paulina

there is none worthy 
respecting her that gone  besides  the gods
will have fulfill their secret purposes 
for has not the divine apollo said 
is not the tenor of his oracle 
that king leontes shall not have an heir
till his lost child be found  which that it shall 
is all as monstrous to our human reason
as my antigonus to break his grave
and come again to me  who  on my life 
did perish with the infant   your counsel
my lord should to the heavens be contrary 
oppose against their wills 
to leontes
care not for issue 
the crown will find an heir  great alexander
left his to the worthiest  so his successor
was like to be the best 


leontes

good paulina 
who hast the memory of hermione 
i know  in honour  o  that ever i
had squared me to thy counsel  then  even now 
i might have look upon my queen full eyes 
have taken treasure from her lips 


paulina

and left them
more rich for what they yielded 


leontes

thou speak truth 
no more such wives  therefore  no wife  one worse 
and better used  would make her sainted spirit
again possess her corpse  and on this stage 
where we offenders now  appear soul vex d 
and begin   to me 


paulina

had she such power 
she had just cause 


leontes

she had  and would incense me
to murder her i married 


paulina

i should so 
were i the ghost that walk d  i bid you mark
her eye  and tell me for what dull part in 
you chose her  then i shriek  that even your ears
should rift to hear me  and the words that follow 
should be  mine 


leontes

stars  stars 
and all eyes else dead coals  fear thou no wife 
i have no wife  paulina 


paulina

will you swear
never to marry but by my free leave 


leontes

never  paulina  so be blest my spirit 


paulina

then  good my lords  bear witness to his oath 


cleomenes

you tempt him over much 


paulina

unless another 
as like hermione as is her picture 
affront his eye 


cleomenes

                  good madam 


paulina

i have done 
yet  if my lord will marry if you will  sir 
no remedy  but you will give me the office
to choose you a queen  she shall not be so young
as was your former  but she shall be such
as  walk your first queen ghost 
it should take joy
to see her in your arms 


leontes

my true paulina 
we shall not marry till thou bid us 


paulina

that
shall be when your first queen again in breath 
never till then 
enter a gentleman


gentleman

one that gives out himself prince florizel 
son of polixenes  with his princess  she
the fairest i have yet beheld  desires access
to your high presence 


leontes

what with him  he comes not
like to his father greatness  his approach 
so out of circumstance and sudden  tells us
 not a visitation framed  but forced
by need and accident  what train 


gentleman

but few 
and those but mean 


leontes

his princess  say you  with him 


gentleman

ay  the most peerless piece of earth  i think 
that e the sun shone bright on 


paulina

o hermione 
as every present time doth boast itself
above a better gone  so must thy grave
give way to what seen now  sir  you yourself
have said and writ so  but your writing now
is colder than that theme   had not been 
nor was not to be equall d thus your verse
flow with her beauty once   shrewdly ebb d 
to say you have seen a better 


gentleman

pardon  madam 
the one i have almost forgot your pardon 
the other  when she has obtain your eye 
will have your tongue too  this is a creature 
would she begin a sect  might quench the zeal
of all professors else  make proselytes
of who she but bid follow 


paulina

how  not women 


gentleman

women will love her  that she is a woman
more worth than any man  men  that she is
the rarest of all women 


leontes

go  cleomenes 
yourself  assisted with your honour friends 
bring them to our embracement  still   strange
exeunt cleomenes and others
he thus should steal upon us 


paulina

had our prince 
jewel of children  seen this hour  he had pair 
well with this lord  there was not full a month
between their births 


leontes

prithee  no more  cease  thou know 
he dies to me again when talk of  sure 
when i shall see this gentleman  thy speeches
will bring me to consider that which may
unfurnish me of reason  they are come 
re enter cleomenes and others  with florizel and perdita
your mother was most true to wedlock  prince 
for she did print your royal father off 
conceiving you  were i but twenty one 
your father image is so hit in you 
his very air  that i should call you brother 
as i did him  and speak of something wildly
by us perform before  most dearly welcome 
and your fair princess goddess o  alas 
i lost a couple  that  heaven and earth
might thus have stood begetting wonder as
you  gracious couple  do  and then i lost 
all mine own folly the society 
amity too  of your brave father  whom 
though bearing misery  i desire my life
once more to look on him 


florizel

by his command
have i here touch sicilia and from him
give you all greetings that a king  at friend 
can send his brother  and  but infirmity
which waits upon worn times hath something seized
his wish ability  he had himself
the lands and waters  your throne and his
measured to look upon you  whom he loves 
he bade me say so more than all the sceptres
and those that bear them living 


leontes

o my brother 
good gentleman  the wrongs i have done thee stir
afresh within me  and these thy offices 
so rarely kind  are as interpreters
of my behind hand slackness  welcome hither 
as is the spring to the earth  and hath he too
exposed this paragon to the fearful usage 
at least ungentle  of the dreadful neptune 
to greet a man not worth her pains  much less
the adventure of her person 


florizel

good my lord 
she came from libya 


leontes

where the warlike smalus

who for bohemia bend  to signify
not only my success in libya  sir 
but my arrival and my wife in safety
here where we are

purge all infection from our air whilst you
do climate here  you have a holy father 
a graceful gentleman  against whose person 
so sacred as it is  i have done sin 
for which the heavens  taking angry note 
have left me issueless  and your father blest 
as he from heaven merits it  with you
worthy his goodness  what might i have been 
might i a son and daughter now have look on 
such goodly things as you 
enter a lord


lord

most noble sir

were not the proof so nigh  please you  great sir

when once she is my wife 


leontes

that  once  i see by your good father speed

most sorry  you have broken from his liking
where you were tied in duty  and as sorry
your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty 
that you might well enjoy her 


florizel

though fortune  visible an enemy 
should chase us with my father  power no jot

paulina

sir  my liege 
your eye hath too much youth in t  not a month

to florizel
but your petition
is yet unanswer d  i will to your father 
your honour not o by your desires

i now go toward him  therefore follow me
and mark what way i make  come  good my lord
