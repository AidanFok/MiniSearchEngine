scene ii  before leontes  palace 


enter autolycus and a gentleman


autolycus

beseech you  sir  were you present at this relation 


first gentleman

i was by at the opening of the fardel  heard the old
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it 
whereupon  after a little amazedness  we were all
commanded out of the chamber  only this methought i
heard the shepherd say  he found the child 


autolycus

i would most gladly know the issue of it 


first gentleman

i make a broken delivery of the business  but the
changes i perceived in the king and camillo were
very notes of admiration  they seemed almost  with
staring on one another  to tear the cases of their
eyes  there was speech in their dumbness  language
in their very gesture  they looked as they had heard
of a world ransomed  or one destroyed  a notable
passion of wonder appeared in them  but the wisest
beholder  that knew no more but seeing  could not
say if the importance were joy or sorrow  but in the
extremity of the one  it must needs be 
enter another gentleman
here comes a gentleman that haply knows more 
the news  rogero 


second gentleman

nothing but bonfires  the oracle is fulfilled  the
king daughter is found  such a deal of wonder is
broken out within this hour that ballad makers
cannot be able to express it 
enter a third gentleman
here comes the lady paulina steward  he can
deliver you more  how goes it now  sir  this news
which is called true is so like an old tale  that
the verity of it is in strong suspicion  has the king
found his heir 


third gentleman

most true  if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance  that which you hear you swear you
see  there is such unity in the proofs  the mantle
of queen hermione s  her jewel about the neck of it 
the letters of antigonus found with it which they
know to be his character  the majesty of the
creature in resemblance of the mother  the affection
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding 
and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the king daughter  did you see
the meeting of the two kings 


second gentleman

no 


third gentleman

then have you lost a sight  which was to be seen 
cannot be spoken of  there might you have beheld one
joy crown another  so and in such manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them  for their
joy waded in tears  there was casting up of eyes 
holding up of hands  with countenances of such
distraction that they were to be known by garment 
not by favour  our king  being ready to leap out of
himself for joy of his found daughter  as if that
joy were now become a loss  cries  o  thy mother 
thy mother  then asks bohemia forgiveness  then
embraces his son in law  then again worries he his
daughter with clipping her  now he thanks the old
shepherd  which stands by like a weather bitten
conduit of many kings  reigns  i never heard of such
another encounter  which lames report to follow it
and undoes description to do it 


second gentleman

what  pray you  became of antigonus  that carried
hence the child 


third gentleman

like an old tale still  which will have matter to
rehearse  though credit be asleep and not an ear
open  he was torn to pieces with a bear  this
avouches the shepherd son  who has not only his
innocence  which seems much  to justify him  but a
handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows 


first gentleman

what became of his bark and his followers 


third gentleman

wrecked the same instant of their master death and
in the view of the shepherd  so that all the
instruments which aided to expose the child were
even then lost when it was found  but o  the noble
combat that  joy and sorrow was fought in
paulina  she had one eye declined for the loss of
her husband  another elevated that the oracle was
fulfilled  she lifted the princess from the earth 
and so locks her in embracing  as if she would pin
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
of losing 


first gentleman

the dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes  for by such was it acted 


third gentleman

one of the prettiest touches of all and that which
angled for mine eyes  caught the water though not
the fish  was when  at the relation of the queen 
death  with the manner how she came to bravely
confessed and lamented by the king  how
attentiveness wounded his daughter  till  from one
sign of dolour to another  she did  with an  alas 
i would fain say  bleed tears  for i am sure my
heart wept blood  who was most marble there changed
colour  some swooned  all sorrowed  if all the world
could have seen  t  the woe had been universal 


first gentleman

are they returned to the court 


third gentleman

no  the princess hearing of her mother statue 
which is in the keeping of paulina a piece many
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
italian master  julio romano  who  had he himself
eternity and could put breath into his work  would
beguile nature of her custom  so perfectly he is her
ape  he so near to hermione hath done hermione that
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
answer  thither with all greediness of affection
are they gone  and there they intend to sup 


second gentleman

i thought she had some great matter there in hand 
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day  ever
since the death of hermione  visited that removed
house  shall we thither and with our company piece
the rejoicing 


first gentleman

who would be thence that has the benefit of access 
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born 
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge 
let along 
exeunt gentlemen


autolycus

now  had i not the dash of my former life in me 
would preferment drop on my head  i brought the old
man and his son aboard the prince  told him i heard
them talk of a fardel and i know not what  but he
at that time  overfond of the shepherd daughter 
so he then took her to be  who began to be much
sea sick  and himself little better  extremity of
weather continuing  this mystery remained
undiscovered  but  all one to me  for had i
been the finder out of this secret  it would not
have relished among my other discredits 
enter shepherd and clown
here come those i have done good to against my will 
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune 


shepherd

come  boy  i am past moe children  but thy sons and
daughters will be all gentlemen born 


clown

you are well met  sir  you denied to fight with me
this other day  because i was no gentleman born 
see you these clothes  say you see them not and
think me still no gentleman born  you were best say
these robes are not gentlemen born  give me the
lie  do  and try whether i am not now a gentleman born 


autolycus

i know you are now  sir  a gentleman born 


clown

ay  and have been so any time these four hours 


shepherd

and so have i  boy 


clown

so you have  but i was a gentleman born before my
father  for the king son took me by the hand  and
called me brother  and then the two kings called my
father brother  and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father  and
so we wept  and there was the first gentleman like
tears that ever we shed 


shepherd

we may live  son  to shed many more 


clown

ay  or else  hard luck  being in so
preposterous estate as we are 


autolycus

i humbly beseech you  sir  to pardon me all the
faults i have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master 


shepherd

prithee  son  do  for we must be gentle  now we are
gentlemen 


clown

thou wilt amend thy life 


autolycus

ay  an it like your good worship 


clown

give me thy hand  i will swear to the prince thou
art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia 


shepherd

you may say it  but not swear it 


clown

not swear it  now i am a gentleman  let boors and
franklins say it  i swear it 


shepherd

how if it be false  son 


clown

if it be ne so false  a true gentleman may swear
it in the behalf of his friend  and i swear to
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk  but i know thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk  but i swear it  and i would thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of thy hands 


autolycus

i will prove so  sir  to my power 


clown

ay  by any means prove a tall fellow  if i do not
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk  not
being a tall fellow  trust me not  hark  the kings
and the princes  our kindred  are going to see the
queen picture  come  follow us  we be thy
good masters
