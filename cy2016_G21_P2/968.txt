leontes

o grave and good paulina  the great comfort
that i have had of thee 


paulina

what  sovereign sir 
i did not well i meant well  all my services
you have paid home  but that you have vouchsafed 
with your crown brother and these your contracted
heirs of your kingdoms  my poor house to visit 
it is a surplus of your grace  which never
my life may last to answer 


leontes

o paulina 
we honour you with trouble  but we came
to see the statue of our queen  your gallery
have we pass through  not without much content
in many singularities  but we saw not
that which my daughter came to look upon 
the statue of her mother 


paulina

as she lived peerless 
so her dead likeness  i do well believe 
excels whatever yet you look upon
or hand of man hath done  therefore i keep it
lonely  apart  but here it is  prepare
to see the life as lively mock as ever
still sleep mock death  behold  and say  well 
paulina draws a curtain  and discovers hermione standing like a statue
i like your silence  it the more shows off
your wonder  but yet speak  first  you  my liege 
comes it not something near 


leontes

her natural posture 
chide me  dear stone  that i may say indeed
thou art hermione  or rather  thou art she
in thy not chiding  for she was as tender
as infancy and grace  but yet  paulina 
hermione was not so much wrinkled  nothing
so aged as this seems 


polixenes

o  not by much 


paulina

so much the more our carver excellence 
which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
as she lived now 


leontes

                  as now she might have done 
so much to my good comfort  as it is
now piercing to my soul  o  thus she stood 
even with such life of majesty  warm life 
as now it coldly stands  when first i woo her 
i am ashamed  does not the stone rebuke me
for being more stone than it  o royal piece 
there magic in thy majesty  which has
my evils conjured to remembrance and
from thy admiring daughter took the spirits 
standing like stone with thee 


perdita

and give me leave 
and do not say  superstition  that
i kneel and then implore her blessing  lady 
dear queen  that ended when i but began 
give me that hand of yours to kiss 


paulina

o  patience 
the statue is but newly fix d  the colour not dry 


camillo

my lord  your sorrow was too sore laid on 
which sixteen winters cannot blow away 
so many summers dry  scarce any joy
did ever so long live  no sorrow
but kill itself much sooner 


polixenes

dear my brother 
let him that was the cause of this have power
to take off so much grief from you as he
will piece up in himself 


paulina

indeed  my lord 
if i had thought the sight of my poor image
would thus have wrought you for the stone is mine 
i not have show it 


leontes

do not draw the curtain 


paulina

no longer shall you gaze on t  lest your fancy
may think anon it moves 


leontes

let be  let be 
would i were dead  but that  methinks  already 
what was he that did make it  see  my lord 
would you not deem it breathed  and that those veins
did verily bear blood 


polixenes

masterly done 
the very life seems warm upon her lip 


leontes

the fixture of her eye has motion in t 
as we are mock with art 


paulina

i draw the curtain 
my lord almost so far transported that
he think anon it lives 


leontes

o sweet paulina 
make me to think so twenty years together 
no settled senses of the world can match
the pleasure of that madness  let  alone 


paulina

i am sorry  sir  i have thus far stirr you  but
i could afflict you farther 


leontes

do  paulina 
for this affliction has a taste as sweet
as any cordial comfort  still  methinks 
there is an air comes from her  what fine chisel
could ever yet cut breath  let no man mock me 
for i will kiss her 


paulina

good my lord  forbear 
the ruddiness upon her lip is wet 
you mar it if you kiss it  stain your own
with oily painting  shall i draw the curtain 


leontes

no  not these twenty years 


perdita

so long could i
stand by  a looker on 


paulina

either forbear 
quit presently the chapel  or resolve you
for more amazement  if you can behold it 
i make the statue move indeed  descend
and take you by the hand  but then you think 
which i protest against i am assisted
by wicked powers 


leontes

                  what you can make her do 
i am content to look on  what to speak 
i am content to hear  for  as easy
to make her speak as move 


paulina

it is required
you do awake your faith  then all stand still 
on  those that think it is unlawful business
i am about  let them depart 


leontes

proceed 
no foot shall stir 


paulina

music  awake her  strike 
music
 time  descend  be stone no more  approach 
strike all that look upon with marvel  come 
i fill your grave up  stir  nay  come away 
bequeath to death your numbness  for from him
dear life redeems you  you perceive she stirs 
hermione comes down
start not  her actions shall be holy as
you hear my spell is lawful  do not shun her
until you see her die again  for then
you kill her double  nay  present your hand 
when she was young you woo her  now in age
is she become the suitor 


leontes

o  she warm 
if this be magic  let it be an art
lawful as eating 


polixenes

                  she embraces him 


camillo

she hangs about his neck 
if she pertain to life let her speak too 


polixenes

ay  and make manifest where she has lived 
or how stolen from the dead 


paulina

that she is living 
were it but told you  should be hooted at
like an old tale  but it appears she lives 
though yet she speak not  mark a little while 
please you to interpose  fair madam  kneel
and pray your mother blessing  turn  good lady 
our perdita is found 


hermione

you gods  look down
and from your sacred vials pour your graces
upon my daughter head  tell me  mine own 
where hast thou been preserved  where lived  how found
thy father court  for thou shalt hear that i 
knowing by paulina that the oracle
gave hope thou wast in being  have preserved
myself to see the issue 


paulina

there time enough for that 
lest they desire upon this push to trouble
your joys with like relation  go together 
you precious winners all  your exultation
partake to every one  i  an old turtle 
will wing me to some wither bough and there
my mate  that never to be found again 
lament till i am lost 


leontes

o  peace  paulina 
thou shouldst a husband take by my consent 
as i by thine a wife  this is a match 
and made between by vows  thou hast found mine 
but how  is to be question d  for i saw her 
as i thought  dead  and have in vain said many
a prayer upon her grave  i not seek far 
for him  i partly know his mind to find thee
an honourable husband  come  camillo 
and take her by the hand  whose worth and honesty
is richly noted and here justified
by us  a pair of kings  let from this place 
what  look upon my brother  both your pardons 
that e i put between your holy looks
my ill suspicion  this is your son in law 
and son unto the king  who  heavens directing 
is troth plight to your daughter  good paulina 
lead us from hence  where we may leisurely
each one demand an answer to his part
perform in this wide gap of time since first
we were dissever d  hastily lead away 
exeunt
