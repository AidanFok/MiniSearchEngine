king henry vi

this battle fares like to the morning war 
when dying clouds contend with growing light 
what time the shepherd  blowing of his nails 
can neither call it perfect day nor night 
now sways it this way  like a mighty sea
forced by the tide to combat with the wind 
now sways it that way  like the selfsame sea
forced to retire by fury of the wind 
sometime the flood prevails  and then the wind 
now one the better  then another best 
both tugging to be victors  breast to breast 
yet neither conqueror nor conquered 
so is the equal of this fell war 
here on this molehill will i sit me down 
to whom god will  there be the victory 
for margaret my queen  and clifford too 
have chid me from the battle  swearing both
they prosper best of all when i am thence 
would i were dead  if god good will were so 
for what is in this world but grief and woe 
o god  methinks it were a happy life 
to be no better than a homely swain 
to sit upon a hill  as i do now 
to carve out dials quaintly  point by point 
thereby to see the minutes how they run 
how many make the hour full complete 
how many hours bring about the day 
how many days will finish up the year 
how many years a mortal man may live 
when this is known  then to divide the times 
so many hours must i tend my flock 
so many hours must i take my rest 
so many hours must i contemplate 
so many hours must i sport myself 
so many days my ewes have been with young 
so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean 
so many years ere i shall shear the fleece 
so minutes  hours  days  months  and years 
pass over to the end they were created 
would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave 
ah  what a life were this  how sweet  how lovely 
gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
to shepherds looking on their silly sheep 
than doth a rich embroider canopy
to kings that fear their subjects  treachery 
o  yes  it doth  a thousand fold it doth 
and to conclude  the shepherd homely curds 
his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle 
his wonted sleep under a fresh tree shade 
all which secure and sweetly he enjoys 
is far beyond a prince delicates 
his viands sparkling in a golden cup 
his body couched in a curious bed 
when care  mistrust  and treason waits on him 
alarum  enter a son that has killed his father  dragging in the dead body


son

ill blows the wind that profits nobody 
this man  whom hand to hand i slew in fight 
may be possessed with some store of crowns 
and i  that haply take them from him now 
may yet ere night yield both my life and them
to some man else  as this dead man doth me 
who this  o god  it is my father face 
whom in this conflict i unwares have kill d 
o heavy times  begetting such events 
from london by the king was i press forth 
my father  being the earl of warwick man 
came on the part of york  press by his master 
and i  who at his hands received my life  him
have by my hands of life bereaved him 
pardon me  god  i knew not what i did 
and pardon  father  for i knew not thee 
my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks 
and no more words till they have flow their fill 


king henry vi

o piteous spectacle  o bloody times 
whiles lions war and battle for their dens 
poor harmless lambs abide their enmity 
weep  wretched man  i aid thee tear for tear 
and let our hearts and eyes  like civil war 
be blind with tears  and break o with grief 
enter a father that has killed his son  bringing in the body


father

thou that so stoutly hast resisted me 
give me thy gold  if thou hast any gold 
for i have bought it with an hundred blows 
but let me see  is this our foeman face 
ah  no  no  no  it is mine only son 
ah  boy  if any life be left in thee 
throw up thine eye  see  see what showers arise 
blown with the windy tempest of my heart 
upon thy words  that kill mine eye and heart 
o  pity  god  this miserable age 
what stratagems  how fell  how butcherly 
erroneous  mutinous and unnatural 
this deadly quarrel daily doth beget 
o boy  thy father gave thee life too soon 
and hath bereft thee of thy life too late 


king henry vi

woe above woe  grief more than common grief 
o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds 
o pity  pity  gentle heaven  pity 
the red rose and the white are on his face 
the fatal colours of our striving houses 
the one his purple blood right well resembles 
the other his pale cheeks  methinks  presenteth 
wither one rose  and let the other flourish 
if you contend  a thousand lives must wither 


son

how will my mother for a father death
take on with me and ne be satisfied 


father

how will my wife for slaughter of my son
shed seas of tears and ne be satisfied 


king henry vi

how will the country for these woful chances
misthink the king and not be satisfied 


son

was ever son so rued a father death 


father

was ever father so bemoan his son 


king henry vi

was ever king so grieved for subjects  woe 
much is your sorrow  mine ten times so much 


son

i bear thee hence  where i may weep my fill 
exit with the body


father

these arms of mine shall be thy winding sheet 
my heart  sweet boy  shall be thy sepulchre 
for from my heart thine image ne shall go 
my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell 
and so obsequious will thy father be 
even for the loss of thee  having no more 
as priam was for all his valiant sons 
i bear thee hence  and let them fight that will 
for i have murdered where i should not kill 
exit with the body


king henry vi

sad hearted men  much overgone with care 
here sits a king more woful than you are 
alarums  excursions  enter queen margaret  prince edward  and exeter


prince edward

fly  father  fly  for all your friends are fled 
and warwick rages like a chafed bull 
away  for death doth hold us in pursuit 


queen margaret

mount you  my lord  towards berwick post amain 
edward and richard  like a brace of greyhounds
having the fearful flying hare in sight 
with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath 
and bloody steel grasp in their ireful hands 
are at our backs  and therefore hence amain 


exeter

away  for vengeance comes along with them 
nay  stay not to expostulate  make speed 
or else come after  i away before 


king henry vi

nay  take me with thee  good sweet exeter 
not that i fear to stay  but love to go
whither the queen intends  forward  away 
exeunt
