scene vi  another part of the field 


a loud alarum  enter clifford  wounded


clifford

here burns my candle out  ay  here it dies 
which  whiles it lasted  gave king henry light 
o lancaster  i fear thy overthrow
more than my body parting with my soul 
my love and fear glued many friends to thee 
and  now i fall  thy tough commixture melts 
impairing henry  strengthening misproud york 
the common people swarm like summer flies 
and whither fly the gnats but to the sun 
and who shines now but henry enemies 
o phoebus  hadst thou never given consent
that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds 
thy burning car never had scorch the earth 
and  henry  hadst thou sway as kings should do 
or as thy father and his father did 
giving no ground unto the house of york 
they never then had sprung like summer flies 
i and ten thousand in this luckless realm
had left no mourning widows for our death 
and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace 
for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air 
and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity 
bootless are plaints  and cureless are my wounds 
no way to fly  nor strength to hold out flight 
the foe is merciless  and will not pity 
for at their hands i have deserved no pity 
the air hath got into my deadly wounds 
and much effuse of blood doth make me faint 
come  york and richard  warwick and the rest 
i stabb your fathers  bosoms  split my breast 
he faints
alarum and retreat  enter edward  george  richard  montague  warwick  and soldiers


edward

now breathe we  lords  good fortune bids us pause 
and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks 
some troops pursue the bloody minded queen 
that led calm henry  though he were a king 
as doth a sail  fill with a fretting gust 
command an argosy to stem the waves 
but think you  lords  that clifford fled with them 


warwick

no   impossible he should escape 
for  though before his face i speak the words
your brother richard mark him for the grave 
and wheresoe he is  he surely dead 
clifford groans  and dies


edward

whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave 


richard

a deadly groan  like life and death departing 


edward

see who it is  and  now the battle ended 
if friend or foe  let him be gently used 


richard

revoke that doom of mercy  for  clifford 
who not contented that he lopp the branch
in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth 
but set his murdering knife unto the root
from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring 
i mean our princely father  duke of york 


warwick

from off the gates of york fetch down the head 
your father head  which clifford placed there 
instead whereof let this supply the room 
measure for measure must be answered 


edward

bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house 
that nothing sung but death to us and ours 
now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound 
and his ill boding tongue no more shall speak 


warwick

i think his understanding is bereft 
speak  clifford  dost thou know who speaks to thee 
dark cloudy death o his beams of life 
and he nor sees nor hears us what we say 


richard

o  would he did  and so perhaps he doth 
 but his policy to counterfeit 
because he would avoid such bitter taunts
which in the time of death he gave our father 


george

if so thou think st  vex him with eager words 


richard

clifford  ask mercy and obtain no grace 


edward

clifford  repent in bootless penitence 


warwick

clifford  devise excuses for thy faults 


george

while we devise fell tortures for thy faults 


richard

thou didst love york  and i am son to york 


edward

thou pitied rutland  i will pity thee 


george

where captain margaret  to fence you now 


warwick

they mock thee  clifford  swear as thou wast wont 


richard

what  not an oath  nay  then the world goes hard
when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath 
i know by that he dead  and  by my soul 
if this right hand would buy two hour life 
that i in all despite might rail at him 
this hand should chop it off  and with the
issuing blood
stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
york and young rutland could not satisfy 


warwick

ay  but he dead  off with the traitor head 
and rear it in the place your father stands 
and now to london with triumphant march 
there to be crowned england royal king 
from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france 
and ask the lady bona for thy queen 
so shalt thou sinew both these lands together 
and  having france thy friend  thou shalt not dread
the scatter foe that hopes to rise again 
for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt 
yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears 
first will i see the coronation 
and then to brittany i cross the sea 
to effect this marriage  so it please my lord 


edward

even as thou wilt  sweet warwick  let it be 
for in thy shoulder do i build my seat 
and never will i undertake the thing
wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting 
richard  i will create thee duke of gloucester 
and george  of clarence  warwick  as ourself 
shall do and undo as him pleaseth best 


richard

let me be duke of clarence  george of gloucester 
for gloucester dukedom is too ominous 


warwick

tut  that a foolish observation 
richard  be duke of gloucester  now to london 
to see these honours in possession
