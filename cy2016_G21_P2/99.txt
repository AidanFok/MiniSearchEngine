scene i  a forest in the north of england 


enter two keepers  with cross bows in their hands


first keeper

under this thick grown brake we shroud ourselves 
for through this laund anon the deer will come 
and in this covert will we make our stand 
culling the principal of all the deer 


second keeper

i stay above the hill  so both may shoot 


first keeper

that cannot be  the noise of thy cross bow
will scare the herd  and so my shoot is lost 
here stand we both  and aim we at the best 
and  for the time shall not seem tedious 
i tell thee what befell me on a day
in this self place where now we mean to stand 


second keeper

here comes a man  let stay till he be past 
enter king henry vi  disguised  with a prayerbook


king henry vi

from scotland am i stol n  even of pure love 
to greet mine own land with my wishful sight 
no  harry  harry   no land of thine 
thy place is fill d  thy sceptre wrung from thee 
thy balm wash off wherewith thou wast anointed 
no bending knee will call thee caesar now 
no humble suitors press to speak for right 
no  not a man comes for redress of thee 
for how can i help them  and not myself 


first keeper

ay  here a deer whose skin a keeper fee 
this is the quondam king  let seize upon him 


king henry vi

let me embrace thee  sour adversity 
for wise men say it is the wisest course 


second keeper

why linger we  let us lay hands upon him 


first keeper

forbear awhile  we hear a little more 


king henry vi

my queen and son are gone to france for aid 
and  as i hear  the great commanding warwick
is thither gone  to crave the french king sister
to wife for edward  if this news be true 
poor queen and son  your labour is but lost 
for warwick is a subtle orator 
and lewis a prince soon won with moving words 
by this account then margaret may win him 
for she a woman to be pitied much 
her sighs will make a battery in his breast 
her tears will pierce into a marble heart 
the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn 
and nero will be tainted with remorse 
to hear and see her plaints  her brinish tears 
ay  but she come to beg  warwick to give 
she  on his left side  craving aid for henry 
he  on his right  asking a wife for edward 
she weeps  and says her henry is deposed 
he smiles  and says his edward is install d 
that she  poor wretch  for grief can speak no more 
whiles warwick tells his title  smooths the wrong 
inferreth arguments of mighty strength 
and in conclusion wins the king from her 
with promise of his sister  and what else 
to strengthen and support king edward place 
o margaret  thus  be  and thou  poor soul 
art then forsaken  as thou went forlorn 


second keeper

say  what art thou that talk of kings and queens 


king henry vi

more than i seem  and less than i was born to 
a man at least  for less i should not be 
and men may talk of kings  and why not i 


second keeper

ay  but thou talk as if thou wert a king 


king henry vi

why  so i am  in mind  and that enough 


second keeper

but  if thou be a king  where is thy crown 


king henry vi

my crown is in my heart  not on my head 
not decked with diamonds and indian stones 
nor to be seen  my crown is called content 
a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy 


second keeper

well  if you be a king crown with content 
your crown content and you must be contented
to go along with us  for as we think 
you are the king king edward hath deposed 
and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
will apprehend you as his enemy 


king henry vi

but did you never swear  and break an oath 


second keeper

no  never such an oath  nor will not now 


king henry vi

where did you dwell when i was king of england 


second keeper

here in this country  where we now remain 


king henry vi

i was anointed king at nine months old 
my father and my grandfather were kings 
and you were sworn true subjects unto me 
and tell me  then  have you not broke your oaths 


first keeper

no 
for we were subjects but while you were king 


king henry vi

why  am i dead  do i not breathe a man 
ah  simple men  you know not what you swear 
look  as i blow this feather from my face 
and as the air blows it to me again 
obeying with my wind when i do blow 
and yielding to another when it blows 
commanded always by the greater gust 
such is the lightness of you common men 
but do not break your oaths  for of that sin
my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty 
go where you will  the king shall be commanded 
and be you kings  command  and i obey 


first keeper

we are true subjects to the king  king edward 


king henry vi

so would you be again to henry 
if he were seated as king edward is 


first keeper

we charge you  in god name  and the king s 
to go with us unto the officers 


king henry vi

in god name  lead  your king name be obey d 
and what god will  that let your king perform 
and what he will  i humbly yield unto 
exeunt
